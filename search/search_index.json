How do we sort the numbers efficiently?</p> <p>A simple way is to apply a comparison based sorting algorithm. But they cannot do better than \\(O(n \\log n)\\). Can we sort the array in linear time? Counting sort can not be applied here as we use keys as index in counting sort. Here keys are dsicrete floating point numbers.</p> <p>The idea is to use bucket sort.</p> <p>Bucket sort is a sorting algorithm that separate the elements into multiple groups said to be buckets. Elements in bucket sort are first divided into groups called buckets, and then they are sorted by any other sorting algorithm. After that, elements are gathered in a sorted manner.</p> <p>The basic procedure of performing the bucket sort is given as follows:</p> <ul> <li>First, partition the range into a fixed number of buckets.</li> <li>Then, toss every element into its appropriate bucket.</li> <li>After that, sort each bucket individually by applying a sorting algorithm.</li> <li>And at last, concatenate all the sorted buckets.</li> </ul> <p>Note: step 3 above is not necessarily to carried out separately after step 2.

The benefit of this practice is, if the array is uniformly dispersed, then element would fit into buckety quitely evenly, passing less job for further sorting within each bucket.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>As you can see from the above illustration, the auxilliary bucket array is the same length as the original array.</p> <p>Illustration of Bucket Sort on integers</p> <p>Of course, bucket sort can also be used to integers, in which case, we can choose a bucket number as we see most adapted to the given array.</p> <p>Given an array \\([10,8,20,7,16,18,12,1,23,11]\\). Based on the maximum number, we can roughly create buckets with a range from 0 to 25. The buckets range are 0-5, 5-10, 10-15, 15-20, 20-25. Elements are inserted in the buckets according to the bucket range. Suppose the value of an item is 16, so it will be inserted in the bucket with the range 15-20. Similarly, every item of the array will insert accordingly.</p> <p>The following phase is known to be the scattering of array elements.</p> <p></p> <p></p> <p>Now, sort each bucket individually.

The idea of radix sort is to do digit by digit sort starting from least significant digit to most significant digit.

This course is an introduction to concepts and case law relating to civil (i.e. non-criminal) disputes and civil liability arising from accidental or intentionally caused harms. The course examines the largest area of Tort law, the law of Negligence, which includes unintentionally caused injury to the person, damage to property, and harm to economic interests (including, in a distinct way, pure economic losses). Other major areas of Tort Law that will be examined are nuisance (unreasonable interference with the enjoyment of land), and intentional injuries whether to the person, property, or personal dignity and reputation. The course examines tort law within the context of changing social values, the deterrence of law, as well as corporate and governmental responsibility. The course emphasizes the uses of case law and actual tort litigation which explore topics from a theoretical and practical perspective.</p> <p>LAW 503 Course Author: Dr. Robert Russo is a Lecturer and full-time member of the Allard School of Law.</p> <p>Law 504A \u2013 Property Law (5 credits)</p> <p>Meets NCA Requirement for Property</p> <p>This course introduces the conceptual foundations of property, the basic principles of property law, and the legal regime that regulates land ownership and the transfer of interests in land in British Columbia. At the outset, it asks students to consider the nature, sources and justifications of private property. It also introduces the idea that property is an evolving social institution, one that is defined by its social, legal, historical, and even geographical contexts. The course then works through the common law and statutory frameworks that regulate land ownership in the common law jurisdictions in Canada, with particular focus on British Columbia. This includes analysis of: the physical dimensions of land ownership; the doctrine of tenure; freehold and leasehold interests; Aboriginal title; equitable interests; shared ownership; security interests such as mortgages; covenants and easements; and the land title registration system. </p> <p>Students will be evaluated on the basis of class participation, quizzes, and mid-term and final examinations.</p> <p>LAW 504 Course Author: Professor Doug Harris is a full time member of the Allard School of Law.</p> <p>Law 505 \u2013 Canadian Public Law (5 credits)</p> <p>Meets NCA Requirements for Foundations of Canadian Law and Canadian Constitutional Law</p> <p>This course will provide an overview of Canadian Public Law.

The second part of the course will focus on several rights and freedoms delineated in the Charter of Rights and Freedoms. The third part of the course will provide a brief introduction to how Canadian law regulates the relationship between Aboriginal peoples and the Canadian state. Throughout the course, students will be required to think critically about the Canadian legal system, and will gain insight into the relationship between law, public policy, and administration in Canada.

The body of administrative law is ubiquitous in Canada. It is Canadians\u2019 most common contact point with the legal system. Studying it is also key to understanding other legal areas relating to immigration and refugees, human rights, environmental protections, labour relations, indigenous governance, municipal governance, natural resources, social benefits, health and safety, professional self-governance, and licensing. Administrative law generally concerns the proper exercise of public authority. It focuses on using courts and other decision-making processes to access government benefits and goods or to challenge abuses of public power. Administrative law permits judges to review the procedures and decisions of a variety of government decision-makers (e.g., agencies, arbitrators, boards, commissions, ministers, municipalities, and tribunals) to ensure compliance with the rule of law. The content reviewed in this course includes reviewing the fairness of administrative procedures such as individuals\u2019 rights to participate in decisions affecting them in front of an independent, impartial and unbiased decision-maker. The course will also cover standards of judicial review, proportionality and remedies in administrative law. The content will include an examination of Aboriginal administrative law and covers principles of statutory interpretation relevant to administrative law.</p> <p>Students will be evaluated on class participation and a final examination.</p> <p>Law 509 Course Author: Robert Russo is the LLM CL Graduate Program Lecturer at the Allard School of Law</p> <p>LAW 515 \u2013 Canadian Private Law: Contractual Obligations and Remedies (5 Credits)</p> <p>Meets NCA Requirements for Contracts and Remedies</p> <p>The law of contractual obligations and remedies involves the common law doctrines that relate to the formation, operation, and breach of commercial and consumer agreements between individuals. This course looks at the historical development and major substantive areas of the law of contract, including those that deal with: formation and enforceability; problems in the performance of contracts (conditions, warranties, misrepresentation, mistake, frustration); breach and remedies for breach; standard form consumer contracts; exclusion of liability clauses and unconscionability.

The elements of offences, modes of liability, and defences will also be covered in detail. An overview of the purposes of sentencing and range of sentencing options will conclude the course.</p> <p>The evaluation in this course is comprised of an assessment of participation (i.e. completion of end-of-unit quizzes, a practice problem, and meaningful contribution to online discussion activities), a mid-term examination, and a final examination.</p> <p>LAW 525 Course Author: Associate Professor Benjamin Perrin is a full time member of the Allard School of Law</p> <p>LAW 588 - Ethics and Professionalism (3 Credits)</p> <p>Meets NCA Requirements for Canadian Professional Responsibility</p> <p>This course provides an introduction to the regulation of the legal profession in Canada, which is self-governing through provincial law societies that set standards and regulate professional conduct.  The professional obligations of lawyers to clients also extent to other lawyers and the court and arguably to society in general.  Successful practice requires lawyers to consciously work to fulfill all these obligations.  This course is designed to prepare those who plan to enter the practice of law and to bring an appreciation and understanding of the highly regulated nature of the legal profession.  Sessions will consist of a mixture of video lectures, text readings, and online quizzes and discussions including student case and topic briefings.  Throughout the course, we will refer to the B.C. Law Society\u2019s Code of Professional Conduct for British Columbia and within that context discuss the ethical issues facing lawyers.  Some of these issues include ethics and the adversarial system; the balance between effective client representation and a commitment to the public interest, and; the professional obligations associated with specific practice roles and working with vulnerable clients.</p> <p>Law 588 Course Author: Dr. Robert Russo is the LLM CL Graduate Program Lecturer at the Allard School of Law</p>","tags":["UBC","Orientation"]},{"location":"UBC-laws/orientation/#online-learning-platform-canvas","title":"Online Learning Platform: Canvas","text":"<p>Canvas is UBC\u2019s new mobile-friendly online learning platform.</p> <p>If you have any technical problems accessing Canvas you can contact UBC IT and Canvas Learning support by email at distance.education@ubc.ca or by phone at 604-822-9836 or 1-877-272-1422.</p> <p>I no longer want to take this course.

Common Law and Stare Decisis","text":"<p>Canadian law is heavily shaped by its colonial inheritance, particularly from Britain and France. The principle of \u201creception\u201d governed how European legal traditions applied in the colonies. In \u201csettled\u201d colonies (believed to be unoccupied), English common law was presumed to apply automatically unless expressly altered. In contrast, \u201cconquered\u201d colonies retained their pre-existing laws until formally changed. This distinction was complicated in Canada by the presence of Indigenous legal systems and competing French claims. </p> <p>Quebec, for example, retained French civil law in private matters after the Quebec Act of 1774, while the rest of the provinces largely adopted English common law. This created Canada\u2019s current bijural system: a mixture of civil and common law traditions.</p> <p>The common law system, inherited from England, is built not on codified statutes but on judicial precedent. Past court decisions (case law) serve as authoritative rules that guide future judgments in similar fact scenarios. This is the doctrine of stare decisis, which fosters legal certainty, fairness, and efficiency. </p> <p>However, judges are not bound by everything said in a previous ruling - only the ratio decidendi (the legal reasoning essential to the outcome) is binding; other remarks (called obiter dicta) are not. Courts also consider their position in the judicial hierarchy: lower courts are bound by higher courts, and even appellate courts may reconsider their past rulings, especially if the precedent was weak or unclear.</p> <p>The Canadian system has nuanced rules about when precedent is binding. For example, all courts must follow decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada and pre-1949 rulings of the Privy Council unless overruled. However, courts in one province are not bound by appellate rulings in another. Judges often face challenges in determining what part of a ruling counts as precedent, particularly when reasoning is ambiguous or multiple opinions are given. Despite these complexities, the doctrine of precedent remains a cornerstone of the Canadian legal system and contributes significantly to its structure and predictability.</p> <p>a. Vertical Stare Decisis</p> <p>Vertical stare decisis means that decisions from higher courts are binding on lower courts within the same judicial hierarchy. This doctrine maintains consistency in the interpretation of law and ensures that trial judges do not contradict rulings from appellate courts.</p> <p>In British Columbia, for example, all decisions from the British Columbia Court of Appeal are binding on the BC Supreme Court and the Provincial Court of BC. If a judge in the BC Supreme Court disagrees with a decision of the BC Court of Appeal, they are nevertheless bound to follow it. Only the Supreme Court of Canada stands above the provincial courts of appeal, and its decisions are binding across the entire country.</p> <p>This structure ensures a top-down uniformity in legal reasoning. A trial court cannot substitute its own interpretation for that of a superior court, even if it finds the higher court's decision to be outdated or flawed. The appropriate remedy in such a case would be to distinguish the facts or, where possible, to await clarification or reversal by a higher court.</p> <p>b. Horizontal Stare Decisis</p> <p>Horizontal stare decisis refers to the practice of courts following their own previous decisions or those of courts at the same level within the same jurisdiction. This principle supports legal certainty but allows a degree of flexibility.</p> <p>Within the BC Supreme Court, judges generally follow past decisions of other BC Supreme Court judges. While technically not binding, these decisions are treated as strongly persuasive. This practice promotes stability and predictability, especially in areas of law where appellate guidance may be sparse. That said, a judge may depart from a peer\u2019s earlier decision if convinced that it was wrongly decided or if new reasoning or legislation has emerged.</p> <p>The BC Court of Appeal generally follows its own prior decisions. However, it does have the authority to overrule itself in appropriate circumstances. When doing so, the court will often sit as a five-judge panel (rather than the usual three) to reconsider significant legal issues, as was done in R. v. Sidhu (2015 BCCA 224), which revisited previous interpretations of sentencing principles.</p> <p>c. Exceptions to Horizontal Precedent: Re Hansard Spruce Mills</p> <p>The leading case on when courts can depart from their own level\u2019s precedent is Hansard Spruce Mills Limited (Re), 1954 CanLII 253 (BC SC), a decision of the BC Supreme Court. In that case, Justice Wilson articulated three narrowly defined situations where a trial-level judge could decline to follow a decision from another judge of the same court:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Subsequent Higher Court Ruling: If the earlier decision is undermined by a higher court (e.g., the BC Court of Appeal or Supreme Court of Canada), it may no longer be good law.</p> </li> <li> <p>Decided Per Incuriam: If the earlier decision failed to consider relevant statutory or case law, it may be treated as made in error and thus non-binding.</p> </li> <li> <p>Made Under Exigent Circumstances: Where the earlier ruling was given without full argument or in an emergency context, it may not warrant continued application.</p> </li> </ul> <p>These criteria have been adopted widely across Canadian provinces and were recently reaffirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada in R. v. Sullivan, 2022 SCC 19. The Court emphasized that departures from precedent at the same level should remain exceptional, to avoid judicial inconsistency and uncertainty.</p> <p>d. Inter-provincial Precedent</p> <p>In Canada's federal structure, each province maintains its own judicial hierarchy. This means that decisions from, say, the Ontario Court of Appeal are not binding on courts in British Columbia. However, they are often treated as persuasive authority, particularly when:</p> <ul> <li> <p>There is no binding appellate authority on the issue within BC;</p> </li> <li> <p>The reasoning is well-articulated and grounded in shared national legal principles;</p> </li> <li> <p>Uniformity in law across provinces is desirable (e.g., commercial law, Charter interpretation).</p> </li> </ul> <p>It\u2019s also common for judges to canvass precedent across multiple provinces when writing decisions with broader implications. This comparative approach helps build coherence in Canadian jurisprudence even without formal binding force across provincial borders.</p> <p>e. Ratio Decidendi vs. Obiter Dicta</p> <p>Not all parts of a court decision carry equal legal weight. The ratio decidendi is the central legal rule or principle necessary to resolve the case. It is the binding part of the judgment that must be followed in future cases dealing with similar facts or issues.</p> <p>By contrast, obiter dicta refers to incidental remarks, hypothetical examples, or broader observations made by the judge that were not essential to the outcome. These comments may offer helpful guidance but are not binding. Nevertheless, particularly influential obiter statements, especially from higher courts, may carry considerable persuasive value.</p> <p>Determining what constitutes the ratio can be complex, especially in appellate judgments with multiple concurring opinions. In such cases, the ratio is usually distilled from the shared reasoning that commanded the majority of the court.</p> <p>Canada v. Craig, 2012 SCC 43 at paras 24-27</p> <ul> <li>This part of the decision is about \"B. Should This Court Overrule Moldowan?\"</li> <li> <p>[26] Courts must proceed with caution when deciding to overrule a prior decision.  In Queensland v. Commonwealth (1977), 139 C.L.R. 585 (H.C.A.), at p. 599, Justice Gibbs articulated the required approach succinctly:</p> <p>No Justice is entitled to ignore the decisions and reasoning of his predecessors, and to arrive at his own judgment as though the pages of the law reports were blank, or as though the authority of a decision did not survive beyond the rising of the Court.  A Justice, unlike a legislator, cannot introduce a programme of reform which sets at nought decisions formerly made and principles formerly established.  It is only after the most careful and respectful consideration of the earlier decision, and after giving due weight to all the circumstances, that a Justice may give effect to his own opinions in preference to an earlier decision of the Court.</p> </li> <li> <p>[27] The vertical convention of precedent is not at issue with respect to the decision as to whether the Supreme Court should overrule one of its own precedents. Rather, in making this decision the Supreme Court engages in a balancing exercise between the two important values of correctness and certainty.  The Court must ask whether it is preferable to adhere to an incorrect precedent to maintain certainty, or to correct the error.</p> </li> </ul> <p>Carter v. Canada, 2015 SCC 5 at paras 40-48</p> <ul> <li>This part of the decision discussed the issue: whether this Court\u2019s decision in Rodriguez can be revisited?</li> <li>[43] ... Ontario goes so far as to argue that \u201cvertical stare decisis\u201d is a constitutional principle that requires all lower courts to rigidly follow this Court\u2019s Charter precedents unless and until this Court sets them aside.</li> <li>[44] However, stare decisis is not a straitjacket that condemns the law to stasis.  Trial courts may reconsider settled rulings of higher courts in two situations:  (1) where a new legal issue is raised; and (2) where there is a change in the circumstances or evidence that \u201cfundamentally shifts the parameters of the debate\u201d.</li> </ul>","tags":["LAW 505: Canadian Public Law","Unit 1"]},{"location":"UBC-laws/L505/505Unit1/#iii-statutory-law","title":"III.

Parliament and provincial legislatures have full authority to create new laws or change existing ones.

In some areas, the common law remains foundational, but in others, especially those governed by detailed statutory regimes, the law is almost entirely codified.</p> <p>The relationship between statutes and common law is not always simple. Generally, when legislation clearly contradicts a prior court decision, the statutory rule takes priority. </p> <p>Complexity arises when a statute is vague or silent on a point that the common law has already addressed. This is where courts may continue to apply established case law or interpret how the two sources of law interact. A good example of this interplay is found in the development of same-sex marriage in Canada, which involved a mix of constitutional rulings, evolving statutory provisions, and reinterpretation of longstanding legal definitions.</p>","tags":["LAW 505: Canadian Public Law","Unit 1"]},{"location":"UBC-laws/L505/505Unit1/#iv-international-law","title":"IV. International Law","text":"<p>In modern legal systems, law operates on two distinct levels: domestic and international. Domestic law consists of the rules and principles that govern the daily affairs of individuals within a state. In Canada, this includes statutes enacted by legislatures and regulations created by the executive, alongside the common law (judge-made legal rules developed through precedent). </p> <p>Constitutional law sits at the top of this hierarchy and includes both written texts, like the Constitution Act, 1867, and unwritten principles that shape Canada's democratic framework.</p> <p>International law, by contrast, regulates the conduct of states on the global stage. Its two primary sources are treaties (formal agreements between states) and customary international law (general practices accepted as law). Treaties can be bilateral or multilateral and may take various forms, such as conventions or protocols. They become binding only on the states that consent to them. Customary international law, however, applies more broadly, even to states that haven't explicitly consented, as long as there is widespread state practice and a belief that such practice is legally required. A notable example is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which, although originally not legally binding, has increasingly been treated as reflecting customary law.</p> <p>Canada takes a \"dualist\" approach to treaties, meaning that an international agreement does not automatically become part of domestic law upon ratification. Instead, legislation must be enacted to give it domestic effect. This process ensures parliamentary control but can lead to a gap where Canada is internationally bound yet domestically non-compliant. This dualist structure also reflects Canada\u2019s federal system, where both federal and provincial governments hold legislative powers. The requirement for legislative transformation safeguards democratic legitimacy by involving elected representatives.</p> <p>However, Canada's approach to customary international law is different. Here, Canada is more \u201cmonist,\u201d meaning that once a rule is recognized as customary international law, it becomes part of Canadian common law automatically, unless explicitly overridden by statute. This raises legitimacy concerns because customary norms are incorporated through judicial recognition rather than elected legislative action. Courts, not legislatures, play a key role in determining the domestic legal status of these international norms. Additionally, the content of customary law can be vague, and judges may rely on expert testimony from international lawyers to interpret it. While this may seem at odds with Canadian democratic traditions, it fits within the broader role Canadian courts have always played in shaping the common law.</p>","tags":["LAW 505: Canadian Public Law","Unit 1"]},{"location":"UBC-laws/L505/505Unit2/","title":"Components of Canadian Government","text":"","tags":["LAW 505: Canadian Public Law","Unit 2"]},{"location":"UBC-laws/L505/505Unit2/#21-parliament-and-the-legislative-process","title":"2.1 Parliament and the Legislative Process","text":"<p>The Canadian Parliament has three constituent parts:</p> <ul> <li>The Monarch of the United Kingdom.

It is also responsible for the administration of the Supreme Court of Canada and federally created courts.</p> <p>Canada has four levels of court:</p> <ul> <li>Provincial and territorial (lower) courts: These courts handle most cases that come into the system. They are established by provincial and territorial governments.</li> <li>Provincial and territorial superior courts: These are courts of plenary, or complete, jurisdiction established under section 96 of the Constitution Act, 1867. They deal with more serious crimes and also hear appeals from provincial and territorial courts. The Federal Court is on the same level, but is responsible for deciding civil matters assigned to it by statute, such as immigration and patents.</li> <li>Provincial and territorial courts of appeal and the Federal Court of Appeal.</li> <li>The Supreme Court of Canada, which is the final court of appeal for Canada.</li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Provincial/territorial courts</p> <ul> <li>most criminal offences, except the most serious ones;</li> <li>family law matters (e.g., child support, child protection, adoption, but not divorce);</li> <li>young persons from 12 to 17 years old in conflict with the law; traffic and bylaw violations;</li> <li>provincial/territorial regulatory offences;</li> <li>claims involving money, up to a certain amount (set by the province or territory in question);</li> <li>small claims (civil cases that resolve private disputes involving limited sums of money); and</li> <li>all preliminary inquiries (hearings to determine whether there is enough evidence to justify a full trial in serious criminal cases).</li> </ul> <p>Provincial/territorial superior courts</p> <p>The superior courts try the most serious criminal and civil cases. The jurisdiction of superior courts originally came from the first courts in England, whose authority over government actions was based on Magna Carta.</p> <p>The superior courts also act as a court of first appeal for the provincial and territorial courts that the provinces and territories maintain. Although the provinces and territories administer superior courts, the federal government appoints and pays the judges.</p> <p>Family courts</p> <p>In most provinces and territories, the superior court has special divisions, such as the family division. Some superior courts have established specialized family courts to deal with specific family law matters, including divorce and property claims.</p> <p>Provincial/territorial courts of appeal</p> <p>These courts hear appeals from the decisions of the superior courts and the provincial/territorial courts. Appeals are usually heard by a panel of three judges. The courts of appeal also hear constitutional questions that may be raised in appeals involving individuals, governments, or governmental agencies.</p> <p>The Federal Court</p> <p>The federal court system runs parallel to the provincial and territorial court systems and consists of the Federal Court and the Federal Court of Appeal. The judges of these courts (as well as the Tax Court of Canada, described below) are based in Ottawa, but travel across the country to hear cases. They deal with certain matters specified in federal statutes (laws), such as immigration and refugee law, navigation and shipping, intellectual property, and tax.</p> <p>The Federal Court is Canada\u2019s national trial court. It hears and decides federal legal disputes whose subject matter has been assigned to the Court by Parliament. These disputes include:</p> <ul> <li>claims against the Government of Canada;</li> <li>civil suits between private parties in federally-regulated areas; and</li> <li>reviews of the decisions of most federal tribunals.</li> </ul> <p>The Federal Court of Appeal</p> <p>The Federal Court of Appeal hears appeals from the Federal Court and the Tax Court of Canada, and judicial reviews of certain federal tribunals listed in the Federal Courts Act. The Court hears most legal matters under federal jurisdiction or that involve the federal government.</p> <p>Specialized Federal Courts</p> <p>The federal government has created specialized courts to deal more effectively with certain areas of the law. These include the Tax Court of Canada and the courts that serve the military justice system: the military courts and the Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada. </p> <p>The Tax Court of Canada is a superior court that determines cases and appeals about matters that arise under federal tax and revenue legislation. The Tax Court of Canada hears disputes between the federal government and taxpayers after the taxpayer has pursued all other avenues provided for by the Income Tax Act. The Tax Court is independent of the Canada Revenue Agency and all other government departments.</p> <p>Military courts, or courts martial, are established under the National Defence Act to hear cases involving the Code of Service Discipline. The Court Martial Appeal Court of Canada hears appeals from military courts. </p> <p>The Supreme Court of Canada</p> <p>The Court consists of a Chief Justice and eight other justices. Members of the Court are appointed by the federal government as new vacancies occur. Three judges traditionally come from Ontario, two from Western Canada, and one from the Atlantic provinces. In addition, the Supreme Court Act requires that at least three judges must come from Quebec.</p> <p>Did you know?</p> <p>The Supreme Court sits in Ottawa for three sessions a year, winter, spring, and fall. Each year the Supreme Court considers an average of between 500 to 600 applications for leave to appeal and hears 65 to 80 appeals.</p> <p>The Supreme Court can also be asked by the Governor in Council to hear references. These are important questions of law, such as the constitutionality or interpretation of federal or provincial legislation, on which the Court is asked to give its opinion before an actual legal dispute arises.</p> <p>Administrative Tribunals and Boards</p> <p>Administrative tribunals are less formal than courts and are not part of the court system. However, they play an essential role in resolving disputes in Canadian society. Decisions of administrative tribunals may be reviewed in court to ensure that tribunals act fairly and according to the law.</p> <p> Judicial independence</p> <ul> <li>Security of tenure: Once appointed, a judge is eligible to serve on the bench until retirement (age 75 for federally appointed judges, age 70 in some provincial/territorial jurisdictions). Judges can be removed by a joint address of Parliament or a provincial legislature, only after an independent and impartial investigation shows that there is good reason (see Judicial Conduct, below).</li> <li>Financial security: Judges must be guaranteed sufficient compensation (including salary and pension) so they are not subject to pressure for financial considerations. In Canada, governments cannot change judges\u2019 salaries or benefits without first receiving the recommendations of an independent compensation commission.</li> <li>Administrative independence: No one can interfere with how courts manage the legal process and exercise their judicial functions.

Judicial Independence","text":"<p>A. Core Characteristics and Dimensions</p> <p>The three core characteristics of judicial independence were first identified in Valente v. The Queen (1985). </p> <ul> <li>The first is security of tenure. Judges must not be subject to arbitrary removal, as they hold office until the mandatory retirement age and can only be removed through a formal and rigorous process. This ensures that judges are free to make decisions based on law and principle without fear of losing their position. </li> <li>The second characteristic is financial security. Judges\u2019 salaries cannot be altered at the whim of the executive or legislature. Instead, their remuneration is set and maintained by law, typically through an independent process. This protects judges from being swayed by threats of reduced pay or enticed by the promise of increased benefits. </li> <li>The third characteristic is administrative independence. Judges must retain control over matters that relate directly to the adjudicative function, including the assignment of cases and the management of courtrooms. This prevents external interference in the judicial process. </li> </ul> <p>Judicial independence also has two dimensions. </p> <ul> <li>The first is individual independence, which refers to the ability of each judge to decide cases free from external influence. This dimension ensures that the judgment of a particular case is not compromised by political, financial, or administrative pressures. </li> <li>The second is institutional independence, which relates to the judiciary as a whole. Courts must be protected as an institution from interference by the executive or legislative branches of government. This dimension preserves the separation of powers and ensures that the judiciary can function as a co-equal branch of government.</li> </ul> <p>B. The Marshall Inquiry</p> <p>The Commissioners emphasized that judicial independence requires strong protection, but it cannot insulate judges from all accountability. They set out a high threshold for removal that has since become central to Canadian law:</p> <p>\u201cIs the conduct alleged so manifestly and profoundly destructive of the concept of the impartiality, integrity and independence of the judicial role, that public confidence would be sufficiently undermined to render the judge incapable of executing the judicial office?\u201d</p> <p>This test makes clear that removal is not justified by legal errors or unpopular decisions, which are matters for appeal. Instead, it is reserved for serious misconduct or incapacity that so erodes public confidence in the judiciary that the judge can no longer perform the role with the impartiality and integrity expected of the office.</p> <p>The Supreme Court of Canada later reaffirmed this principle in Therrien (Re), 2001 SCC 35.</p> <p>Read</p> <ul> <li>Judicial Independence.</li> <li>s.80 of the Judges Act, RSC 1985, c J-1.</li> </ul>","tags":["LAW 505: Canadian Public Law","Unit 2"]},{"location":"UBC-laws/L505/505Unit2/#24-the-interplay-between-branches-of-government-statutory-interpretation","title":"2.4 The Interplay Between Branches of Government: Statutory Interpretation","text":"<p>One major way in which the relationships between branches of government are mediated is through practices of statutory interpretation.</p>","tags":["LAW 505: Canadian Public Law","Unit 2"]},{"location":"UBC-laws/L505/505Unit2/#i-the-doctrine-of-strict-construction","title":"I.

Those questions were:</p> <ul> <li>Under the Constitution of Canada, can the National Assembly, legislature or government of Quebec effect the secession of Quebec from Canada unilaterally?</li> <li>Does international law give the National Assembly, legislature or government of Quebec the right to effect the secession of Quebec from Canada unilaterally? In this regard, is there a right to self\u2011determination under international law that would give the National Assembly, legislature or government of Quebec the right to effect the secession of Quebec from Canada unilaterally?</li> <li>In the event of a conflict between domestic and international law on the right of the National Assembly, legislature or government of Quebec to effect the secession of Quebec from Canada unilaterally, which would take precedence in Canada?</li> </ul> <p>The Supreme Court of Canada responded in a very important judgment referred to as the Quebec Secession Reference, [1998] 2 SCR 217.</p> <p>Readings</p> <p>Constitutional Law: pages 30-39.</p> <p>The Canadian Constitution encompasses five components:</p> <ul> <li>Parliamentary democracy is the mechanism that ensures that primary legal rules (statutes) are created by elected legislative bodies.</li> <li>Federalism is the division of \u201corders of government\u201d along territorial lines. In Canada, federalism\u2019s most critical function is to allocate the powers of different legislatures: Parliament at the national level and assemblies/legislatures at the provincial level.</li> <li>Rights: claims that citizens, either individually or in particular communities, have against the state.</li> <li>Aboriginal rights, are recognized by the Constitution as belonging to Indigenous peoples in light of the fact that they lived on this continent in organized societies long before their contact with European nations.</li> <li>constitutionalism refers to the requirement that state power be limited by overarching rules and norms that cannot be changed by ordinary legislative processes. Another feature of the Constitution is the rule of law, an expansive, complex, and challenging concept. At its most basic, the rule of law means that governments exercise power according to law, not arbitrarily.</li> </ul> <p>Readings</p> <ul> <li>The Supreme Court of Canada revisited the test for the granting of public interest standing in Canada (Attorney General) v. Downtown Eastside Sex Workers United Against Violence Society, 2012 SCC 45 (\u201cDESUAV\u201d) case.</li> <li>[2] In exercising their discretion with respect to standing, the courts weigh three factors in light of these underlying purposes and of the particular circumstances. The courts consider whether the case raises a serious justiciable issue, whether the party bringing the action has a real stake or a genuine interest in its outcome and whether, having regard to a number of factors, the proposed suit is a reasonable and effective means to bring the case to court.<ul> <li>Serious Justiciable Issue: [42] To constitute a \u201cserious issue\u201d, the question raised must be a \u201csubstantial constitutional issue\u201d or an \u201cimportant one\u201d. The claim must be \u201cfar from frivolous\u201d, although courts should not examine the merits of the case in other than a preliminary manner.</li> <li>The Nature of the Plaintiff\u2019s Interest: [43] In my view, this factor is concerned with whether the plaintiff has a real stake in the proceedings or is engaged with the issues they raise. In Finlay, for example, although the plaintiff did not in the Court\u2019s view have standing as of right, he nonetheless had a direct, personal interest in the issues he sought to raise. In Borowski, the Court found that the plaintiff had a genuine interest in challenging the exculpatory provisions regarding abortion. He was a concerned citizen and taxpayer and he had sought unsuccessfully to have the issue determined by other means...</li> <li>Reasonable and Effective Means of Bringing the Issue Before the Court: [52] This factor, like the other two, must be assessed in a flexible and purposive manner and weighed in light of the other factors.</li> </ul> </li> <li>[3] ... The appeal raises one main question: whether the three factors which courts are to consider in deciding the standing issue are to be treated as a rigid checklist or as considerations to be taken into account and weighed in exercising judicial discretion in a way that serves the underlying purposes of the law of standing. In my view, the latter approach is the right one.</li> <li>[22] ... The Court has recognized that, in a constitutional democracy like Canada with a Charter of Rights and Freedoms, there are occasions when public interest litigation is an appropriate vehicle to bring matters of public interest and importance before the courts.</li> </ul> <p>How do constitutional cases come before the courts in Canada? In short, there are three main ways:</p> <ul> <li>The government may launch a \u201creference\u201d asking the Court for an \u201cadvisory opinion\u201d on a constitutional issue (e.g. the Quebec Secession Reference);</li> <li>Where a party is directly affected either by a law (e.g. they are charged with a crime) or government action, they may argue that the law (or government action) is unconstitutional; or</li> <li>Where a party is not directly affected by a law (or government action), they may seek \u201cpublic interest standing\u201d to challenge the constitutionality of the law or government action.</li> </ul>","tags":["LAW 505: Canadian Public Law","Unit 3"]},{"location":"UBC-laws/L505/505Unit3/#32-constitutional-interpretation","title":"3.2 Constitutional Interpretation","text":"<p>Readings</p> <p>Constitutional Law: Chapter 2 (pp. 19-29)</p> <p>Interpreting the provisions of a constitutional text raises many complex issues, including:</p> <ul> <li>the intentions of the drafters</li> <li>the role of the constitution in framing political practices and institutions</li> <li>community identity and shared values</li> </ul> <p>Forms of constitutional argumentation include historical, textual, doctrinal, prudential, ethical and structural.</p> <p>Example: Persons Case</p> <ul> <li>Reference re meaning of the word \u201cPersons\u201d in s.24 of British North America Act, 1928 CanLII 55</li> <li>Edwards v.

The part now belonging to the federal government was taken from the jurisdiction of the provinces.</li> </ol> <p>THE POWER OF DISALLOWANCE</p> <p>The power, as expressed in ss 56 and 90 of the Constitution Act, 1867, entitles the governor general, acting on the advice of the federal Cabinet, to disallow (or veto) any enactment of the provincial legislatures.</p> <p>By the mid-20th century, the federal power of disallowance fell into disuse.</p> <p>Canada (AG) v Ontario (AG)</p> <ul> <li>Canada (Attorney General) v Ontario (Attorney General), 1937 CanLII 362 (UK JCPC), on appeal from References re the Weekly Rest in Industrial Undertakings Act, The Minimum Wages Act, And The Limitation of Hours of Work Act, 1936 CanLII 24.</li> <li>Within the British Empire there is a well-established rule that the making of a treaty is an executive act, while the performance of its obligations, if they entail alteration of the existing domestic law, requires legislative action.</li> <li>The first ground upon which counsel for the Dominion sought to base the validity of the legislation was s. 132 ... it was not contemplated in 1867 that the Dominion would possess treaty-making powers, it is impossible to strain the section so as to cover the un-contemplated event.

If the new functions affect the classes of subjects enumerated in s. 92, legislation to support the new functions is in the competence of the Provincial Legislatures only.

For this reason, arguments about political community in Canada tend to focus on the relative role and power of federal and provincial authorities.</li> <li>The second set of criteria may be labelled functional.

However, Federalism does not resolve the classic problem of majority versus minority rights.</li> <li>A second strand of democratic theorizing stresses the advantages of smaller units in terms of governmental responsiveness and citizen participation.

Could we argue, for example, that community should be preferred when the impugned legislation relates to the social sphere, functional efficiency when the impugned legislation relates to the economic sphere, and democracy when the impugned legislation relates to the political sphere?

In addition, a court may look to the purpose of the legislation. The effects of the legislation may also be relevant. The dominant form of inquiry is into purpose, that is, to the problem underlying the legislation which the legislature is trying to address.</li> <li>Despite the reference to the \u201cexclusivity\u201d of the classes in sections 91 and 92, there is opportunity for extensive overlapping regulation. Similar laws may fit within both federal and provincial heads of power. The courts often uphold such legislation using the \u201cdouble aspect doctrine,\u201d whereby they acknowledge that some laws may have both federal and provincial purposes.</li> <li>there are competing perspectives of the ideal system, with views about the proper distribution of legislative powers shaped by the individual\u2019s belief in other values promoted or protected by federalism, such as a stronger national or regional community responsive to the country\u2019s needs or loyalties, or increased economic efficiency.</li> </ul> <p>William R Lederman, \u201cClassification of Laws and the British North America Act\u201d</p> <ul> <li>the categories of laws enumerated in sections 91 and 92 are not in the logical sense mutually exclusive; they overlap or encroach upon one another in many more respects than is usually realized.</li> <li>When a particular rule has features of meaning relevant to both federal and provincial classes of laws, then the question must be asked, is it better for the people that this thing be done on a national level, or on a provincial level? Inevitably, widely prevailing beliefs in the country about these issues will be influential and presumably the judges should strive to implement such beliefs.</li> <li>the challenged law will have features of meaning relevant to both federal and provincial classes of laws.

Morgentaler, 1993 CanLII 74, continues to illustrate the kinds of factors a court can take into account in determining the matter or the pith and substance of a law.</p> <p>R. v. Morgentaler</p> <ul> <li>The question in this appeal is whether the Nova Scotia Medical Services Act, RSNS 1989, c. 281, and the regulation made under the Act, NS Reg. 152/89, are ultra vires the province of Nova Scotia on the ground that they are in pith and substance criminal law.</li> <li>On the basis of the analysis that follows I conclude that the Medical Services Act and Medical Services Designation Regulation are criminal law in pith and substance and consequently ultra vires the province of Nova Scotia. The appeal must therefore be dismissed.</li> <li>A law\u2019s \u201cmatter\u201d is its leading feature or true character, often described as its pith and substance. There is no single test for a law\u2019s pith and substance. While both the purpose and effect of the law are relevant considerations, it is often the case that the legislation\u2019s dominant purpose or aim is the key to constitutional validity.</li> <li>Evidence of the \u201ceffect\u201d of legislation can be relevant in two ways: to establish \u201clegal effect\u201d and to establish \u201cpractical effect.\u201d</li> <li>In determining the background, context and purpose of challenged legislation, the court is entitled to refer to extrinsic evidence of various kinds provided it is relevant and not inherently unreliable.</li> <li>Provincial legislation has been held invalid when it employs language \u201cvirtually indistinguishable\u201d from that found in the Criminal Code. The duplication of Criminal Code language may raise an inference that the province has stepped into the realm of the criminal law; the more exact the reproduction, the stronger the inference.</li> <li>The primary objective of the legislation was to prohibit abortions outside hospitals as socially undesirable conduct, and any concern with the safety and security of pregnant women or with health care policy, hospitals or the regulation of the medical profession was merely ancillary.</li> </ul> <p>When the courts determine that legislation on its face addresses matters that are within its jurisdiction, but in pith and substance it is directed at matters outside its jurisdiction, they normally say the legislation is \u201ccolourable.\u201d</p> <p>In its decision in Reference re Fire-arms Act (Can), 2000 SCC 31, the Supreme Court of Canada provided the following description of the colourability doctrine in the context of a broader discussion of the way in which a law\u2019s effects are taken into account in the characterization process:</p> <p>[18] Determining the legal effects of a law involves considering how the law will operate and how it will affect Canadians. ... the inquiry is directed to how the law sets out to achieve its purpose in order to better understand its \u201ctotal meaning\u201d. In some cases, the effects of the law may suggest a purpose other than that which is stated in the law. In other words, a law may say that it intends to do one thing and actually do something else. Where the effects of the law diverge substantially from the stated aim, it is sometimes said to be \u201ccolourable.\u201d</p> <p>The law with respect to the evidence that can be brought to bear in characterizing legislation has recently been summarized by Karakatsanis J in Reference re Genetic Non-Discrimination Act, 2020 SCC 17:</p> <p>[34] To determine a law\u2019s purpose, a court looks to both intrinsic and extrinsic evidence. Intrinsic evidence includes the text of the law, and provisions that expressly set out the law\u2019s purpose, as well as the law\u2019s title and structure. Extrinsic evidence includes statements made during parliamentary proceedings and drawn from government publications: Reference re Firearms Act (Can.), 2000 SCC 31, at para. 17.</p> <p>Courts are still on occasion asked to define the scope and meaning of one of the heads of power in s 91 or 92. That occurred in a reference by the Quebec government to the Quebec Court of Appeal that ended up in the Supreme Court of Canada, Reference re Employment Insurance Act (Can), ss 22 and 23, 2005 SCC 56, excerpted below.</p> <p>The specific head of power at issue in that case was s 91(2A), which grants jurisdiction to Parliament over unemployment insurance. s 91(2A) was added to the list of heads of power in s 91 in 1940 after the Privy Council struck down the Employment and Social Insurance Act, SC 1935, c 38, a federal statute enacted in 1934 as part of Canada\u2019s \u201cNew Deal\u201d that represented the first attempt to provide unemployment insurance to Canadian workers. (Canada (Attorney General) v. Ontario (Attorney General), 1937 CanLII 363 (UK JCPC))</p> <p>The primary interpretive question raised by the 2005 reference was whether the courts should be bound, as the government of Quebec argued, to give effect to the particular conception of unemployment insurance that the federal and provincial politicians responsible for adding s 91(2A) to the federal catalogue of powers in 1940 had in mind.</p> <p>Reference re Employment Insurance Act (Can), ss 22 and 23, 2005 SCC 56</p> <ul> <li>[9] In giving them predominant weight, the Quebec Court of Appeal adopted an original intent approach to interpreting the Constitution rather than the progressive approach the Court has taken for a number of years.</li> <li>[40] If the objectives of the framers are taken as a starting point, it will be easier to determine the scope of the jurisdiction that was transferred, and then to determine how it may be adapted to contemporary realities.</li> <li>[68] In pith and substance, maternity benefits are a mechanism for providing replacement income during an interruption of work. This is consistent with the essence of the federal jurisdiction over unemployment insurance\u3002</li> </ul> <p>The Supreme Court of Canada recently summarized the modern approach with regard to interpretation of constitutional provisions in R. v. Comeau, 2018 SCC 15:</p> <p>[52] The text of the provision must be read harmoniously with the context and purpose of the statute. Constitutional texts must also be interpreted in a manner that is sensitive to evolving circumstances because they \u201cmust continually adapt to cover new realities\u201d.Finally, the underlying organizational principles of the constitutional texts, like federalism, may be relevant to their interpretation.</p>","tags":["LAW 505: Canadian Public Law","Unit 4"]},{"location":"UBC-laws/L505/505Unit4/#b-double-aspect-doctrine","title":"B.

The purpose must be aligned with the traditional scope of criminal law, which is primarily focused on protecting society.</p> <p>The Margarine Reference is specifically associated with solidifying the requirement that the legislation must have a legitimate criminal law objective.

Public morality is one of the foundational and historic purposes of criminal law.</li> <li>Public Safety and Health: These concepts define broad areas where the criminal law power is unquestionably relevant, encompassing acts or omissions that are injurious to public health or threaten public peace and order.</li> <li>Harm/Evil: The overarching element connecting these purposes is the suppression of evil, or conduct considered injurious or undesirable to the public.</li> </ul> <p>If a prohibition and penalty are aimed primarily at regulating purely economic transactions or securing compliance with a non-criminal scheme (e.g., a provincial trade scheme), rather than suppressing a recognized public evil, it will be deemed constitutionally invalid.

His reading of that document was influenced by a classical vision of the federal system, which demanded respect for the autonomy of the federal, as well as the provincial governments in the areas of jurisdiction which the constitution allocated to each.

Act).</li> <li>The core of the justification rested on the concept that the economic conditions at the time amounted to a national crisis or emergency requiring temporary federal action.</li> <li>[1] Justification Based on National Economic Crisis (Laskin C.J.)<ul> <li>Chief Justice Laskin, writing for four members of the majority, held that the Anti-Inflation Act (AIA) was valid legislation because it was a temporary measure to meet a situation of economic crisis imperilling the well-being of the people of Canada as a whole.</li> <li>The justification required that Parliament have a rational basis for viewing the legislation as temporarily necessary to meet the situation. This rational basis was supported by:<ul> <li>Evidence of Grave Economic Conditions: The Court was provided with extrinsic materials (like Statistics Canada data and the Government White Paper) showing that Canada was experiencing the coexistence of high inflation (double-digit rates) and rising unemployment (the \"twin conditions\"). These figures demonstrated a drop in the purchasing power of the dollar and rising cost of living indices.</li> <li>Need for Intervention in the National Interest: The preamble of the AIA stated that inflation at current levels was \"contrary to the interests of all Canadians\" and had become a \"matter of serious national concern\". The Court found that the gravity of the circumstances provided a base for assessing the need for the legislation.</li> <li>Temporary and Focused Nature: The Act was upheld partly due to its temporary character, even though it was subject to extension. Furthermore, the federal government was entitled to act from the \"springboard\" of its exclusive jurisdiction over monetary policy to extend its embrace into provincial sectors under the general POGG power, given the circumstances.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Laskin C.J. noted that the Court only needed to persuade itself that there was a rational basis for Parliament's judgment, not that the exceptional circumstances were proven as a matter of fact.</li> </ul> </li> <li>[2] Justification Based on National Economic Emergency (Ritchie J.)<ul> <li>Justice Ritchie, writing for three members of the majority, explicitly based the validity of the AIA on whether the legislation was enacted to combat a national economic emergency.<ul> <li>Application of Emergency Doctrine: He found nothing to exclude applying the constitutional principles enunciated in previous wartime and post-war emergency cases to a situation created by highly exceptional economic conditions in time of peace.</li> <li>Transcendence of Provincial Authority: The conditions constituted an urgent and critical situation adversely affecting all Canadians and were of such proportions as to transcend the authority vested in the Legislatures of the Provinces.</li> <li>Evidence of Emergency: He relied on the White Paper, which described the inflationary process as \"so deeply entrenched\" that it was a \"critical problem\" jeopardizing \"the whole fabric of our economy and of our society,\" leading him to conclude that the language confirmed Parliament was acting in recognition of a national emergency.</li> <li>Temporary Limitation: This authority to invade the provincial area is strictly limited to dealing with critical conditions and must be confined to legislation of a temporary character.</li> <li>Rejection of \"National Dimension\" Doctrine: Ritchie J. was explicit that the validity of the Act did not rest on the permanent \"national dimension\" or \"national concern\" doctrine, which, in his view, could only justify intervention if the concern manifested circumstances amounting to a national emergency.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Dissenting View on Justification: The dissenting justices (Beetz and de Grandpr\u00e9 JJ.) argued that the AIA directly and ostensibly interfered with matters exclusively provincial (property and civil rights; law of contract).<ul> <li>Rejection of \"National Concern\": They rejected the idea that inflation, as a broad, non-specific issue, could permanently become a subject matter of federal power under the national concern doctrine, arguing this would \"render most provincial powers nugatory\" and destroy the federal nature of the Constitution.</li> <li>Rejection of \"Emergency\": They assumed that Parliament could act under an emergency power in peacetime, but held that the exercise of this extraordinary power must be done in the most explicit terms (a proclamation or unmistakable signal). Since the AIA did not explicitly declare or signal that it was passed to deal with a national emergency, the constitutional foundation was fatal, and the Court could not indirectly be called upon to proclaim the state of emergency.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>One significant aspect of the Anti-Inflation case was the introduction and use of extrinsic evidence. In Reference re Upper Churchill Water Rights Reversion Act, 1984 CanLII 17 (SCC), the Supreme Court of Canada clarified (at 318) that \"in constitutional cases, particularly where there are allegations of colourability, extrinsic evidence may be considered to ascertain not only the operation and effect of the impugned legislation but its true object and purpose as well.\"</p> <p>EMERGENCY LEGISLATION AFTER THE ANTI-INFLATION REFERENCE</p> <p>The federal Parliament enacted new legislation to deal with national emergencies in 1988: see the Emergencies Act, RSC 1985, c 22 (4th Supp), enacted by SC 1988, c 29.</p> <p>The law contains provisions dealing with different types of emergencies, including public welfare, public order, international, and war emergencies. Of special interest to us are the public welfare emergencies (including those caused by real or imminent fires, floods, disease, accident, or pollution amounting to a national emergency).</p> <p>While the federal Cabinet (governor in council) can declare an emergency, the declaration must concisely describe the state of affairs constituting the emergency, and it must be confirmed by Parliament. As well, the declaration cannot be made without prior consultation with affected provincial governments and an agreement by the provincial Cabinet that the province is unable to deal with the situation.</p> <p>THE NATIONAL CONCERN DOCTRINE FROM THE ANTI-INFLATION REFERENCE TO THE GREENHOUSE GAS POLLUTION PRICING ACT REFERENCES</p> <p>The national concern doctrine emerged again in R. v. Hauser, 1979 CanLII 13 (SCC), summarized by Le Dain J in R. v. Crown Zellerbach Canada Ltd., 1988 CanLII 63 (SCC).</p> <p>Prior to References Re Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, 2021 SCC 11, the leading modern case on the national concern doctrine was Crown Zellerbach.</p> <p>[29] In Hauser, a majority of the Court (Martland, Ritchie, Pigeon and Beetz J.J.) held that the constitutional validity of the Narcotic Control Act rested on the peace, order and good government power of Parliament rather than on its jurisdiction with respect to criminal law. ... since it (the abuse of narcotic drugs) did not come within matters of a merely local or private nature in the province it fell within the \u201cgeneral residual power\u201d in the same manner as aeronautics and radio.</p> <p>To invoke the the \"national concern doctrine\" of the POGG power, Justice Le Dain drew four conclusions:</p> <ol> <li>The national concern doctrine is separate and distinct from the national emergency doctrine of the peace, order and good government power, which is chiefly distinguishable by the fact that it provides a constitutional basis for what is necessarily legislation of a temporary nature;</li> <li>The national concern doctrine applies to both new matters which did not exist at Confederation and to matters which, although originally matters of a local or private nature in a province, have since, in the absence of national emergency, become matters of national concern;</li> <li>For a matter to qualify as a matter of national concern in either sense it must have a singleness, distinctiveness and indivisibility that clearly distinguishes it from matters of provincial concern and a scale of impact on provincial jurisdiction that is reconcilable with the fundamental distribution of legislative power under the Constitution;</li> <li>In determining whether a matter has attained the required degree of singleness, distinctiveness and indivisibility that clearly distinguishes it from matters of provincial concern, it is relevant to consider what would be the effect on extra-provincial interests of a provincial failure to deal effectively with the control or regulation of the intra-provincial aspects of the matter. The last one was referred to as \u201cprovincial inability\u201d test.</li> </ol> <p>During the three decades between Crown Zellberbach and the References re Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, the Supreme Court did not once uphold federal legislation on the basis of the national concern branch.</p> <p>The major modern case on the national concern doctrine is References re Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act.</p> <p>References re Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act, 2021 SCC 11 (CanLII)</p> <ul> <li>Federalism is a foundational principle of the Canadian Constitution. Its objectives are to reconcile diversity with unity, promote democratic participation by reserving meaningful powers to the local and regional level and foster cooperation between Parliament and the provincial legislatures for the common good. Under the division of powers, broad powers were conferred on the provinces to ensure diversity, while at the same time reserving to the federal government powers better exercised in relation to the country as a whole to provide for Canada\u2019s unity. Federalism recognizes that within their spheres of jurisdiction, provinces have autonomy to develop their societies. Federal power cannot be used in a manner that effectively eviscerates provincial power.</li> <li>Courts, as impartial arbiters, are charged with resolving jurisdictional disputes over the boundaries of federal and provincial powers on the basis of the principle of federalism. Although early Canadian constitutional decisions by the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council applied a rigid division of federal-provincial powers as watertight compartments, the Court has favoured a flexible view of federalism, best described as a modern cooperative federalism, that accommodates and encourages intergovernmental cooperative efforts. However, the Court has also always maintained that flexibility and cooperation, while important, cannot override or modify federalism and the constitutional division of powers.</li> <li>The review of legislation on federalism grounds consists of the well-established two-stage analytical approach.<ul> <li>At the first stage, a court must consider the purpose and effects of the challenged statute or provision with a view to characterizing the subject matter or \u201cpith and substance\u201d. A court must then classify the subject matter with reference to federal and provincial heads of power under the Constitution in order to determine whether it is intra vires Parliament and therefore valid.<ul> <li>At the first stage of the division of powers analysis, a court must consider the purpose and effects of the challenged statute or provision in order to identify its \u201cpith and substance\u201d or its main thrust or dominant or most important characteristic. In determining the purpose of the challenged statute or provision, a court can consider both intrinsic evidence, such as the legislation\u2019s preamble or purpose clauses, and extrinsic evidence, such as Hansard or minutes of parliamentary committees. In considering the effects of the challenged legislation, a court can consider both the legal effects, those that flow directly from the provisions of the statute itself, and the practical effects, the side effects that flow from the application of the statute. The characterization process is not technical or formalistic. A court can look at the background and circumstances of a statute\u2019s enactment as well as at the words used in it.</li> <li>Three points with respect to the identification of the pith and substance are important to clarify. First, the pith and substance of a challenged statute or provision must be described as precisely as possible. The pith and substance of a challenged statute or provision should capture the law\u2019s essential character in terms that are as precise as the law will allow. Second, it is permissible in some circumstances for a court to include the legislative choice of means in the definition of a statute\u2019s pith and substance, as long as it does not lose sight of the fact that the goal of the analysis is to identify the true subject matter of the challenged statute or provision. In some cases, the choice of means may be so central to the legislative objective that the main thrust of a statute or provision, properly understood, is to achieve a result in a particular way, which would justify including the means in identifying the pith and substance. Third, the characterization and classification stages of the division of powers analysis are and must be kept distinct. The pith and substance of a statute or a provision must be identified without regard to the heads of legislative competence.</li> </ul> </li> <li>At the second stage of the division of power analysis, a court must classify the matter by reference to the heads of power set out in the Constitution. Matters and classes of subjects are distinct. Law-making powers are exercisable in relation to matters, which in turn generally come within broader classes of subjects. Section 91 does not provide in the context of the POGG power that Parliament can make laws in relation to classes of subjects; instead, it states that Parliament can make laws for the peace, order, and good government of Canada in relation to \u201cMatters\u201d. National concern is a well-established but rarely applied doctrine of Canadian constitutional law derived from the introductory clause of s. 91 of the Constitution, which empowers Parliament to make laws for the peace, order, and good government of Canada, in relation to all matters not coming within the classes of subjects assigned exclusively to the legislatures of the provinces. A matter that falls under the POGG power necessarily does not come within the classes of subjects enumerated in ss. 91 and 92.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Courts must approach a finding that the federal government has jurisdiction on the basis of the national concern doctrine with great caution. The effect of finding that a matter is one of national concern is permanent and confers exclusive jurisdiction over that matter on Parliament. However, the scope of the federal power is defined by the nature of the national concern itself and only aspects with a sufficient connection to the underlying inherent national concern will fall within the scope of the federal power.</li> <li>A closely related question concerns the applicability of the double aspect doctrine to a matter of national concern. The double aspect doctrine recognizes that the same fact situations can be regulated from different perspectives, one of which may relate to a provincial power and the other to a federal power. The doctrine can apply in cases in which the federal government has jurisdiction on the basis of the national concern doctrine. Such an approach fosters coherence in the law, because the double aspect doctrine can apply to every enumerated federal and provincial head of power. It is also consistent with the modern approach to federalism, which favours flexibility and a degree of overlapping jurisdiction. However, the fact that the double aspect doctrine can apply does not mean that it will apply in a given case. It may apply if a fact situation can be regulated from different federal and provincial perspectives and each level of government has a compelling interest in enacting legal rules in relation to that situation. It should be applied cautiously so as to avoid eroding the importance attached to provincial autonomy.</li> <li>The double aspect doctrine takes on particular significance where Canada asserts jurisdiction over a matter that involves a minimum national standard imposed by legislation that operates as a backstop. The recognition of a matter of national concern such as this will inevitably result in a double aspect situation. This is in fact the very premise of a federal scheme that imposes minimum national standards: Canada and the provinces are both free to legislate in relation to the same fact situation but the federal law is paramount. In such a case, even if the national concern test would otherwise be met, a cautious approach to the double aspect doctrine should act as an additional check. The court must be satisfied that Canada in fact has a compelling interest in enacting legal rules over the federal aspect of the activity at issue and that the multiplicity of aspects is real and not merely nominal.</li> <li>Turning to the national concern test, there are two points worth noting about the framework as a whole.<ul> <li>First, the recognition of a matter of national concern must be based on evidence. An onus rests on Canada throughout the national concern analysis to adduce evidence in support of its assertion of jurisdiction.</li> <li>Second, there is no requirement that a matter be historically new in order to be found to be one of national concern. Many new developments may be predominantly local and provincial in character and fall under provincial heads of power. The term \u201cnew\u201d, as used in the jurisprudence, refers to matters that could satisfy the national concern test and includes both \u201cnew\u201d matters that did not exist in 1867 and matters that are \u201cnew\u201d in the sense that the understanding of those subject matters has, in some way, shifted so as to bring out their inherently national character. Thus, the critical element of the analysis is the requirement that matters of national concern be inherently national in character, not that they be historically new.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Finding that a matter is one of national concern involves a three-step analysis.<ul> <li>First, as a threshold question, Canada must establish that the matter is of sufficient concern to the country as a whole to warrant consideration as a possible matter of national concern.</li> <li>Second, the matter must have a singleness, distinctiveness and indivisibility.</li> <li>Third, Canada must show that the proposed matter has a scale of impact on provincial jurisdiction that is reconcilable with the division of powers. The purpose of the national concern analysis is to identify matters of inherent national concern \u2014 matters which, by their nature, transcend the provinces.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The analysis begins by asking, as a threshold question, whether the matter is of sufficient concern to Canada as a whole to warrant consideration under the national concern doctrine. This invites a common-sense inquiry into the national importance of the proposed matter. This approach does not open the door to the recognition of federal jurisdiction simply on the basis that a legislative field is important; it operates to limit the application of the national concern doctrine and provides essential context for the analysis that follows.</li> <li>The second step of the analysis requires that a matter have a singleness, distinctiveness and indivisibility that clearly distinguishes it from matters of provincial concern. Two principles underpin this requirement: first, to prevent federal overreach, jurisdiction should be found to exist only over a specific and identifiable matter that is qualitatively different from matters of provincial concern; and second, federal jurisdiction should be found to exist only where the evidence establishes provincial inability to deal with the matter.<ul> <li>Under the first principle of the singleness, distinctiveness and indivisibility analysis, the court should inquire into whether the matter is predominantly extra-provincial and international in its nature or its effects, into the content of any international agreements in relation to the matter, and into whether the matter involves a federal legislative role that is distinct from and not duplicative of that of the provinces. It is clearly not enough for a matter to be quantitatively different from matters of provincial concern \u2014 the mere growth or extent of a problem across Canada is insufficient to justify federal jurisdiction. International agreements may in some cases indicate that a matter is qualitatively different from matters of provincial concern. However, the existence of treaty obligations is not determinative of federal jurisdiction as there is no freestanding federal treaty implementation power and Parliament\u2019s jurisdiction to implement treaties signed by the federal government depends on the ordinary division of powers. Furthermore, to be qualitatively different from matters of provincial concern, the matter must not be an aggregate of provincial matters.</li> <li>The second principle underpinning the singleness, distinctiveness, and indivisibility analysis is that federal jurisdiction should be found to exist only where the evidence establishes provincial inability to deal with the matter. Provincial inability functions as a strong constraint on federal power and should be seen as a necessary but not sufficient requirement for the purposes of the national concern doctrine. In order for provincial inability to be established both of these factors are required:<ul> <li>(1) the legislation should be of a nature that the provinces jointly or severally would be constitutionally incapable of enacting; and</li> <li>(2) the failure to include one or more provinces or localities in a legislative scheme would jeopardize the successful operation of the scheme in other parts of the country.</li> <li>And there is a third factor that is required in the context of the national concern doctrine in order to establish provincial inability: a province\u2019s failure to deal with the matter must have grave extra-provincial consequences. The requirement for grave extra-provincial consequences sets a high bar for a finding of provincial inability for the purposes of the national concern doctrine and can be satisfied by actual harm or by a serious risk of harm being sustained in the future. It may include serious harm to human life and health or to the environment, though it is not necessarily limited to such consequences. Mere inefficiency or additional financial costs stemming from divided or overlapping jurisdiction is clearly insufficient. Evaluating extra-provincial harm helps to determine whether a national law is not merely desirable, but essential, in the sense that the problem is beyond the power of the provinces to deal with it. This connects the provincial inability test to the overall purpose of the national concern test, which is to identify matters of inherent national concern that transcend the provinces.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>At the third and final step of the national concern analysis, Canada must show that the proposed matter has a scale of impact on provincial jurisdiction that is reconcilable with the fundamental distribution of legislative power under the Constitution. The purpose of the scale of impact analysis is to protect against unjustified intrusions on provincial autonomy and prevent federal overreach. At this stage of the analysis, the intrusion upon provincial autonomy that would result from empowering Parliament to act is balanced against the extent of the impact on the interests that would be affected if Parliament were unable to constitutionally address the matter at a national level. Identifying a new matter of national concern will be justified only if the latter outweighs the former.</li> </ul>","tags":["LAW 505: Canadian Public Law","Unit 4"]},{"location":"UBC-laws/L505/505Unit4/#45-interpreting-the-division-of-powers-applicability","title":"4.5 Interpreting the Division of Powers: Applicability","text":"<p>Even if a law is found to be validly enacted, it is possible for it to be rendered inapplicable to a certain circumstance in order to protect the core of the other government's jurisdiction.

In contrast, inter-jurisdictional immunity emphasizes the exclusivity of jurisdiction, and works to prevent certain forms of overlap.</p> <p>Readings</p> <ul> <li>Constitutional Law: Chapter 8 (pp. 250-252, 256-267)</li> <li>Canadian Western Bank v The Queen in Right of Alberta</li> <li>Quebec (Attorney General) v Canadian Owners and Pilots Association</li> </ul> <p>In those circumstances where the doctrine of inter-jurisdictional immunity is engaged, valid laws are not allowed to apply in core areas of jurisdiction assigned to the other level of government. </p> <p>Although the doctrine of inter-jurisdictional immunity has been used only to protect core areas of federal legislative jurisdiction from encroaching provincial legislation, the Supreme Court of Canada has acknowledged that the doctrine can in principle work the other way, see Canada (AG) v PHS Community Services Society, 2011 SCC 44 at paras 57-70 and Carter v Canada (AG), 2015 SCC 5 at paras 49-53. ... it is a technique of interpretation used to save statutes from being struck down.</p> <p>The doctrine of inter-jurisdictional immunity has indeed been controversial. Three major concerns have been expressed about it: </p> <ul> <li>(1) in its emphasis on exclusivity of jurisdiction, it is at odds with the tendency of modern federalism to allow considerable overlap between federal and provincial powers; </li> <li>(2) it appeared to extend to the federal level of government an exclusivity of jurisdiction not available to the provinces and hence is inconsistent with a balanced approach to Canadian federalism (note that this concern would no longer be valid today, at least at the level of principle, because the Supreme Court of Canada has accepted that the doctrine works both ways); and </li> <li>(3) it is unnecessary because if Parliament wants to protect one of its core areas of legislative jurisdiction from encroaching provincial legislation, it can do so by enacting legislation to cover that area and rely on the federal paramountcy doctrine to oust the provincial legislation. </li> </ul> <p>The doctrinal choices that typically face the Court:</p> <ul> <li>One option is to allow the provincial law to apply to the federal undertaking or other federal matter until Parliament enacts conflicting legislation, which will then have priority by virtue of the doctrine of paramountcy. </li> <li>The other is to grant the requested inter-jurisdictional immunity to the federal undertaking or other federal matter, with the result that the provincial law is held inapplicable, even if Parliament has not legislated on the matter. </li> </ul> <p>Canadian Western Bank v. Alberta, 2007 SCC 22</p> <ul> <li>The Supreme Court of Canada, in Canadian Western Bank v. Alberta, rejected the appellants' claim that the provincial Insurance Act and its regulations were constitutionally inapplicable to their promotion of insurance products by virtue of the doctrine of inter-jurisdictional immunity (IJI).</li> <li>The court's reasoning regarding the inter-jurisdictional immunity doctrine can be summarized based on general constitutional principles and their specific application to the facts of the case:</li> <li>The joint reasons (Binnie and LeBel JJ.) emphasized that IJI is a doctrine of limited application and must be restricted to its proper limits.<ul> <li>Purpose and Scope: IJI recognizes that the Constitution Act, 1867 is based on an allocation of exclusive powers, although these powers inevitably interact. The doctrine protects the \"basic, minimum and unassailable content\" (or \"core\") of an exclusive federal power, such as banking under s. 91(15), from encroachment by provincial legislation.</li> <li>Flexible Federalism: A broad application of IJI is inconsistent with the flexible federalism promoted by doctrines like pith and substance and double aspect, which are generally better suited to resolving overlapping powers.</li> <li>Indispensability: Its application is justified only where it is considered absolutely indispensable or necessary to enable Parliament or a provincial legislature to achieve the purpose of its exclusive jurisdiction, or to enable a federal undertaking to carry out its specific mandate.</li> <li>The Impairment Test: To trigger the application of IJI, it is not enough for the provincial legislation merely to \"affect\" the federal core. The court explicitly rejected the substitution of \"affects\" for \"impairs\". Immunity applies only when the adverse impact of the provincial law increases in severity from affecting to \"impairing\" the core competence or the vital/essential part of the federal undertaking. \"Vital\" or \"essential\" means absolutely indispensable or necessary.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Quebec (Attorney General) v. Canadian Owners and Pilots Association, 2010 SCC 39 (CanLII)</p> <ul> <li>The central dispute involved whether Quebec\u2019s Act respecting the preservation of agricultural land and agricultural activities (ARPALAA), which requires prior authorization to use agricultural land for non-agricultural purposes (like an aerodrome), impaired the federal exclusive power over aeronautics.</li> <li>The majority applied the two-step IJI framework, as refined in Canadian Western Bank: <ul> <li>(1) determining if the provincial law trenches on the protected core of a federal competence, and </li> <li>(2) determining if the resulting impact is sufficiently serious (impairment).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Identification of the Federal Core<ul> <li>Federal Power: The federal government has exclusive jurisdiction over aeronautics under the Peace, Order, and good Government (POGG) power (s. 91 of the Constitution Act, 1867).</li> <li>Core Content: Precedent firmly establishes that the federal aeronautics jurisdiction includes the exclusive power to determine the location of aerodromes and airports. The location of aerodromes is considered an essential and indivisible part of aeronautics and therefore lies within the protected core of the federal power.</li> <li>Trenching: Since section 26 of the ARPALAA purports to limit where aerodromes can be located (prohibiting non-agricultural uses without prior authorization), it follows that the provincial law trenches on the core of the federal aeronautics power.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Test for Impairment<ul> <li>The Impairment Standard: Drawing on Canadian Western Bank, the court confirmed that the test is whether the provincial law impairs the federal exercise of the core competence. Impairment is a higher standard than \"affects\" but does not require complete paralysis (sterilization). It requires a significant or serious intrusion on the federal power.</li> <li>Finding of Impairment: The majority concluded that the provincial prohibition does impair the federal power.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Conclusion: The provincial law was rendered inapplicable to the extent it prohibits aerodromes in agricultural zones.</li> <li>Rejection of Counter-Arguments: The majority rejected the argument that because paramountcy might allow Parliament to override the provincial law, the impairment was insignificant (a \"sterilization\" test). </li> </ul>","tags":["LAW 505: Canadian Public Law","Unit 4"]},{"location":"UBC-laws/L505/505Unit4/#46-interpreting-the-division-of-powers-operability","title":"4.6 Interpreting the Division of Powers: Operability","text":"<p>A valid, applicable provincial law may still be found to be inoperable to the extent that it conflicts with a federal law.

This asks whether the provincial legislation duplicates the federal legislation.</li> <li>Impossibility of giving dual effect (usually placed under the rubric of impossibility of dual compliance, but arguably better understood as a distinct understanding in its own right).</li> <li>Frustration of federal purpose. This asks whether permitting the provincial enactment to operate in the circumstances in question would serve to frustrate the purpose underlying the federal enactment.</li> <li>Federal intention to cover the field (also known as \u201cnegative implication\u201d or \u201coccupy-ing the field\u201d). This asks whether Parliament, by legislating in a particular area, has enacted a code that was intended to be complete and thus by implication was intended to oust the operation of any provincial laws.</li> </ol> <p>Ross v. Registrar of Motor Vehicles et al., 1973 CanLII 176 (SCC)</p> <ul> <li>The Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) majority held that the provincial legislation was operative despite the federal provision, concluding there was no direct conflict or repugnancy. </li> <li>Justice Pigeon, writing for the majority, concluded that Section 21 of the Highway Traffic Act is operative legislation notwithstanding s. 238(1) of the Criminal Code.</li> <li>Lack of Repugnancy/Simultaneous Operation: The majority reasoned that there was no direct repugnancy between the two laws because both could fully operate simultaneously.<ul> <li>The federal Criminal Code (s. 238(1)) merely provides for the making of prohibitory orders (which may be limited as to time and place).</li> <li>If a provincial licence suspension is in effect during the period covered by the federal order, the person concerned gets no benefit from the indulgence granted under the federal legislation (i.e., the partial right to drive). However, this situation is not legally different from the earlier case of Provincial Secretary of Prince Edward Island v. Egan, where the provincial suspension operated even when the magistrate made no prohibitory order at all.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Scope of Federal Legislation: Parliament, through the 1972 amendments to s. 238 of the Criminal Code, did not purport to deal generally with the right to drive a motor vehicle after a conviction for certain offenses. The amendment only granted the magistrate a larger area of discretion to issue an order limited as to time and place.</li> <li>Criminal Code Order Deemed Without Jurisdiction: The judge who varied Ross\u2019s sentence included a provision that Ross\u2019s operator\u2019s licence was not to be suspended. The majority viewed this specific direction as having been made by an inferior court completely without jurisdiction and is to be ignored.</li> <li>Civil Consequences vs. Punishment: The majority reaffirmed the settled principle that civil consequences of a criminal act are not to be considered as \"punishment\" so as to bring the matter within the exclusive jurisdiction of Parliament. The suspension of a driving licence under provincial law is considered such a civil consequence. This principle ensures that the provincial legislation, which deals with licensing (a civil matter), is not impeachable as prescribing penalties for the criminal offense.</li> <li>Rejection of Implicit Permission: Citing cases like O\u2019Grady v. Sparling and Mann v. The Queen, the majority reiterated that Parliament, when defining criminal offenses, did not implicitly permit conduct that did not meet the definition of the Criminal Code offense. Similarly, Parliament did not implicitly permit driving by authorizing a magistrate to make a limited order.</li> <li>Relevance of Australian Doctrine (Exhaustiveness): The majority noted the Australian constitutional rule that inconsistency depends on the intention of the paramount Legislature to express the law completely, exhaustively, or exclusively. The majority indicated that if this rule were applied, it would have to be concluded that Parliament did not purport to state exhaustively the law respecting motor driving licences, or their suspension or cancellation for driving offenses.</li> </ul> <p>The narrower approach to paramountcy that emerged in the highway traffic cases in the 1960s and 1970s was confirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada in 1982 in Multiple Access Ltd v McCutcheon, immediately below, which is regarded as the foundational case on the modern approach to paramountcy.</p> <p>Multiple Access Ltd. v. McCutcheon, 1982 CanLII 55 (SCC)</p> <ul> <li>The primary issue on paramountcy was: Assuming both the federal insider trading provisions (ss. 100.4 and 100.5 of the Canada Corporations Act) and the provincial provisions (ss. 113 and 114 of the Ontario Securities Act) are constitutionally valid (intra vires), are the Ontario sections suspended and rendered inoperative concerning federally incorporated companies due to the doctrine of paramountcy?</li> <li>The Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) majority concluded that the provincial provisions were not rendered inoperative by federal paramountcy. Justice Dickson, writing for the majority, emphasized a narrow test for the application of federal paramountcy, concluding that mere duplication of federal and provincial law is insufficient to trigger the doctrine.</li> <li>The Test for Conflict (Repugnancy): The majority reaffirmed the established test for conflict (repugnancy), which requires actual conflict in operation. Conflict exists only when one enactment says \"yes\" and the other says \"no,\" or when compliance with one law is defiance (or breach) of the other.</li> <li>Duplication is Not Conflict: The court explicitly stated that mere duplication without actual conflict or contradiction is not sufficient to invoke paramountcy.</li> <li>Choice of Remedies: The majority rejected the argument that because a plaintiff can only resort to one statute (federal or provincial) to recover loss or gain once, the two laws are in conflict and cannot operate concurrently. Safeguards against double recovery exist, such as the requirement for judicial authorization of proceedings under the Ontario Act.</li> <li>Purpose of Parliamentary Legislation: The majority reasoned that the legislative purpose of Parliament (in creating the federal insider trading law) will be fulfilled regardless of which statute the remedy-seeker invokes. The application of the provincial law, therefore, does not displace the federal legislative purpose.</li> <li>Federal Legislation is ultra vires: They determined that ss. 100.4 and 100.5 of the Canada Corporations Act were not valid corporate legislation but rather concerned the protection of the general public from suffering loss on investments, which falls under the exclusive provincial power over \"property and civil rights\". They concluded that the federal sections were ultra vires Parliament.</li> <li>Paramountcy Not Addressed: Because these justices found the federal legislation invalid, it was unnecessary to consider the paramountcy issue (Question 3), as the issue does not arise unless both laws are held valid as independent enactments.</li> </ul> <p>Bank of Montreal v. Hall, 1990 CanLII 157 (SCC)</p> <ul> <li>The Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) concluded that there was an actual conflict in operation between the federal and provincial statutes, and accordingly, the provincial provisions were rendered inoperative (or, more precisely, inapplicable) to security taken under the federal Act.</li> <li>The Test for Paramountcy (Actual Conflict). Justice La Forest, writing for the Court, applied the standard test for paramountcy established in Multiple Access Ltd. v. McCutcheon.<ul> <li>The Test: Conflict (or repugnancy) exists only where there is actual conflict in operation, meaning \"where one enactment says 'yes' and the other says 'no'\". This occurs when compliance with one law is defiance of the other.</li> <li>Rejection of Duplication/Delay: The court noted that mere delay in the bank's ability to realize on its security, as argued by the Court of Appeal majority, does not automatically imply inconsistency, but paramountcy is invoked when the application of the provincial statute frustrates Parliament's legislative purpose.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The Court found a clear and actual operational conflict between the specific provisions of the two statutes:<ul> <li>Federal Legislative Purpose: The federal provisions give the bank an immediate, unqualified right to seize and sell the secured property upon the borrower\u2019s default, subject only to conditions within the Bank Act itself. This scheme was specifically designed to provide a uniform security mechanism nationwide, freeing borrowers and lenders from deferring to a variety of provincial lending regimes. </li> <li>Provincial Requirement (The Conflict): The provincial LCR Act (ss. 19-36) sets out a comprehensive procedure designed to prescribe how a secured creditor must take possession. </li> <li>Repugnancy: The LCR Act\u2019s requirement for judicial approval and prior notice restricts the unqualified right of seizure granted by the federal legislation. Compliance with the federal statute (immediate seizure right) necessarily entails defiance of the provincial counterpart.</li> <li>Frustration of Purpose: Requiring the bank to defer to the provincial legislation, would effectively displace the legislative purpose of Parliament to create a uniform, readily enforceable national security interest. The federal legislative intent was that the sole realization scheme applicable to the s. 178 security interest be that contained in the Bank Act itself.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>After Hall, it appeared that the \u201cconflict in operation\u201d referred to in Multiple Access that is necessary to give rise to federal paramountcy can be satisfied by either an impossibility of dual compliance or an incompatibility of legislative purposes. </p> <p>Rothmans, Benson &amp; Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan, 2005 SCC 13 (CanLII)</p> <ul> <li>The Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) unanimously held that the provincial legislation was not rendered inoperative by the doctrine of federal legislative paramountcy.</li> <li>The Court reaffirmed that federal paramountcy dictates that where validly enacted but overlapping provincial and federal legislation are inconsistent, the provincial legislation is inoperative to the extent of the inconsistency. The overarching principle is that a provincial enactment must not frustrate the purpose of a federal enactment.</li> <li>Inconsistency can be established in two ways:<ul> <li>Impossibility of Dual Compliance (Direct Conflict): This exists where one enactment says \"yes\" and the other says \"no,\" meaning compliance with one is defiance of the other. Impossibility of dual compliance is sufficient to establish inconsistency, but it is not the only test.</li> <li>Frustration of Legislative Purpose (Conflict of Purpose): This focuses on the broader question of whether the operation of the provincial Act is compatible with the federal legislative purpose.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>","tags":["LAW 505: Canadian Public Law","Unit 4"]},{"location":"UBC-laws/L505/505Unit5/","title":"The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms","text":"<p>The adoption of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms in 1982 marked an important change in Canadian constitutional law.

Any attempt by government to influence university decisions, especially decisions regarding appointment, tenure and dismissal of academic staff, would be strenuously resisted by the universities on the basis that this could lead to breaches of academic freedom.</li> <li>Justice Wilson then set out three tests to help identify the kinds of bodies that ought to be constrained by the Charter: <ul> <li>(1) the \u201ccontrol\u201d test, which asks whether the legislative, executive, or administrative branch of government exercises general control over the entity in question; </li> <li>(2) the \u201cgovernment function\u201d test, which asks whether the entity performs a traditional government function or a function that in more modern times is recognized as the responsibility of government; and </li> <li>(3) the \u201cstatutory authority and public interest\u201d test, which asks whether the entity is one that acts pursuant to statutory authority specifically granted to it to enable it to further an objective that government seeks to promote in the broader public interest.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>In Douglas/kwantlen Faculty Assn. v. Douglas College, 1990 CanLII 63 (SCC), which involved a community college ...The Court was unanimous in concluding that the Charter applied to the actions of the college in the negotiation and administration of the collective agreement between itself and the association representing the teachers and librarians at the college.</p> <p>In Lavigne v. Ontario Public Service Employees Union, 1991 CanLII 68 (SCC), Justice La Forest rejected the submission that the Charter should apply only to the regulatory activities of government, leaving its commercial or contractual activities exempt. Contemporary governments may pursue policies by engaging in commercial activities and should not be exempt from the Charter when they do so.</p> <p>The Supreme Court of Canada has not yet ruled on the issue of whether public schools are subject to the Charter. The Court assumed, without deciding, that public schools \u201cconstitute part of government\u201d (R. v. M. (M.R.), 1998 CanLII 770 (SCC), at para 25).</p> <p>An issue that still remains unsettled is whether Crown corporations (such as Canada Post) are subject to the Charter. Several lower courts had expressed the view that while some aspects of Canada Post\u2019s operations might be subject to the Charter, the collective bargaining relationship between it and its union was not. A number of decisions have found that the Charter does not apply to the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation.</p> <p>Even if an entity is not part of the apparatus of either the federal or provincial government, because it is not subject to routine or regular ministerial control, it may nevertheless qualify as government for the purposes of s 32 of the Charter if it is exercising governmental functions.</p> <p>Godbout v. Longueuil (City), 1997 CanLII 335 (SCC)</p> <ul> <li>[47] ... [Where] entities other than Parliament, the provincial legislatures or the federal or provincial governments ... are, in reality, \u201cgovernmental\u201d in nature,as evidenced by such things as the degree of government control exercised over them, or by the governmental quality of the functions they perform, they cannot escape Charter scrutiny. ... Indeed, it may be that particular entities will be subject to Charter scrutiny in respect of certain governmental activities they perform, even if the entities themselves cannot accurately be described as \u201cgovernmental\u201d per se.</li> <li>[48] The possibility that the Canadian Charter might apply to entities other than Parliament, the provincial legislatures and the federal or provincial governments is, of course, explicitly contemplated by the language of s. 32(1) inasmuch as entities that are controlled by government or that perform truly governmental functions are themselves \u201cmatters within the authority\u201d of the particular legislative body that created them.</li> <li>[49] In order for the Canadian Charter to apply ... , an entity must truly be acting in what can accurately be described as a \u201cgovernmental\u201d, as opposed to a merely \u201cpublic\u201d, capacity.</li> <li>[50] ... the view that municipalities are subject to the Charter is not only sound, but also wholly consistent with the case law I have been discussing.</li> <li>[55] All the municipality\u2019s powers are derived from statute and all are of a governmental character. An act performed by an entity that is governmental in nature is, to my mind, necessarily \u201cgovernmental\u201d and cannot properly be viewed as \u201cprivate\u201d at all.</li> </ul> <p>In Kahkewistahaw First Nation v Taypotat, 2015 SCC 30, the Supreme Court of Canada assumed that First Nations\u2019 band councils established under the Indian Act were government entities subject to the Charter. The terms of a treaty may also subject the exercise of Indigenous governmental powers to Charter constraints.</p> <p>The application of the Charter to law society rules was assumed without discussion by the Supreme Court in Black v. Law Society of Alberta, 1989 CanLII 132 (SCC).</p> <p>In Blencoe v British Columbia (Human Rights Commission), 2000 SCC 44, the Supreme Court of Canada found that the Ontario Human Rights Commission, although not part of government and not controlled by government, was subject to the Charter because it was a body created by statute to implement a government objective and all of its actions were pursuant to statutory authority.</p> <p>Non-Governmental Entities Implementing Government Programs</p> <p>Eldridge v. British Columbia (Attorney General), 1997 CanLII 327 (SCC)</p> <ul> <li>[19] Whether the Charter applies to those particular entities, like hospitals and the Medical Services Commission, exercising discretion conferred by legislation. In my view, the Charter applies to [them] in so far as they act pursuant to the powers granted to them by the statutes.</li> <li>[20] There are two ways, however, in which it can do so [the Charter applies]. First, legislation may be found to be unconstitutional on its face because it violates a Charter right and is not saved by s. 1. Secondly, the Charter may be infringed, not by the legislation itself, but by the actions of a delegated decision-maker in applying it.</li> <li>[36] There are myriad public or quasi-public institutions that may be independent from government in some respects, but in other respects may exercise delegated governmental powers or be otherwise responsible for the implementation of government policy. ... it must be established that the entity, in performing that particular action, is part of \u201cgovernment\u201d within the meaning of s. 32 of the Charter.</li> <li>[40] ... when an entity is determined to be part of the fabric of government, the Charter will apply to all its activities, including those that might in other circumstances be thought of as \u201cprivate.\u201d </li> <li>[41] ... the Charter may apply to non-governmental entities in certain circumstances ... It has been suggested, for example, that the Charter will apply to a private entity when engaged in activities that can in some way be attributed to government. </li> <li>[42] McKinney makes it clear, however, that the Charter applies to private entities in so far as they act in furtherance of a specific governmental program or policy.</li> <li>[43] Two important points must be made with respect to this principle. First, the mere fact that an entity performs what may loosely be termed a \u201cpublic function,\u201d or the fact that a particular activity may be described as \u201cpublic\u201d in nature, will not be sufficient to bring it within the purview of \u201cgovernment\u201d for the purposes of s. 32 of the Charter. In order for the Charter to apply to a private entity, it must be found to be implementing a specific governmental policy or program.</li> </ul> <p>More recently, the Alberta Court of Appeal in UAlberta Pro-Life v Governors of the University of Alberta, 2020 ABCA 1 (CanLII), held that the university\u2019s regulation of student expression on campus amounted to government action subject to the Charter because the university\u2019s purpose, established by statute, was to educate students and this was achieved \u201clargely by means of free expression\u201d (at para 148).</p>","tags":["LAW 505: Canadian Public Law","Unit 5"]},{"location":"UBC-laws/L505/505Unit5/#53-interpreting-rights-and-defining-limitations","title":"5.3 Interpreting Rights and Defining Limitations","text":"<p>Readings</p> <ul> <li>Constitutional Law: Chapter 17 pp. 735-744 (stop at end of \"3.\")</li> <li>Constitutional Law: Chapter 17 pp. 756-770 (stop at \"C.\")</li> </ul>","tags":["LAW 505: Canadian Public Law","Unit 5"]},{"location":"UBC-laws/L505/505Unit5/#module-content_1","title":"<p>Module Content</p>","text":"<p>Section 1 of the Charter of Rights and Freedoms is as follows:</p> <p>The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.</p> <p>This section creates a two-step process for the adjudication of Charter claims.</p> <ul> <li>First, it is necessary to determine whether a Charter right has been breached by a state act.

The first step is concerned with whether a Charter right has been limited. This second step is concerned with the justification of limits on Charter rights.</p> <p>The courts have adopted a \u201cpurposive\u201d approach to the interpretation of Charter rights.</p> <p>Hunter et al. v. Southam Inc., 1984 CanLII 33 (SCC)</p> <ul> <li>The need for a broad perspective in approaching constitutional documents is a familiar theme in Canadian constitutional jurisprudence. In Edwards v. Canada (Attorney General), 1929 CanLII 438 (UK JCPC):<ul> <li>The British North America Act planted in Canada a living tree capable of growth and expansion within its natural limits. ... to give it a large and liberal interpretation. </li> </ul> </li> <li>The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms is a purposive document. It is intended to constrain governmental action inconsistent with those rights and freedoms; it is not in itself an authorization for governmental action. This leads, in my view, to the further conclusion that an assessment of the constitutionality of a search and seizure, or of a statute author-izing a search or seizure, must focus on its \u201creasonable\u201d or \u201cunreasonable\u201d impact on the subject of the search or the seizure, and not simply on its rationality in furthering some valid government objective. </li> <li>... it is first necessary to specify the purpose underlying s. 8: in other words, to delineate the nature of the interests it is meant to protect.</li> </ul> <p>In R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd., 1985 CanLII 69 (SCC), Dickson CJ (at paras 116-17) reiterated the Court\u2019s commitment to a purposive approach:</p> <p>this Court expressed the view that the proper approach to the definition of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the Charter was a purposive one.</p> <p>In my view this analysis is to be undertaken, and the purpose of the right or freedom in question is to be sought by reference to the character and the larger objects of the Charter itself, to the language chosen to articulate the specific right or freedom, to the historical origins of the concepts enshrined, and where applicable, to the meaning and purpose of the other specific rights and freedoms with which it is associated within the text of the Charter. </p> <p>The two-step structure of adjudication rests on the idea that there are two distinct issues to be addressed, the definition of the right and the justification of limits. The scope of the right is defined in terms of the interests it protects or advances. Any activity that advances the right\u2019s purpose falls within its scope. Other interests that compete or conflict with those that underlie the right may be taken into account under s 1 as possible grounds for limitation. </p> <p>Whether the distinction between these different interests really is so straightforward? particularly if the purposive approach is unable to yield a bright line between activity that advances the purpose (and is protected) and activity that does not.</p> <p>Jamie Cameron points out in the following excerpt of \u201cThe McLachlin Court and the Charter in 2012\u201d (2013) 63 SCLR 16 at 39:</p> <p>... now the deep thinking on rights has been done and is in the past, that balancing rights and limits is a different exercise. The grand pronouncements give way to fine tuning and subtle interpretation. </p> <p>Deference to the legislatures is more standard when issues do not present conflicts in principle but sit, instead, in the margin of appreciation. Presenting differences of opinion that way may mean that reasonable limits will typically prevail over rights protection.</p> <p>AIDS TO INTERPRETATION</p> <ul> <li>Interpretive Provisions in the Charter</li> </ul> <p>The Charter includes several general provisions (ss 25 to 29) that do not entrench a particular right, but instead affirm or highlight certain values that are to be taken into account when interpreting the entrenched rights and assessing the justification of limits under s 1.</p> <ul> <li>Parliamentary and Committee Debates</li> </ul> <p>In Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act, 1985 CanLII 81 (SCC), the Court considered the relevance of the committee and Parliamentary debates that preceded the enactment of the Charter to the interpretation of the entrenched rights:</p> <p>[50] The inherent unreliability of such statements and speeches is not altered by the mere fact that they pertain to the Charter rather than a statute. </p> <p>[52] In view of the indeterminate nature of the data, it would in my view be erroneous to give these materials anything but minimal weight. </p> <p>To sum up, though they are admissible, debates or legislative history have limited weight in Charter interpretation. </p> <ul> <li>Canadian Pre-Charter Jurisprudence </li> </ul> <p>In several early Charter judgments, the Supreme Court of Canada signalled that decisions under the Canadian Bill of Rights had only limited relevance in Charter cases.</p> <p>The Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s first comprehensive treatment of the meaning of s 1 came in R v Oakes, which remains the primary referent for this second stage of Charter adjudication.</p> <p>R. v. Oakes, 1986 CanLII 46 (SCC)</p> <ul> <li>Section 8 of the Narcotic Control Act, RSC 1970, c N-1 created a \u201crebuttable presumption\u201d that once the fact of possession of a narcotic had been proven, an intention to traffic would be inferred unless the accused established the absence of such an intention. In Oakes, the accused challenged this \u201creverse onus\u201d provision, arguing that it violated s 11(d) of the Charter. After finding that s 8 did violate s 11(d), the Court went on to discuss whether the limit could nonetheless be upheld under s 1.</li> <li>s. 1 has two functions: first, it constitutionally guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in the provisions which follow; and, second, it states explicitly the exclusive justificatory criteria (outside of s. 33 of the Constitution Act, 1982) against which limitations on those rights and freedoms must be measured.</li> <li>The Court must be guided by the values and principles essential to a free and democratic society which I believe embody, to name but a few, respect for the inherent dignity of the human person, commitment to social justice and equality, accommodation of a wide variety of beliefs, respect for cultural and group identity, and faith in social and political institutions which enhance the participation of individuals and groups in society.</li> <li>It may become necessary to limit rights and freedoms in circumstances where their exercise would be inimical to the realization of collective goals of fundamental importance. s. 1 provides criteria of a stringent standard of justification, especially when understood in terms of the two contextual considerations discussed above, namely, the violation of a constitutionally guaranteed right or freedom and the fundamental principles of a free and democratic society. </li> <li>The onus of proving that a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the Charter is reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society rests upon the party seeking to uphold the limitation.</li> <li>The standard of proof under s. 1 is the civil standard, namely, proof by a prepon-derance of probability. The alternative criminal standard, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, would, in my view, be unduly onerous on the party seeking to limit.</li> <li>To establish that a limit is reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society, two central criteria must be satisfied. <ul> <li>First, the objective, which the measures responsible for a limit on a Charter right or freedom are designed to serve, must be \u201cof sufficient importance to warrant overriding a constitutionally protected right or freedom\u201d. It is necessary, at a minimum, that an objective relate to concerns which are pressing and substantial in a free and democratic society before it can be characterized as sufficiently important. </li> <li>Second, the party invoking s. 1 must show that the means chosen are reasonable and demonstrably justified. This involves \u201ca form of proportionality test\u201d.</li> </ul> </li> <li>There are three important components of a proportionality test. <ul> <li>First, the measures adopted must be carefully designed to achieve the objective in question. They must not be arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational considerations. In short, they must be rationally connected to the objective. </li> <li>Second, the means should impair \u201cas little as possible\u201d the right or freedom in question.</li> <li>Third, there must be a proportionality between the effects of the measures which are responsible for limiting the Charter right or freedom, and the objective which has been identified as of \u201csufficient importance.\u201d </li> </ul> </li> <li>With respect to the third component (proportionality), the inquiry into effects must, however, go further. Some limits on rights and freedoms protected by the Charter will be more serious than others. ... it is still possible that, because of the severity of the deleterious effects of a measure on individuals or groups, the measure will not be justified by the purposes it is intended to serve. The more severe the deleterious effects of a measure, the more important the objective must be if the measure is to be reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.</li> </ul> <p>The rational connection and minimal impairment tests are closely related. A law that does not rationally advance the pressing and substantial purpose for which it was enacted can be described as unnecessarily restricting the right or freedom. Similarly, a law that restricts the right or freedom more than is necessary to advance its pressing purpose (that does not minimally impair the freedom) can be described as partially ineffective or irrational.</p> <p>In RJR-MacDonald Inc v Canada (AG), 1995 CanLII 64(SCC), the Court found that when Parliament\u2019s preferred approach falls \u201cwithin a range of reasonable alternatives,\u201d the minimal impairment test will be satisfied. But if the Court can identify \u201cequally effective\u201d and less intrusive means to achieve the objective, it will rule that the law does not minimally impair the rights or freedoms at stake (at para 160).</p> <p>The Final Balance. This last component of the Oakes test, which is referred to as the \u201cdeleterious effects\u201d test or the \u201cdisproportionate effects\u201d test, requires a proportionality between the effects of the measures that are responsible for limiting the Charter right or freedom, and the objective that has been identified as of \u201csufficient importance.\u201d</p> <p>In Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp., 1994 CanLII 39 (SCC), the Court added a refinement or clarification to the third part of the Oakes proportionality test.  The Dagenais refinement requires that in applying this test, courts consider not only the objective of the impugned law but also its salutary effects.</p> <p>I believe that the third step of the second branch of the Oakes test requires both that the underlying objective of a measure and the salutary effects that actually result from its implementation be proportional to the deleterious effects the measure has on fundamental rights and freedoms.</p> <p>Nonetheless, even if the importance of the objective itself (when viewed in the abstract) outweighs the deleterious effects on protected rights, it is still possible that the actual salutary effects of the legislation will not be sufficient to justify these negative effects.</p> <p>The Subsequent Development of the Oakes Test: Context and Deference</p> <p>Two important and closely related developments since the introduction of the Oakes test. </p> <ul> <li>The first is the emergence of the contextual approach to the assessment of limits under s 1. This approach requires that courts assess the value or significance of the right and its restriction in their context rather than in the abstract. <ul> <li>certain forms of expression such as hate promotion are less valuable, than other forms of expression, and that this lesser value is a relevant contextual factor in the balancing of interests under s 1.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The second trend is the Court\u2019s willingness to defer in certain circumstances to the legislature\u2019s judgment about the need for, and effectiveness of, a particular limit on a Charter right.</li> </ul> <p>The origins of the \u201ccontextual\u201d approach to s 1 lie in Edmonton Journal v Alberta (AG), immediately below.</p> <p>Edmonton Journal v.

This is where delegation of law-making powers comes into play. The federal government in Ottawa, along with provincial and territorial governments, delegate a large number of law-making, administration and implementation powers to administrative agencies.

Examples include the types of evidence a tribunal may receive, the amount of notice that must be given to a participant in a hearing, the right to represent themselves in a hearing or the right to counsel, etc. However, as with jurisdictional issues, in some cases an enabling statute does not clearly specify decision-making procedures.

Administrative discretion was to be strictly limited through narrow interpretation of enabling statutes, resulting in close judicial scrutiny of administrative decisions to ensure they remained with statutory limits.</li> <li>The Supreme Court has embraced the Dyzenhaus concept of deference, focusing on the reasons of an administrative decision as the focal point of its analysis.

The reason these instruments are called \"subordinate legislation\" is because although they are made by the Governor-in-Council, they are subordinate to (and limited by) Parliament. Provincial orders-in-council, orders of the lieutenant-governor-in-councils, function similarly to federal ones.</p> <p>Some of the most common forms of delegated legislation at the federal level in Canada involve orders (regulations) made by the Governor in Council. This is called an Order-in-Council. Although it is issued by the executive (i.e. the Governor-General) it is a legislative instrument. These types of orders require a statute (legislation) from Parliament conferring the authority.</p> <p>Orders In Council - Search</p> <p>Although Courts may involve themselves in limiting administrative decision-making, they are often reluctant to interfere in this area for a number of reasons. The most vivid illustration of Canadian courts' reluctance to intervene in a substantive ultra vires assessment of delegated legislation remains Thorne's Hardware Ltd. v. The Queen.</p> <p>Samantha's Comment</p> <p>In Thorne's Hardware, the court was reviewing an Order in Council that extended the port boundaries.  Thorne's argued that the expansion was beyond the powers of the Governor in Council because it was passed for improper motives.</p> <p>The court notes at the outset that just because a statutory power is vested in the Governor in Council doesn't mean that it's beyond judicial review.  However, the court seems to limit itself to reviewing issues of law and jurisdiction.  For example, whether the Governor in Council had the proper legal authority to do what they did.</p> <p>Here, Cabinet had statutory authority to determine the harbour boundaries - this authority is written right into the National Harbour Board Act.  The court was unwilling to consider Cabinet's motives - they said that wasn't their job.  Governments don't publish the reasons for their decisions. \"The issue of harbour extension was one of economic policy and politics; and not one of jurisdiction and jurisprudence.\"</p> <p>In summary then, we have the Roncarelli court which DID consider what the motives were behind the decision and then whether that motive/purpose was within the scope of the authority provided by statute.  We then have the Thorne court that assessed whether the decision was within the scope of statutory authority WITHOUT considering the reasoning behind the decision (although they do seem to keep the possibility open in cases of \"egregious\" or \"compelling grounds\").  What this latter decision shows is that when it comes to \"delegated legislation\" (an Order in Council), the judiciary is much more reluctant to interfere.</p>","tags":["Administrative Law","LAW_V 509 99A 2025W1","Unit 3"]},{"location":"UBC-laws/L509/509Unit3/#33-introduction-to-tribunal-remedies","title":"3.3 Introduction to Tribunal Remedies","text":"<p>Historically, most administrative law remedies in common law jurisdictions involved the common law remedy of prerogative writs.

The limitations relating to the duty of fairness includes these two broad categories:</p> <p>Legislative functions exclusion</p> <p>The stricter requirements of procedural fairness don\u2019t apply to legislatures exercising their legislative functions.</p> <p>The making of subordinate legislation is not subject to procedural fairness.</p> <p>However, the administrative bodies they create are, generally, subject to requirements of procedural fairness. When dealing with vague statutes and subordinate legislation, the common law will impose procedural fairness requirements on final decision-making where the rights, privileges and interests of individuals are at stake.</p> <p>Keep in mind the contrast between actions or decisions that are \u201cadministrative and specific\u201d (subject to duty of fairness) and those which are \u201clegislative and general\u201d (not subject to duty of fairness).</p> <p>Cabinet and broad policy decisions</p> <p>In the wake of Nicholson, in this case the Supreme Court of Canada addressed the question of whether there were now no limits to the reach of procedural fairness obligations. The Court stated that the threshold had been lowered - not eliminated.</p> <p>In Inuit Tapirisat, the Court\u2019s threshold inquiry prevented the application of procedural fairness obligations to the Governor in Council in hearing an appeal from a CRTC decision on a Bell Canada rate application. The Court described hearing a Cabinet appeal as involving \"legislative action in its purest form.\"</p> <p>What about by-laws? The Homex case dealt with the question of applying by-laws and whether a duty of fairness applied in the particular circumstances. One critical point in the decision is the Court\u2019s analysis and characterization of the decision. In Homex, the Court stated that a by-law, on broad grounds of public policy, will typically afford the individual little or no procedural protection.</p> <p>Key points to remember</p> <p>First, it\u2019s clear that the Supreme Court has emphasized that not all administrative decisions are under a duty to act fairly. The finality of a decision will be a factor to consider. A decision of a preliminary nature will not in general trigger the duty to act fairly, whereas a decision of a more final nature may have such an effect.</p> <p>Canadian courts will not see any obligation of procedural fairness arising in the context of legislative action. Legislative functions obviously involves the making of both primary and subordinate legislation.</p> <p>One of the exceptions involves subordinate legislation directed at a specific individual and that has the effect of resolving an ongoing dispute (as seen in Homex).</p> <p>As seen in Inuit Tapirisat, duty of fairness will not apply in regard to broad, policy-based decision-making affecting a range of constituencies, and will also have little or no application in the domain of ministerial decisions taken by reference to broad policy considerations.</p> <p>Take a look at the example below which uses local government decisions concerning zoning and planning to illustrate the differences between legislative decisions and administrative (including quasi-judicial and judicial) decisions. Notice that the legislative decisions tend to involve general or policy decisions while the administrative ones could involve individuals or specific targets.</p> <p></p> <p>Att. Gen. of Can. v.

Lord Hailsham [ [1972] 1 W.L.R. 1973.] at p. 1378:<ul> <li>Let me accept that in the sphere of the so-called quasi-judicial the rules of natural justice run, and that in the administrative or executive field there is a general duty of fairness.

Legislatures are subject to constitutional requirements for valid law-making, but within their constitutional boundaries, they can do as they see fit.  The wisdom and value of legislative decisions are subject only to review by the electorate.  The judgment in Reference re Canada Assistance Plan, supra, at p. 558, was conclusive on this point in stating that: \u201cthe rules governing procedural fairness do not apply to a body exercising purely legislative functions\u201d.</li> <li>[60] In Reference re Amendment of Constitution of Canada, [1981] 1 S.C.R. 753, it was stated at p. 785:<ul> <li>...

Wyoming, 1980 CanLII 55 (SCC)</p> <ul> <li>...   wherever a statute authorizes the interference with property or other rights and is silent as to whether or not the agency in question is required to give notice prior to the intervention in such rights, the courts will \"supply the omission of the legislature\" and require the agency in question to afford the subject an opportunity of being heard before it proceeds: Cooper v. Wandsworth Board of Works [(1863), 14 C.B.(N.S.) 180]</li> <li>There are instances where the omission of the prerequisite notice is not supplied by the courts, as, for example, where the statute in question, by its very nature and by the legislative framework there adopted by the Legislature, must be read as precluding the requirement of prior notice.</li> <li>the action taken by the Council was not in substance legislative but rather quasi-judicial in character so as to attract the principle of notice and the consequential doctrine of audi alteram partem, as laid down by the courts as long ago as in Wandsworth, supra. ...

The duty of fairness that it creates also supplement common law conceptions independence and lack of bias in decision-making.</p> <p>It\u2019s important to note that the procedural representations made by a public authority must be made accurately because they may be relied upon by an individual who may be prejudiced in certain situations. </p> <p>Legitimate expectations doctrine only creates rights to be heard and make representations or be consulted where an individual has been prejudiced through relying on a representor\u2019s (usually government or public authority) representations or submissions. </p> <p>The legitimate expectations doctrine originated in England.  The Lord Denning ruling in Schmidt v. Secretary of State for Home Affairs, [1969] 2 Ch. 149 (Eng. C.A.), stated that the legitimate expectations doctrine originated in England as a threshold mechanism for establishing entitlement to procedural fairness. This doctrine has evolved to define the content of duty of fairness in cases where, by representation or past practice, administrative decision-makers had led affected individuals to expect specific procedural safeguards.</p> <p>In Canadian law, the legitimate expectations doctrine is part of the duty of procedural fairness.  It is meant to ensure actions of public authorities in dealing with the public are predictable, treat individuals fairly and are free from arbitrary decisions.</p> <p>Agraira v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2013 SCC 36</p> <ul> <li>[93] As this Court noted in Dunsmuir, at para. 79, \u201c[p]rocedural fairness is a cornerstone of modern Canadian administrative law.  Public decision makers are required to act fairly in coming to decisions that affect the rights, privileges or interests of an individual.\u201d  </li> <li>[94] Legitimate expectations doctrine was given a strong foundation in Canadian administrative law in Baker, in which it was held to be a factor to be applied in determining what is required by the common law duty of fairness.  <ul> <li>If a public authority has made representations about the procedure it will follow in making a particular decision, or if it has consistently adhered to certain procedural practices in the past in making such a decision, the scope of the duty of procedural fairness owed to the affected person will be broader than it otherwise would have been.  </li> <li>Likewise, if representations with respect to a substantive result have been made to an individual, the duty owed to him by the public authority in terms of the procedures it must follow before making a contrary decision will be more onerous.</li> </ul> </li> <li>[95]The specific conditions which must be satisfied in order for the doctrine of legitimate expectations to apply are summarized succinctly in a leading authority entitled Judicial Review of Administrative Action in Canada:<ul> <li>Thus, a legitimate expectation may result from an official practice or assurance that certain procedures will be followed as part of the decision-making process, or that a positive decision can be anticipated.  ... Of course, the practice or conduct said to give rise to the reasonable expectation must be clear, unambiguous and unqualified.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>[96] In Mavi, Binnie J. recently explained what is meant by \u201cclear, unambiguous and unqualified\u201d representations by drawing an analogy with the law of contract (at para. 69):<ul> <li>Generally speaking, government representations will be considered sufficiently precise for purposes of the doctrine of legitimate expectations if, had they been made in the context of a private law contract, they would be sufficiently certain to be capable of enforcement.</li> </ul> </li> <li>[97]  An important limit on the doctrine of legitimate expectations is that it cannot give rise to substantive rights (Baker, at para. 26; Reference re Canada Assistance Plan (B.C.), 1991 CanLII 74 (SCC), [1991] 2 S.C.R. 525, at p. 557).  In other words, \u201c[w]here the conditions for its application are satisfied, the Court may [only] grant appropriate procedural remedies to respond to the \u2018legitimate\u2019 expectation\u201d.</li> </ul> <p>Canada (Attorney General) v. Mavi, 2011 SCC 30</p> <ul> <li>[38] \u201c... there is, as a general common law principle, a duty of procedural fairness lying on every public authority making an administrative decision which is not of a legislative nature and which affects the rights, privileges or interests of an individual\u201d: Cardinal v. Director of Kent Institution, [1985] 2 S.C.R. 643, at p. 653.</li> <li>[40] In determining the content of procedural fairness a balance must be struck.  Administering a \u201cfair\u201d process inevitably slows matters down and costs the taxpayer money.  On the other hand, the public also suffers a cost if government is perceived to act unfairly, or administrative action is based on \u201cerroneous, incomplete or ill-considered findings of fact, conclusions of law, or exercises of discretion.\u201d</li> <li>[42] A number of factors help to determine the content of procedural fairness in a particular legislative and administrative context. ... The duty of fairness is not a \u201cone-size-fits-all\u201d doctrine.  Some of the elements to be considered were set out in a non-exhaustive list in Baker (Baker Factors).</li> <li>[43] Here, as in Knight, the absence of other remedies militates in favour of a duty of fairness at the time of the enforcement decision (see also Baker, at para. 24).  </li> <li>[68] Where a government official makes representations within the scope of his or her authority to an individual about an administrative process that the government will follow, and the representations said to give rise to the legitimate expectations are clear, unambiguous and unqualified, the government may be held to its word, provided the representations are procedural in nature and do not conflict with the decision maker\u2019s statutory duty.  Proof of reliance is not a requisite. </li> <li>[69] Generally speaking, government representations will be considered sufficiently precise for purposes of the doctrine of legitimate expectations if, had they been made in the context of a private law contract, they would be sufficiently certain to be capable of enforcement.</li> </ul>","tags":["Administrative Law","LAW_V 509 99A 2025W1","Unit 4"]},{"location":"UBC-laws/L509/509Unit4/#46-judicial-review-and-breach-of-duty-fairness","title":"4.6 Judicial Review and Breach of Duty Fairness","text":"<p>Readings</p> <ul> <li>Cardinal v.

Garfield Container Transport Inc., 2006 FC 785</li> </ul> <p>The concept of \u201cfairness\u201d in this area is broken into several components in the textbook. In this Module, we focus on three issues relating to access to administrative justice.</p> <p>1. Standing</p> <p>In Canadian administrative law, standing or locus standi refers to the ability of someone challenging an administrative decision to prove to the court sufficient connection and harm from the administrative decision that would support that party's participation in the case.</p> <p>The issue of standing doesn\u2019t arise in most judicial review cases since the individual challenging the decision is usually the main target of the decision. Further, in Canada standing to challenge administrative decisions is generally governed by the terms of an enabling statute, which can be narrow or broad.</p> <p>Public interest standing in Canada is available in Constitutional and non-Constitutional cases. We are focusing in this topic on non-Constitutional cases. Standing issues can arise through common-law and statutory challenges in two broad ways:</p> <ul> <li>(1) An administrative decision may affect a large section of the public without specifically targeting a single individual; and</li> <li>(2) An administrative decision may affect broad interests in unique ways and someone other than a targeted individual applies for judicial review.</li> </ul> <p>Finlay is the Supreme Court of Canada case that extended the domain of public interest standing from a constitutional to a general administrative law basis.</p> <p>In Finlay, the Supreme Court of Canada adopted the reasoning in its previous decision Thorson v. Attorney General of Canada, 1974 CanLII 6 (SCC) to justify the recognition of public interest standing in purely administrative law cases. The SCC held that courts should have discretion to recognize the standing of a public interest litigant.</p> <p>The main considerations in analyzing this are:</p> <ul> <li>(a) whether or not there is a justiciable issue, reflecting \"concern about the proper role of the courts and their constitutional relationship with the other branches of government.\"</li> <li>(b) whether or not the challenge involves a serious issue raised by someone with a \"genuine\" interest in its determination, reflecting a \"concern about the allocation of scarce judicial resources and the need to screen out the mere busybody.\"</li> <li>(c) whether or not there is any other \"reasonable and effective manner in which the issue may be brought before a court\", reflecting the concern that the \"courts should have the benefit of the contending points of view by those most directly affected by them.\"</li> </ul> <p>2. Communication (Language)</p> <p>There are constitutional guarantees for availability of language interpretation for certain areas of law, under Section 14 of the Charter (such as in criminal cases), however in the administrative law context, the situation is quite different. Courts often defer to administrative tribunals and their discretion in determining the availability of translation services and information availability in different languages.</p> <p>The case excerpt of Filgueira deals with the issue of language and accessibility relating to information about administrative decision-making services. It also touches on some difficult issues such as the financial implications and responsibility for who pays for the production of language translation services and related information.</p> <p>3. Financial Costs</p> <p>Too much emphasis on procedures can compromise other values that are important in delivering government services and programs. There is the possibility of delaying important government decisions that might prejudice the public interest. In addition, administrative process such as holding hearings can cost more money to both the administrative agency and participants. The inherent delays in some hearings may render the ultimate outcome more costly.</p> <p>The financial stresses put on individual claimants during an administrative law process is a growing concern for the Canadian legal community. One of the responses, at the provincial level, has been for greater power and discretion afforded to administrative tribunals to develop their own costs schemes.</p> <p>As the text notes at p. 366, s. 47(1) of the B.C. Administrative Tribunals Act allows for B.C. administrative tribunals to develop their own cost schemes. Note that while s. 47(1) says \u201cSubject to the regulations\u201d no such regulations have been enacted.</p> <p>The decision of the BC Farm Industry Review Board in B.C. Vegetable Greenhouse v BC Vegetable Marketing Commission considers with this complex issue. As you read the decision, note the Review Board\u2019s consideration that administrative tribunals have no inherent power to award costs, and that the power to award costs must be found either expressly or by implication in a tribunal\u2019s enabling statute.</p>","tags":["Administrative Law","LAW_V 509 99A 2025W1","Unit 5"]},{"location":"UBC-laws/L509/509Unit5/#chapter-16-fairness-in-context-achieving-fairness-through-access-to-administrative-justice","title":"Chapter 16 FAIRNESS IN CONTEXT: ACHIEVING FAIRNESS THROUGH ACCESS TO ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE","text":"<p>We approach our topic from three overarching perspectives:</p> <ul> <li>Access to the tribunal</li> <li>Access to legal or other knowledge necessary to obtain tribunal services</li> <li>Access to resources needed to navigate tribunal system</li> </ul> <p>ACCESS TO ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE: THE TRIBUNAL</p> <p>In Baker the Supreme Court of Canada noted that the bedrock underlying virtually all questions of fairness in administrative procedures is the requirement that administrative decisions are made using procedures appropriate to the decision-making context, with an opportunity for those affected by the decision to put forward their views and evidence fully and have them considered by the decision-maker.</p> <p>A. STANDING</p> <p>Tribunals, unlike courts, have no inherent jurisdiction. The standing to bring a matter to a tribunal must be found in the tribunal\u2019s governing statute (or some other statutory authority).</p> <p>The enabling statute sets the parameters for access, but it also provides a measure of discretion to the Board to determine both who is directly affected by its proceedings and what amounts to an adequate opportunity to be heard.</p> <p>In Delta Air Lines Inc. v. Luk\u00e1cs, 2018 SCC 2, Dr G\u00e1bor Luk\u00e1cs filed a complaint with the Canadian Transportation Agency alleging that Delta Air Lines discriminated in its approach to seating and accommodating obese persons. Dr Luk\u00e1cs did not bring the complaint on his own behalf but as a public interest litigant.</p> <p>A majority of the Supreme Court found that, in dismissing Dr Luk\u00e1cs\u2019 complaint in this man-ner, the Agency unreasonably interpreted both the jurisprudence on public interest standing and the broad remedial authority afforded to it under its enabling legislation.</p> <p>Under the historical regime of prerogative writs, standing was limited to those directly affected by state action.</p> <p>Judicial review of administrative action is generally reserved for those who are found to have a sufficient legally recognized interest in the matter to justify the judicial review application. It is said that the test for standing is whether the applicant is a \u201cperson aggrieved\u201d by the administrative decision. It has been said that a person aggrieved is one who will suffer some \u201cpeculiar grievance of their own beyond some grievance suffered by them in common with the rest of the public.\u201d</p> <p>The general policy of the court is not to decide issues in the absence of the parties whose rights are most directly affected by the court\u2019s decision.</p> <p>One of the most significant developments in Canadian public law is the concept of discretionary public interest standing, which may allow a \u201ctest\u201d applicant or non-governmental organization to launch judicial review proceedings on behalf of a broader group.</p> <p>Where the vulnerability of a disadvantaged group prevents members of that group from accessing the courts, it may be appropriate for public interest organizations to step forward. This was the situation in the leading case on public interest standing, Canada (Attorney General) v. Downtown Eastside Sex Workers United Against Violence Society, 2012 SCC 45.</p> <p>the Supreme Court of Canada indicated that a liberal approach to the issue of public interest standing may frequently best serve the interests of justice. The Downtown Eastside case affirmed the test for determining standing that had previously been established in the jurisprudence, but underscored that the discretion to grant public interest standing should be exercised in a broad, generous, and liberal manner.</p> <p>The test for public interest standing remains threefold:</p> <ol> <li>Is the matter serious and justiciable?</li> <li>Is the party seeking standing genuinely interested in the matter?</li> <li>Is there any other reasonable and effective way for the matter to be adjudicated?</li> </ol> <p>In previous cases, the 3rd factor had been viewed as a strict requirement that the party seeking standing had to establish that there was essentially no other reasonable and effective manner in which the issue could be brought before the courts. The Supreme Court of Canada, however, concluded that the 3rd factor would be better expressed as requiring that the proposed proceeding be, in light of various pragmatic considerations, a reasonable and effective means of bringing the case to court.</p> <p>Writing for the Court, Cromwell J articulated:</p> <p>The court should consider whether the case is of public interest in the sense that it transcends the interests of those most directly affected by the challenged law or action.</p> <p>The tension between fairness and efficiency is an enduring theme in settings of access to administrative justice. On the one hand, expanding the scope of those entitled to participate in judicial review processes may be resisted on the basis that the increased complexity and evidentiary burden this places on the courts belies the very purpose of administrative efficiency and judicial review. On the other hand, any substantive understanding of fairness reveals that vulnerable populations may frequently be both unable and unwilling to shoulder the heavy burden of challenging laws that may very well infringe important, constitutionally protected rights. </p> <p>B. HEARINGS</p> <p>Full oral hearings are not required in all administrative law contexts; rather, the specific format of proceedings that tribunals incorporate into their decision-making processes, and the discretion available to tribunals to control their processes, will normally be set out in empowering statutes.</p> <p>ACCESS TO ADMINISTRATIVE JUSTICE: INFORMATION AND KNOWLEDGE</p> <p>A. GUIDELINES</p> <p>While transparency calls for tribunals to develop and publicize guidelines on which parties may rely, the principles of administrative law may limit the effectiveness of that reliance by requiring that a tribunal not treat its own guidelines as binding.</p> <p>While guidelines may not be binding, they frequently represent a distillation, simplification, and operationalization of existing case law and legal principles. So, decision-makers who stray from them may be found to have committed legal errors in having done so.</p> <p>Supreme Court in Vavilov noted that \u201cwhere a decision maker does depart from longstanding practices or established internal authority, it bears the justificatory burden of explaining that departure in its reasons.\"</p> <p>B. SIMPLIFICATION</p> <p>C. LANGUAGE</p> <p>Since R. v. Tran, 1994 CanLII 56 (SCC), the Supreme Court of Canada has adopted a contextual approach to s. 14 of the Charter, which provides, \u201cA party or witness in any proceedings who does not understand or speak the language in which the proceedings are conducted or who is deaf has the right to the assistance of an interpreter.\"</p> <p>In Tran, the Court makes it clear that not every error of translation or interpretation provided to an accused individual will constitute a violation of the Charter. Further, the Court holds that the error must be one that goes to the \u201cvital interests\u201d of the accused and, therefore, even a serious problem with translation on a minor point (e.g., a scheduling motion) will not constitute a violation.</p> <p>The right to an interpreter (and, by extension, to translation of relevant material) in the administrative context was considered in Filgueira v. Garfield Container Transport Inc., 2006 FC 785.</p> <p>D. PRIOR DECISIONS</p> <p>In most cases, making available a tribunal\u2019s past decisions is seen as a key aspect of its public interest function. Absent circumstances justifying confidentiality, all tribunal proceedings should be open to the public, and documents used in those proceedings should be available to the public.</p> <p>Unlike a court, tribunals are not bound by their earlier decisions. Many tribunals in practice, however, aim for consistency and will treat previous decisions as strongly influential over similar disputes.</p> <p>ACCESS TO RESOURCES NEEDED TO NAVIGATE THE TRIBUNAL SYSTEM</p> <p>Three potential barriers: legal representation, fees and costs, and the budgeting and staffing of tribunals.</p> <p>A. LEGAL REPRESENTATION</p> <p>In the criminal justice sphere, a right to state-funded legal representation has been long recognized. In New Brunswick (Minister of Health and Community Services) v. G. (J.), 1999 CanLII 653 (SCC), the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed that the constitutional right to legal assistance extends beyond the correctional context.</p> <p>It is important to recognize that the right to counsel is not the same as the right to state-funded counsel.</p> <p>In R. v. G.D.B., 2000 SCC 22 the Supreme Court of Canada endorsed the view that where counsel fails to provide effective representation, the legitimacy of an ensuing decision,in both outcome and process, is compromised and may result in a miscarriage of justice.</p> <p>Generally, however, the courts have concluded that the incompetence of counsel will only constitute a breach of natural justice in \u201cextraordinary circumstances\u201d in Memari v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2010 FC 1196.</p> <p>However, it is also important to recognize that access to legal representation is not the norm in many administrative law contexts and that fair procedures will not always depend on such access.</p> <p>B. LAW, TECHNOLOGY, AND ACCESS</p> <p>C. FEES AND COSTS</p> <p>Where a tribunal is deciding a dispute between two or more parties, should the winning parties be able to claim costs against the losing parties as in civil courts?</p> <p>In Canada (Canadian Human Rights Commission) v. Canada (Attorney General), 2011 SCC 53, the Supreme Court of Canada held that no reasonable interpretation of the relevant statutory provisions could support the view that the Tribunal had the authority to award legal costs in matters that come before it. As such, it would appear that a tribunal will generally only have the authority to award costs where such authority is explicitly set out in its enabling legislation.</p> <p>D. BUDGET AND STAFFING</p> <p>While the government may not be under a legal obligation to create tribunals, once it has chosen to do so, it may well be under a legal obligation to provide adequate funding to ensure fairness, the rule of law, and access to justice before these tribunals.</p> <p>In rejecting the government\u2019s warning that requiring oral hearings for all refugee claims would be costly, Wilson J stated in Singh v. Minister of Employment and Immigration, 1985 CanLII 65 (SCC):</p> <p>No doubt considerable time and money can be saved by adopting administrative procedures which ignore the principles of fundamental justice but such an argument, in my view, misses the point of the exercise under s 1 [of the Charter].</p> <p>CONCLUSION</p> <p>Accessibility requires resources, and given the high volume of some tribunals, the resource implications may be quite substantial.</p> <p>In addition to resources, a robust approach to fairness may also depend on how a tribunal accommodates unequal power and resources between parties.</p> <p>Access also involves the balance between fairness and efficiency.</p> <p>Access to administrative justice includes not just standing, guidelines, fees, and representation, but also extends to whether decisions are well reasoned and delivered in a timely fashion.</p> <p>Finlay v. Canada (Minister of Finance), 1986 CanLII 6</p> <ul> <li>Legal issues: <ul> <li>Does the respondent have a sufficient personal interest in the legality of the federal cost-sharing payments to bring him within the general requirement for standing to challenge an exercise of statutory authority by an action for a declaration or an injunction?<ul> <li>I am on balance of the view that the relationship between the prejudice allegedly caused to the respondent by the provincial non-compliance with the conditions and undertakings imposed by the Plan and the alleged illegality of the federal payments is too indirect, remote or speculative to be a sufficient causative relationship for standing under the general rule.</li> </ul> </li> <li>If not, does the Court have a discretion to recognize public interest standing in the circumstances of the present case?</li> </ul> </li> <li>Only the Attorney General has traditionally been regarded as having standing to assert a purely public right or interest by the institution of proceedings for declaratory or injunctive relief of his  own motion or on the relation of another person. His exercise of discretion as to whether or not to give his consent to relator proceedings is not reviewable by the courts. In such a case a private individual may not sue for declaratory or injunctive relief without the consent of the Attorney General unless he can show what amounts to a sufficient private or personal interest in the subject matter of the proceedings.</li> <li>Buckley J. in Boyce v. Paddington Borough Council, [1903] 1 Ch. 109 stated the rule as follows at p. 114:<ul> <li>A plaintiff can sue without joining the Attorney General in two cases: first, where the interference with the public right is such that some private right of his is at the same time interfered with; and, secondly, where no private right is interfered with, but the plaintiff, in respect of his public right, suffers special damage peculiar to himself from the interference with the public right.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The \"private right\" referred to by Buckley J. has been said to be \"a right the invasion of which gives rise to an actionable wrong within the categories of private law, for example, a breach of contract or trust or the commission of a tort\".</li> <li>The nature of the interest reflected by the words \"special damage peculiar to himself\" in the second exception in Boyce has been variously characterized in the cases. in Thorson v. Attorney General of Canada, 1974 CanLII 6 (SCC), Duff J. referred to the general rule as follows at p. 337: \"An individual, for example, has no status to maintain an action restraining a wrongful violation of a public right unless he is exceptionally prejudiced by the wrongful act.\" Schroeder J.A. said in Cowan v. Canadian Broadcasting Corporation, 1966 CanLII 225 (ON CA) at p. 311: \"A plaintiff, in attempting to restrain, control or confine within proper limits, the act of a public or quasi-public body which affects the public generally, is an outsider unless he has sustained special damage or can show that he has some \"special interest, private interest, or sufficient interest\". </li> <li>However, the expression \"special damage peculiar to himself\", in my opinion should be regarded as equivalent in meaning to \"have a special interest in the subject matter of the action\".</li> <li>I am of the opinion, however, that a similar requirement of directness or causal relationship between the alleged prejudice or grievance and the challenged action is implicit in the notions of interference with private right and special damage.</li> <li>After rejecting the standing on private right or peculiar damage grounds, the second question is: <ul> <li>Does the approach to public interest standing in those cases, Thorson, Nova Scotia Board of Censors v. McNeil, 1975 CanLII 14 (SCC) and Minister of Justice (Can.) v. Borowski, 1981 CanLII 34 (SCC), apply to a non-constitutional challenge to the statutory authority for administrative action?</li> </ul> </li> <li>Thurlow C.J. expressed his conclusion in the following passages of his reasons for judgment in MacIlReith v. Hart, 1908 CanLII 64 (SCC) at pp.  527-28<ul> <li>In such circumstances one may wonder why the law should prevent a person who is one of the class of intended beneficiaries of the Canada Assistance Plan and who alleges that he is not getting the standard of assistance it intends because Manitoba does not provide it, from bringing an action to have the issue of the legality of payments to Manitoba under the Act resolved.</li> </ul> </li> <li>In Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General), 1989 CanLII 123 (SCC), Martland J., summed up what Thorson and McNeil stood for as follows at p. 598:<ul> <li>I interpret these cases as deciding that to establish status as a plaintiff in a suit seeking a declaration that legislation is invalid, if there is a serious issue as to its invalidity, a person need only to show that he is affected by it directly or that he has a genuine interest as a citizen in the validity of the legislation and that there is no other reasonable and effective manner in which the issue may be brought before the Court.</li> </ul> </li> <li>I take that to be an indication that the Court was not purporting in Thorson, McNeil and Borowski to lay down a rule or principle respecting public interest standing that extended beyond a challenge to the constitutionality of legislation. ... however, that they do not clearly exclude such recognition.</li> <li>In my view an affirmative answer should be given to this question. For the reasons indicated in Thorson, I do not think that Attorney General's refusal to act in such a case should bar a court from the recognition, as a matter of discretion in accordance with the criteria affirmed in Borowski, of public interest standing in a private individual to institute proceedings. </li> <li>If the respondent is recognized as having standing to seek the declaratory relief then I cannot see why he should not be recognized as also having standing to seek the ancillary injunctive relief. Whether a plaintiff should be granted either declaratory relief or injunctive relief in a particular case is a matter of judicial discretion to be exercised according to criteria and considerations which are somewhat different for the two forms of relief. </li> </ul> <p>Filgueira v. Garfield Container Transport Inc., 2006 FC 785</p> <ul> <li>[36] Thus the right to an interpreter, even in a criminal law context, is not absolute. Courts should be generous and open-minded on the topic. There appears to be greater concern where the situation involves the giving of evidence and understanding the proceedings.</li> <li>[38] It is within the discretion of the Tribunal to determine whether such an objective (the removal of discrimination) can be fairly achieved in the absence of providing, in whole or during part of the process, translation services into a language other than an official language, at taxpayer's expense, to one or more of the parties.</li> </ul> <p>5.1 Discussion Activity: Finlay</p> <p>Read the following case comment on Finlay:</p> <p>Margot Young, \u201cStarving In The Shadow Of Law: A Comment On Finlay V. Canada (Minister Of Finance)\u201d 5:1-4 (1994) Canadian Constitutional Forum 31.</p> <p>The comment was written in 1994, and the Canada Assistance Program (CAP), the subject of the Finlay decision, no longer exists in that form.  It has evolved into the Canada Health Transfer (CHT) and Canada Social Transfer (CST) programs.  The basic premise of federal to provincial transfers for these services has not changed, and there is still criticism of the programs as giving the federal government powerful political influence over Canadian provinces.  Reducing health transfers, for example, would have a severe effect on most provincial health care programs very quickly.</p> <p>In light of this, discuss the following statement from the case comment in today\u2019s environment.  You may want to draw from Finlay and any other cases we have examined or consider today\u2019s political environment in Canada (or any other country) towards social programs funding and the effectiveness of legal v political actions in this area.  Also comment on another student's post.</p> <p>\u201cWithout a more favourable political environment for social welfare issues, attempts to use the courts to force observance or creation of legal (non-constitutional obligations) obligations towards individuals in economic need remain vulnerable to shifts in legislative will.  Litigation such as Finlay is thus politically contained by what political actors will ultimately tolerate and by what legal opportunities political actors are willing to leave open.  Given the current antipathy toward social programmes discussed in the opening paragraphs of this comment, it may be much more effective to engage directly with these politics instead of hoping to circumvent them through legal action.\u201d</p> <p>Samantha's Comment</p> <p>Finlay was a recipient of social assistance who challenged the federal government's allocation of funds to Manitoba under the Canada Assistance Plan (CAP).  He claimed that the payments made to Manitoba violated the terms of CAP, specifically regarding the adequacy and conditions of the welfare payments.  The main issue was whether Finlay, as a private citizen and welfare recipient, had standing to challenge the federal government\u2019s compliance with the Canada Assistance Plan.</p> <p>The SCC ruled in favor of Finlay, granting him public interest standing. The Court held that a private citizen could challenge government action if they have a genuine interest in the issue and there is no other reasonable and effective way to bring the matter before the courts.</p> <p>This case is important because it established a precedent for public interest standing in Canadian law, allowing individuals to challenge government actions that affect the public interest, even if they are not directly harmed by the actions in question.</p> <p>The case also highlighted the role of the courts in reviewing government actions and ensuring their compliance with statutory obligations.</p> <p>Discussion Post</p> <p>The comment correctly notes that the courtroom is neither the best nor the proper venue to pursue social welfare for individuals in economic need. Such protections are better sought through political processes, most effectively realized in the legislative arena.</p> <p>Young shares this view in her article \u201cStarving in the Shadow of Law.\u201d She expresses dissatisfaction with the court\u2019s decision in Finlay, noting that while individuals like Finlay were permitted to litigate, they were unable to obtain substantive relief. According to Young, Finlay did little to advance social justice in welfare law; the formal victory in standing thus contrasts sharply with the substantive defeat for welfare recipients.</p> <p>Nevertheless, Finlay remains a cornerstone case, as it established the precedent for public interest standing in Canadian Administrative Law. It allowed individuals to challenge government actions affecting the public interest, even if they were not personally or directly harmed by those actions.</p> <p>The Court identified two legal issues concerning Mr. Finlay\u2019s standing: first, whether the respondent had a sufficient personal interest in the legality of the impugned law; and second, whether the Court had discretion to recognize public interest standing, thereby granting Mr. Finlay the right to seek judicial review.</p> <p>Regarding the first issue, sufficient personal interest, the Court began by recalling the traditional rule that only the Attorney General has standing to seek declaratory or injunctive relief against a law or public policy. It then cited Boyce v. Paddington Borough Council, [1903] 1 Ch. 109, confirming that a plaintiff may sue without joining the Attorney General in two situations: (1) where interference with a public right also infringes a private right of the plaintiff; or (2) where no private right is infringed, but the plaintiff suffers special damage peculiar to them as a result of interference with the public right.</p> <p>However, the Court emphasized that a \u201cdirect or causal relationship\u201d must exist between the alleged prejudice and the challenged actions. Finding no such causal connection in Finlay\u2019s case, the Court rejected his claim of sufficient personal interest.</p> <p>As for the second issue, public interest standing, the Court reviewed precedents such as Thorson v. Attorney General of Canada, 1974 CanLII 6 (SCC); Nova Scotia Board of Censors v. McNeil, 1975 CanLII 14 (SCC); and Minister of Justice (Canada) v. Borowski, 1981 CanLII 34 (SCC). These cases recognized public interest standing in constitutional challenges but did not address its application to non-constitutional matters.</p> <p>Relying on MacIlReith v. Hart, 1908 CanLII 64 (SCC), and Borowski v. Canada (Attorney General), 1989 CanLII 123 (SCC), the Court held that public interest standing should extend beyond constitutional issues and apply equally to private individuals challenging administrative actions.</p>","tags":["Administrative Law","LAW_V 509 99A 2025W1","Unit 5"]},{"location":"UBC-laws/L509/509Unit5/#52-access-to-justice-case-study-bc-civil-resolution-tribunal","title":"5.2 Access to Justice - Case Study: BC Civil Resolution Tribunal","text":"<p>Access to Justice issues in Canadian law has required some innovating thinking, utilizing new technologies.

Over the years, the population increased. In the towns and villages many people had the same name, and it started to get confusing.</p> <p>In one village there may have been eight men called John. The villagers had to add words to the different Johns' names to understand which John they were talking about.</p> <p>Some of the Johns were known by adding their father's name. For example, John, David's son, or John, Jack's son.</p> <p>Others were known by where they lived. For example, John from the hill, or John from the lake.</p> <p>Others were known by the job they did. For example, John the carpenter or John the gardener.</p> <p>Still others were known by some personal feature. For example, John the short, or John with white hair.</p> <p>Since the Middle Ages, the rulers of many countries wanted to know who everyone was in their country, so they can collect taxes without any mistakes. Laws were passed that said everyone had to have a last name.</p> <p>In our example village, John, David's son became John Davidson. John, Jack's sone became John Jackson. John from the lake became John Lake, John from the hill became John Hill. John the carpenter become John Carpenter, and John the gardener became John Gardener. John the short became John Short. John with white hair became John White.</p> <p>Our last names are usually based on one of the four groups:</p> <ol> <li>father's name</li> <li>place where they lived</li> <li>job or trade</li> <li>person's appearance</li> </ol> <p>Let's look at all the children in Tommy's class and divide their names into the four groups.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2022/06/21/%E8%8B%B1%E6%96%87%E5%90%8D%E5%AD%97%E7%9A%84%E7%94%B1%E6%9D%A5/#names-from-a-father","title":"Names from a Father","text":"<ul> <li>Fitz means \"son of\" and came from France.

The opponents have come to this conclustion based on issued faced by Green Highway last year as well as the keen interest in bicycling of the area's local residents. However, before the recommendation can be properly evaluated, three questions must be answered.</p> <p>First of all, are Green Highway and Blue Highway roughly comparable? In other words, can circumstances from on highway be used to make generalizations and predictions about the other? It is possible that Green Highway and Blue Highway are not similar at all - perhaps Green Highway runs through residential neighborhoods, whereas Blue Highway is located mostly in rural, unpopulated sections of the city. Further, there is a possibility that the quality of the highways is markedly different, with Green Highway's roads falling apart and Blue Highway's in pristine condiction. If either of these scenarios has merit, then conclusion drawn in the original argument is significantly weakened.</p> <p>Secondly, do a majority of the area residents interested in biking live within biking distance of their places of employment? The opponents in the argument prematurely assume that many of the residents in the town will bike to work in the morning rather than drive their cares. However, this might not be the case. Perhaps the average distance from home to work is over 15 miles, and that's why many of the residents are essentially obligated to take the highway - even if they don't want to. In an ideal world, they might choose to bike to work, but if the reality is such that they cannot do so due to the logistics of their situations, then only one form of transportation (the care via the highway) is possible. If the above tis true, then the argument does not hold water.</p> <p>In conclusion, the argument, as it stands out, is considerabley flawed due to its reliance on several unwarranted assumptions. It the author is able to answer the two questions above and offer more evidence (perhaps in the form of a systematic research study), then it will be possible to fully evaluate the viability of the proposed recommendation to add a bike lane to Blue Highway.</p>"},{"location":"blog/2022/06/29/gre-argument-essay-step-by-step/#main-takeaways","title":"Main Takeaways","text":"<ol> <li> <p>When you read the argument, you are needed to identity the following:</p> </li> <li> <p>the main conclusion, main asserttion, or main prediction.</p> </li> <li> <p>the premises, the evidence, or the \"facts\" that led the author to this conclusion</p> </li> <li> <p>With the correct identification of the conclusion and the evidence, you have to do something very important: reason the unstated assumptions out.</p> </li> <li> <p>this is where the bulk of your writing grade for the argument essay comes from.

In fact, it is not uncommon for entering students to reminate on this decision for months, perhaps years, and then, once a decision has been made, immediately begin to second guess it.<sup>1</sup>The prompt recommends that students not belabor this point too long and simply choose a path that conforms most closely to their interests and skills. <sup>2</sup> In my opinion, I strongly agree with this suggestion and argue that students look inward rather than outward when choosing college courses for three reasons.<sup>3</sup></p> <p>To begin, the job market is ever shifting, and one decade's \"hot\" job is another decades's dying one. Thus, to choose one's professioin based solely on the availability of work is to take a short-term perspective, one that will likely backfire. <sup>4</sup> For instance, in the 1950s through the 1980s, nuclear engineering was a rapidly growing field as many of the most powerful nations on Earth were not only designing and manufacturing nuclear weapons, but hundreds of nuclear power plants as well. Consequently, nuclear engineering graduates were able to find high-paying work almost immediately upon graduation. However, because of issues related to not in my back yard and recent nuclear accidents like the well-publicized Fukushima disaster, many countries are moving away from nuclear power in favor of other green technologies. Students who chose nuclear engineering in the 1970s because of the \"abundant\" job prospects were certainly facing a different job market in the 1990s - and this market has only worsened throught the 2000s. <sup>5</sup> The above example illustrated that the job market is highly contingent upon unpredictable factors and that, if one assumes it is static, he or she is likely to get burned at some point in the future. It seems absurd to think of now during the current technological boom, but will the software engineering industry still possess dizzying job prospects in the future? History tells us that it will not. <sup>6</sup></p> <p>Further, even if we assume that the job market is not dynamic, that it is as unchanging as gravity, one should still pursue his or her interests because our happiness level plays a crucial role in how effectively we work. <sup>4</sup> For instance, if a student who is passionate about horst training \"pragmatically\" chooses the path of computer programming becasue of the plethora of lucrattive job oppotunities, she runs the risk of finding herself in a field she abhors and a job she finds no satisfaction in. She might go to work each day, sit at her desk, adn stare at her computer screen with the horse wallpaper, wondering what could have been and the career path she could have chosen. She might complete her programming tasks haphazardly and submit subpar work. <sup>5</sup> Research has consistently demonstrated that, perhaps above all other factors, happiness has the most direct effect on work efficiency. In other words, worders who find personal satisfaction in their craft not only work faster, but produce higher qualify products and services as well. Thus, on a macro scale, governments should enourage their populations to pursue their passions because, long-term, doing so leads to a more smoothly functioning economy not bogged down by worker discontentment. <sup>6</sup></p> <p>Of course, some argue that in our increasingly globalized economy competition for jobs has skyroceketed and thus it is imperative that we pursue practical paths. <sup>7</sup>However, isn't that precisely why we should following our interests? If we do so, we're likely to do the best job possible. We're likely to compete at the highest level. We're likely to carve out a niche for ourselves in this \"increasingly globalized world\". People who ignore their inner voices do so at their own peril. <sup>8</sup></p> <ol> <li> <p>Hook.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Shift to prompt.\u00a0\u21a9</p> </li> <li> <p>Thesis.\u00a0\u21a9</p>

Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine <ul> <li>Prospectors came to the desert hoping to find gold and silver in the mountains.</li> <li>One legend in particular has captured the imaginations of Arizonans, even to this day.</li> <li>In 1868, a farmer moved to Phoenix. He had dreams of striking it rich.</li> <li>He and his burro used to disappear for days at a time into the Superstition Mountains. Every so often, he emerged from the mountains with big chunks of solid gold.</li> <li>His eyes darted from side to side and sweat dripped from his forehead.</li> <li>Before Billy realized what was happening, they were at the outskirts of the city and climbing into the foothills.</li> <li>Mr. Martinez gripped the steering wheel with two hands and gazed straight ahead. Then he pressed down even harder on the gas pedal. \u201cHoly geez-grubbers!\u201d Billy blurted out.</li> <li>Their truck veered off onto a bumpy, dirt road.</li> <li>\u201cOh gosh,\u201d Billy sighed as he slapped his forehead in disbelief. They\u2019ve gone mad, absolutely bonkers!</li> <li>Mr. Martinez carefully pulled the truck off the right-hand side of the road and parked it behind two mesquite <code>[m\u01dds-gee-t]</code> trees.</li> <li>He found a flashlight, two cans of beans, a full canteen, a musty pillow, and an old Mexican blanket.</li> <li>Billy looked around at the Sonoran Desert. There were just sharp cacti, loose rocks, steep mountains, and a scorching sun.</li> <li>He knows that rattlesnakes, scorpions, coyotes, and Gila <code>[hee-la]</code> monsters roamed this desert.</li> <li>Knives can be used for cooking, whittling wood, or hurting.</li> <li>\u201cDo you think that\u2019s a monsoon storm coming this way?\u201d Billy wondered out loud.</li> <li>It wound back and forth through the foothills and over dry washes.</li> <li>Next to the trail, old saguaro <code>[s\u01dd-wah-row]</code> cacti stood like the gatekeepers of these desert mountains.</li> <li>The three stared silently into the mesmerizing fire.</li> <li>Everybody has their theories. Some believe Waltz hid the entrance with rocks. Others believe an earthquake covered it up. Skeptics claim that it is just a myth.</li> <li>\u201cAnd on the next day, they found a nugget of gold on the trail,\u201d he whispered. \u201cIt was the size of a baseball.\u201d</li> <li>One howl turned into a chorus of yapping and howling.</li> <li>\u201cKeep yourselves hydrated, boys,\u201d he said, \u201cbecause there\u2019s no telling how fast we might have to run down this hill!\u201d</li> <li>Now empty out your packs. Let\u2019s stash everything behind these trees.</li> <li>At the mine\u2019s entrance, the old burro was tied to a rock. The tattered rope was fastened around her neck by just one loose knot.</li> <li>Billy cringed, \u201cBe quiet, you guys!\u201d he screamed down the tunnel. \u201cHe could hear you!\u201d</li> <li>\u201cJacob! Billy! Heather!\u201d Mr. Martinez said in an exasperated <code>[ig-zes-per-rated]</code> tone. \u201cI\u2019m trying to teach class here. What should I do with you three?\u201d</li> </ul> 2. Adventure on the Amazon River <ul> <li>\u201cDad, I already told you! I don\u2019t speak Portuguese, and I don\u2019t want to learn.\u201d</li> <li>\u201cIf I get malaria, I\u2019m holding you two responsible. This trip was your idea.\u201d</li> <li>I couldn\u2019t sleep very well in my hammock. Mon says I\u2019m getting cranky already. But nobody here is my age!</li> <li>Brian is having a party on Friday, and our soccer team has a tournament over the weekend.</li> <li>Cammy and Gabriela threw their bags in close proximity to the canoe.</li> <li>Cammy squinted to see her face, but the canoe had already drifted too far away.</li> <li>The sky was almost totally black, but she could tell that it was dawn. There was a hint of fuchsia <code>[fu-(trea)sure]</code> in the black and a faint steak of orange below.</li> <li>But Cammy\u2019s body leaned too far forward, and her knees pivoted over the rail.</li> <li>There were no houses in sight, but Cammy did spy a narrow tributary winding back through the jungle.</li> <li>A big mosquito landed on her arms and stared sucking her blood. She slapped at it frantically.</li> <li>She took the opportunity to study their faces, dirty fingernails, and bare feet. These were the kind of exotic people that she had only seen on television.</li> <li>Last night my body was really itchy. I think there are fleas in my bed.</li> <li>This morning Ixtola and I went to the garden and pulled up manioc <code>[meni-au-k]</code> roots.</li> <li>And there we found some bananas just growing on trees! Ixtola cut them down with her machete <code>[m\u01dd-sh-e-di]</code>.</li> <li>Next to the man was a woman. She clutched a plastic bag in her right hand.</li> </ul> 3. Treasure in Puget Sound <ul> <li>My friends suggested that I record the story of the treasure on an island in Puget <code>[pu-dgi]</code> Sound.</li> <li>Bones was a large man with a hideous knife scar across his cheek.</li> <li>Bones swaggered into the inn, placed $200 on the counter, and demanded a room.</li> <li>After a few drinks, he got loud and swore.</li> <li>A couple more drinks and he sang old, vulgar sailing songs.</li> <li>\u201cWhere is it?\u201d Black Dog demanded. He pulled a long, shimmering knife from his jacket.</li> <li>When the doctor kicked Black Dog in the back, sending him sprawling, the knife slid under the bed.</li> <li>The ship was outfitted like a fishing vessel so that it wouldn\u2019t attract attention.</li> <li>He told me to report to Old John Gold in the galley <code>[Kitchen on board]</code>.</li> <li>He had a wooden leg and used a crutch to get around.</li> <li>John Gold was a strange man, but he didn\u2019t seem to be the ruthless pirate that Bones thought he was.</li> <li>Dr. Living agreed that the crew seemed untrustworthy. He believed the captain and John Gold were the only honest men on the ship.</li> <li>There were so many islands in the Puget Sound, it confounds <code>[k-un-founds]</code> me how anyone could tell one from another.</li> <li>Once we were heading toward home, he and his men would mutiny and commandeer <code>[common-deer]</code> the ship. All those who opposed him would be killed.</li> <li>I panicked and just before he reached into the barrel, another of the men suggested they drink to seal their plan. Agreeing enthusiastically, they all went to get their rum.</li> <li>He said his name was Ron Gunn and that he had been stranded for many years.</li> <li>Scoundrels would do anything to get their hands on that much money.</li> <li>Gunn wanted to separate Gold from the others so that he could get revenge for being left behind on the island all those years. He said it was Gold who gave the orders for him to be marooned.</li> <li>The others would then jump Gold\u2019s men and subdue them.</li> <li>I hate lying, and I was very afraid of Gold. He was a perceptive man, and he might suspect I wasn\u2019t telling the truth.</li> <li>\u201cWell, then, we have ourselves a standoff,\u201d Gold said. He seemed to be enjoying the tension of the situation.</li> <li>I was squirming <code>[move from side to side]</code> and he pulled on my hair until I stood still.</li> <li>I took a deep breath and summoned up all the courage I could find.</li> <li>I led them to the stashed money, and we began to move the boxes out of the cave, with the captain and the doctor doing most of the work.</li> <li>Gold was gone. He must have escaped in the commotion.</li> </ul> 4. Pyramids <ul> <li>Of all the people living in ancient Egypt, no one was given a more lavish burial than a pharaoh.</li> <li>A scribe <code>[a professional penman]</code> recorded all the materials needed for building the pyramid using the ancient Egyptian writing system, called hieroglyphics.</li> <li>Other stones were put on sledges, or large wooden sleds, which were then dragged across the desert sands.</li> <li>Granite from even farther away was used for the pharaoh\u2019s coffin, called a sarcophagus <code>[sar-'co-fa-gus]</code>, as well as to decorate the burial chamber.</li> <li>This technique, called mummification, preserved the body for thousands of years.</li> <li>The body was taken to an embalmer, who removed the insides and preserved them in canopic jars.</li> <li>Then it was washed, rubbed with oil and fragrant spices, and packed with preservatives.</li> <li>Afterward, it was wrapped with many layers of linen soaked in resin <code>[viscous substance]</code> to hold its shape.</li> <li>Their pyramids are surrounded by other pyramids for their queens, as well as stone mastabas, tombs made of mud bricks, for the rest of the royal family and members of the court.</li> <li>The Sphinx, a limestone statue with the face of a king and the body of a lion, guards the entire site.</li> <li>The only intact burial of an Egyptian king ever found is that of King Tutankhamun <code>[too-d\u01ddn-car-men]</code>.</li> <li>These pyramids had stairways decorated with sculptures and inscriptions that led to temples at the top.</li> <li>One of the most famous Mayan pyramids is Chichen Itza.</li> </ul> 12. Ancient Cliff Dwellers <ul> <li>The arid, or dry, conditions at Mesa Verde <code>[may-sa ve-a-day]</code> are ideal for preserving skeletons, mummies, dwellings, tools and trash piles.</li> <li>Other remains include pictographs, or painting on stone, and petroglyphs, or pictures carved in stone.</li> <li>Men used large spears to hunt huge herd animals, including elephant-like animals called mammoths, and mastodons, and giant bison.</li> <li>The earliest Ancient Puebloans <code>[poo-eb-low-unz]</code> still relied mostly on hunting and gathering.</li> <li>The houses were built side by side, creating large buildings called pueblos. Pueblo is a Spanish word that means \"town\" or \"village\".</li> <li>They are among the finest artists in the world, creating exquisite pottery, jewelry, baskets carvings, and weavings.</li> </ul> 13. Mysterious Caves <ul> <li>These cave explorers, or spelunkers <code>[s-bee-lun-ger]</code>, had already visited several large caves in the area.</li> <li>Suddenly, they saw light. A shaft of sunlight was cutting through the darkness ahead of them.</li> <li>Water from the surface seeps through the soil or trickles through cracks in the ground. Over millions of years, the water eats away at the rock and creates a karst cave.</li> <li>The flowing hot lava creates long tunnels through the solid lava rock. These long tunnel caves are called lava tubes.</li> <li>Do you forget which is a stalactite <code>[sta-lag-tite]</code> and which is a stalagmite <code>[sta-lag-mite]</code>?</li> <li>These trails can build up to form a drapery, or curtain of rock.</li> <li>They include certain millipedes, centipedes, spiders, insects, crayfish, salamanders, and fish.</li> <li>In Andalucia <code>[on-de-loo-sia]</code>, Spain, hundreds of people live in caves.</li> <li>In 1940, four boys accidentally discovered one of the most famous art caves, France's Lascaux <code>[lah-s-go]</code> Cave.</li> <li>Bats there had a strange white fuzz around their mouths and noses.</li> <li>One of the most world-famous caves is the Chauvet <code>[shaw-vay]</code> Cave in France.</li> <li>As the spelunkers go deeper, they may have to wriggle through tiny tunnels.</li> </ul> 14. The Sun <ul> <li>The Sun's far-reaching gravity prevents Earth and its seven sister planets from flying off their elliptical orbits into the vast universe.</li> <li>Compared to billions of other stars, the Sun is small. Some astronomers call it the yellow runt.</li> <li>The energy producing reaction in the core is called a thermonuclear reaction.</li> <li>The most violent are solar flares, which are large loops of energy shooting high above the Sun's surface.</li> <li>Energy from the Sun travels to Earth as electromagnetic waves called radiant energy, which only turn into heat when they are absorbed by matter.</li> <li>Examples of radiant energy include visible light, infrared light, and ultraviolet waves.</li> <li>When the radiant energy is absorbed, it changes to heat as the visible light or infrared waves agitate the molecules in the matter struck by the waves.</li> <li>Aluminum foil and styrofoam.</li> <li>A skin cancer, called melanoma <code>[me-la-'no-ma]</code>, is caused by overexposure to the Sun's harmful ultraviolet rays.</li> <li>The Sun's powerful rays can burn the cornea, the sensitive area of your eyes that makes it possible for you to see.</li> </ul> 15. Natural Wonders of the World <ul> <li>Although they rarely bite humans, the Grand Canyon rattlesnake and the diamondback rattlesnake are venomous.</li> <li>A farmer discovered a fissure, or opening in this ground.</li> <li>Eventually, all that was left of Paricutin was the church steeple rising out of the black rock as a reminder of nature's power.</li> <li>Most cinder cones have a bowl-shaped crater at the top.</li> <li>Victoria Falls is located on the border between Zambia and Zimbabwe in Africa.</li> <li>The pool into which the water falls is called a plunge pool.</li> <li>A bridge at the Falls is a popular site for bungee jumping.</li> <li>One of the reasons the yak is able to survive is because its blood can take in more oxygen than the blood of other animals.</li> <li>The yeti, or Abominable Snowman, is a legend of Mount Everest and the Himalayas.</li> <li>The Great Barrier Reef might look like a rock, but it's...made from the skeletons of millions of animals called polyps.</li> <li>Responsible snorkelers and scuba divers should always follow these important rules.</li> <li>The Barringer <code>[ba-rin-ger]</code> Meteorite Crater, a massive hold in the Arizona desert that is almost a mile wide and 174 meters deep.</li> <li>Ayers <code>[air-z]</code> Rock, the world's largest solid rock, rising 862.5 meters above sea level in Uluru, Australia.</li> </ul> 15. Female Sports Stars <ul> <li>Women's professional tennis, basketball, and soccer draw thousands of spectators.</li> <li>In 1997, Mia Hamm's brother Garret developed aplastic anemia <code>[A-plastic a-nee-mia]</code>, a rare blood disease that affected his bone marrow. He received a bone marrow transplant from a healthy donor, which might have cured him, but unfortunately he died of complications from the transplant.</li> <li>To commemorate Garret's life, and to help others with similar struggles, the Mia Hamm Foundation raises money for bone marrow research, and to support families of people who receive transplants.</li> <li>Richard Williams claims to have know before the birth of his daughters Venus and Serena that they would become tennis champions.</li> <li>When the girls were young, they would pack they family car with racquets, tennis balls, and a broom, and go to the local park to practice.</li> <li>Since then, the Williams sisters have won every big-name tournament, including the French Open, the U.S. Open, and Wimbledon.</li> <li>The sisters credit their success to hard work and a positive attitude.</li> <li>A nearby surfer made a tourniquet <code>[ter-ni-git]</code> from a rubber surf leash.</li> <li>Bethany Hamilton has returned to her pre-attach routine of strenuous workouts, school, and surfing competitions.</li> </ul> 40. A Pioneer's Life <ul> <li>Three-year-old Laura Ingalls Wilder and her older sister, Mary, followed their father across the vast, rolling prairies.</li> <li>Warm wind stirred Laura's hair, and insects and birds sang in the rippling grass. On the walk home, the sunset stained the sky pink and gold.</li> <li>in the 1800s, pioneers streamed westward. They cleared the forests and plowed up the tough sod, or grass roots, that covered the prairie in order to cultivate crops.</li> <li>The big woods were dark, wild and mysterious. On long winter evenings, Pa played his fiddle for the family. His music accompanied the happiest days of Laura's childhood.</li> <li>From a distance, the house appeared to be nothing more than a gentle hill rising from the banks of a creek.</li> <li>Grasshoppers, arriving in swarms as big as thunderstorms, ate all the family's wheat.</li> <li>One blizzard after another hammered the new town. At last the long winter broke, and the family returned to their homestead on the blooming Dakota prairie.</li> <li>Laura bravely said goodbye to her family, but she dreaded being away from home for an entire semester.</li> <li>During their long drives across the prairie, their friendship blossomed into love.</li> <li>Unfortunately, the young family was hit with a string of bad luck.</li> <li>Laura searched for a new place where they could get a fresh start. It wasn't long before she found her home.</li> <li>Laura began to pour her memories onto the page. Soon, she had written an entire book about her early years under the towering trees of Wisconsin.</li> <li>Who wanted to hear about doing backbreaking chores in a dark forest?</li> <li>The book was an immediate hit. Laura brought to life the howling winter wind, the crackling fire, and the joyful skip of Pa's fiddle.</li> <li>The mailbox at Rocky Ridge overflowed with letters from young readers begging for more. Her stories of pioneer life still delight young readers today.</li> </ul> 73. Machu Picchu <ul> <li>Nestled in the towering Andes Mountains of Peru, Machu Picchu, an ancient city of the Inca, is one of the most mysterious and haunting places in the world.</li> <li>Today, many archaeologists think that Machu Picchu served as a royal estate for Inca emperors.</li> <li>Machu Picchu is known for the tightly interlocking walls, which are seen in few other places in the world. The Inca fit stones together so well that nothing was needed to hold them in place. Today, if you tried to slip a knife between the stones, it would not fit.</li> <li>The urban area's Temple of the Sun might have been used as a solar observatory. On the winter solstice, sunlight enters a window and shines on a large rock in the middle of the room.</li> <li>In 1532 Spanish explorer Francisco Pizarro attacked the Inca. Years of fighting and disease brought by Europeans weakened the Inca Empire and caused its decline.</li> <li>Machu Picchu was named a World Heritage Site, carrying a special cultural meaning for all of humankind.</li> </ul> 74. Grasslands <ul> <li>Deserts, rainforests, oceans, and tundra are examples of biomes. So are grasslands.</li> <li>Tropical grasslands are located in hot tropical climates between the Tropic of Cancer and Tropic of Capricorn.</li> <li>Temperate grasslands are found in cool temperate climates outside the Tropics.</li> <li>Tropical grasslands in Africa is called Savannas, while the temperate grasslands go by different names in different parts of the world. They are called prairies and plains in North America, steppes in Europe and Asia, veldts in Southern Africa, and pampas in South America.</li> <li>The top lawyer of soil, called humus, is made up of decomposing organic material, which provides most of the nutrients.</li> <li>Most of North America's tallgrass prairie has been converted to farmland and ranchland. The tallgrass prairie existed in balance for thousands of years, thanks to a perfect combination of rainfall, fire and grazing.</li> </ul> 76. Dolores Huerta <ul> <li>The racism-fueled violence deeply affected Dolores.</li> <li>Seeing her students, many of them children of farmworkers, often come to school hungry and without proper clothing left Dolores longing to do more.</li> <li>Dolores Huerta changed her focus to working as a labor activist.</li> <li>Farmworkers frequently worked in the fields from dawn to dust without a break.</li> <li>Huerta helped cancel the Bracero Program in 1964 to pave the way for better conditions for farmworkers.</li> <li>Grape pickers received a pay raise and the first union contract for farmworkers in American history. Now grape pickers could negotiate as a group, using strength in numbers to ask for better pay and conditions.</li> <li>In a 2017 interview with NPR, she discussed the issues women face when struggling to balance work and family.</li> <li>While Latinos made up 17% of the US population in 2017, Latino elected officials remain underrepresented.</li> <li>She has worked persistently as a lobbyist for issues in which she believes.</li> <li>In many different ways, Dolores Huerta has made a lasting impact on American history.</li> </ul> 79. How Advertising Works <ul> <li>Critical thinking is the ability to analyze information and identify its purpose and trustworthiness.</li> <li>Wherever we go and whatever we see, chances are an ad is already waiting there for us.</li> <li>Advertisers use three main appeals to convince customers to take action. They are often names using Greek words: ethos, logos and pathos.</li> <li>Ethos is based on credibility, how believable the person giving the message is.</li> <li>Logos appeals to logic or reason. For example, an ad about a truck might give facts about how powerful it is.</li> <li>Pathos appeals to emotions, like excitement or fear. By trying to get viewers to feel a certain way, the ad hopes to convince them to buy or do something.</li> <li>Anti-smoking and anti-bullying ads are examples of these kinds of public service announcements.</li> <li>At age seven to eleven, children know that ads are sales pitches.</li> </ul>","tags":["Reading

It can also help to make sure you have not missed anything</li> </ul> </li> <li>How can you show empathy to your client?<ul> <li>Empathy and sympathy are different concepts \u2013 sympathy is simply feeling sorry for a person's circumstances, but empathy involves putting yourself in the client's shoes and attempting to truly identify with their experience</li> <li>Empathy can be reflected in statements such as \"That must have been embarrassing for you\" or \"That seems to have made you angry\"</li> <li>Empathy might also be reflected in your body language or facial expressions, such as exhibiting a look of genuine concern, or nodding your head (be aware however that different cultures may have different ways of expressing empathy)</li> </ul> </li> <li>How reliable is a person's non-verbal communication?<ul> <li>Non-verbal communication can be a very valuable source of information about a client's unspoken feelings, but it can also be easily misunderstood, especially when dealing cross-culturally. For example, in North American culture, eye contact means honesty. In other cultures, looking someone directly in the eye can be interpreted as disrespect.</li> <li>It is therefore important to reflect your thoughts back to the client by asking questions or prompting discussion in order to confirm that your understanding is correct. For example, \"I notice that you are moving around in your chair a lot.

If the person reviewing the report believes the report is well-founded, she may:<ul> <li>Refer the report to the Immigration Division for an admissibility hearing</li> <li>Issue a removal order</li> <li>Decide not to proceed with the matter (often based on H &amp; C considerations)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Under s. 44(2) IRPA, if the Minister\u2019s Delegate finds the report to be well-founded, they will either issue a removal order or refer the matter for a hearing in front of the Immigration Division of the IRB. This is governed by s. 228 IRPR.</li> <li>Permanent residents always get a hearing before the Immigration Division unless the report is based only on failure to meet residency obligation, in which case a removal order is directly issued.</li> <li>Due to the combined operation of s. 36 of IRPA (criminal inadmissibility) and s. 64(2) of IRPA (no right of appeal to the IAD), Mr. Sidhu faces the prospect of deportation without any evaluation of his personal circumstances.</li> <li>s. 63(3) IRPA - A permanent resident or a protected person may appeal to the Immigration Appeal Division against a decision to make a removal order against them made under subsection 44(2) or made at an admissibility hearing.</li> <li>s. 63(4) IRPA - A permanent resident may appeal to the Immigration Appeal Division against a decision made outside of Canada on the residency obligation under section 28.</li> <li>The following permanent residents are not eligible to appeal their removal order (s. 64 IRPA):<ul> <li>Inadmissible on grounds of security, violating human or international rights, or organized criminality</li> <li>Inadmissible for serious criminality (defined in s. 64(2) IRPA - includes crimes punished in Canada by a prison term of six months or more)</li> </ul> </li> <li>A removal order that may not be appealed to the IAD may be judicially reviewed in the Federal Court of Canada. The relevant limitation period is 15 days, because it is a decision made inside Canada.

Read s. 49(1) IRPA regarding when a removal order comes into force (becomes effective). A removal order comes into force on the latest of the following dates:<ul> <li>(a) the day the removal order is made, if there is no right to appeal;</li> <li>(b) the day the appeal period expires, if there is a right to appeal and no appeal is made; and</li> <li>(c) the day of the final determination of the appeal, if an appeal is made.</li> </ul> </li> <li>PR status is not lost until a removal order is made and it comes into force.

You notice that in the middle of the interview the client's attention is wandering.  A good strategy to refocus the client is to:</p> <ul> <li> Carry on with the interview, the client will regain focus on their own.</li> <li> Cut the interview short and reschedule the interview for another day/time</li> <li> Ask the client if they need a break to help refocus their attention</li> <li> Call the client out on their lack of focus and remind the client that your time is valuable. Clients are subject to the same internal distractions that we are, and especially those who have experiences stress and trauma. As Cochran notes in Chapter 4, it is important to be sensitive to a client's ability to focus by demonstrating an empathic and flexible approach, such as inviting them to take a break or stretch their legs (pp. 77-78).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>True or False: As an interviewer, you have no control over the physical environment that the interview takes place in.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False There are many aspects of the physical space that the interviewer has control over including the location, size of room, and distractions (pp. 72-74).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>True or False:  To maintain professionalism, interviews should always be conducted in your office.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False While it may be the most professional setting, it may not always be possible or ideal to have an interview in your office.

A good listener doesn't ask a lot of questions to fill up space, but is responsive and allows the other person to tell their story without interruption.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>True or False:  About 90% of what we communicate is non-verbal in nature.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False In Chapter 5 (p. 85) Cochran states that as a rule of thumb 90% of what we communicate is non-verbal.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>A good listener does the following:</p> <ul> <li> Conveys their interest in both what the speaker is saying and in the speaker themself</li> <li> Interjects frequently to clarify points</li> <li> Ensures the client knows the breadth of the listener\u2019s expertise</li> <li> Stops the client from straying into areas which are irrelevant</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>True or False:  You should always make a digital recording of your interviews with clients in order to get an accurate account of all the information obtained.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False There are many reasons why it's may not be a good idea to record your client interviews, including that it might put off your clients, and it's time consuming to review the recording and transcribe it. As indicated in Chapter 5, a better option is to take good notes instead (p. 82).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Which of the following is NOT a good reason to avoid audio recording your client interview?</p> <ul> <li> If you make a mistake, there will be no proof \u2013 avoiding responsibility is not a good reason for anything \u2013 furthermore, if you\u2019ve taken good notes then there will still be evidence of your error</li> <li> May make the client uncomfortable and less apt to be forthcoming</li> <li> Could generate mistrust with the client</li> <li> Makes more work for the interviewer (reviewing the recording to take notes)</li> <li> May put the client off</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Client needs are often entangled with legal and non-legal components. A reason why being attuned to the emotional aspects of your client's needs is important is because:</p> <ul> <li> Unless you deal with the emotional components of your client's needs, it will interfere with the legal aspects of their needs</li> <li> Legal professionals have a responsibility and duty to solve their client's emotional concerns</li> <li> It helps to categorize clients better in relation to their problems</li> <li> All of the above Legal professionals are not therapists, however ignoring or diminishing a client's emotional needs hinders your ability to serve their legal needs.  Helping clients with their legal problems can often alleviate some of the emotional difficulties they are experiencing (p. 104).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Which if the following are good note-taking habits:</p> <ul> <li> Use the client\u2019s own language when taking notes.</li> <li> Review the notes with the client before concluding the interview.</li> <li> Develop a shorthand or use a laptop to enable regular eye contact with client.</li> <li> Use a red pen</li> <li> All but D</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>True or False:  The best way to overcome any biases you observe in your own conduct is to ignore them</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False You should observe and pay close attention to your own perceptions and biases. At Cochran notes in Chapter 5, once your are aware of your biases you may be able to avoid the distortions they cause and create a more objective interviewing experience.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>In a client interview setting pauses and silences:</p> <ul> <li> may provide surprising opportunities that produce valuable information</li> <li> are something you should try to avoid at all costs</li> <li> should be immediately filled with questions or comments</li> <li> are always discomforting and awkward for clients Pauses and silences can be an effective non-verbal technique and are not always a negative thing to be avoided.  Deliberate use of pauses and silences can sometime be used as opportunities for clients to provide more information (p. 88).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The listening process can be broken down into two components: passive and active listening.  An example of good active listening is:</p> <ul> <li> Silences to allow the interviewee an opportunity to speak</li> <li> Gestures such as smiling and body language</li> <li> Comments that acknowledge the emotional content of what was said</li> <li> Asking open-ended questions Good active listening involves responding to the speaker's comments to demonstrate you heard and understood the content and also acknowledging the emotional content of the comments (pp. 97-101). \"B\" This is an example of passive listening (pp. 94-95)</li> </ul> </li> </ol> 5.1 Permanent Residents and Residency Requirements <ol> <li> <p>If a permanent resident is traveling abroad, can a permanent resident card be issued to them from a Canadian Embassy?</p> <ul> <li> Yes</li> <li> No (according to R.55, a PR card can be issued only inside Canada)</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Where can a permanent resident make an application to renew a permanent resident card?</p> <ul> <li> At a Visa Application Centre (VAC)</li> <li> At an office inside Canada \u2013 according to R.56, a PR card application must be made inside Canada</li> <li> At a Canadian Embassy or Consulate</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Yvonne is a citizen of The Netherlands and a Canadian Permanent Resident.

It is also helpful to use more closed questions when your client is nervous or forgetful.  In addition, if you have a client who is long-winded, closed questions help keep your client focused on the relevant information (pp. 117-118).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>True or False:  According to the funnel sequence, it is best practice to start an interview with a series of narrow questions.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False The funnel sequence begins with broad open questions at first and then moves to more narrow specific questions (p. 125).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>True or False: It is vital to get all the information required in the initial client interview.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False It is not always possible to obtain all the required information needed in the initial client interview, and often some type of follow up is required (p. 132).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>If you want to determine what your client learned in his first ski lesson, the following questions could be asked. An example of a good approach for an initial interview might be:</p> <ul> <li> They couldn't have taught you much in half an hour.</li> <li> Can you tell me what the first lesson consisted of?</li> <li> Did you learn how to turn or slow down in that lesson?</li> <li> Did they teach you how to snowplow in the first lesson? Yes, an open question approach would work best. By asking, \u201cCan you tell me what the first lesson consisted of?\u201d the interviewer provides an opportunity for the client to recount his experience without interviewer contamination. This approach avoids the problem that comes when the interview is restricted to the interviewer\u2019s anticipated answers.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>It\u2019s a best practice in interviewing to use open questions at all stages of the interview process.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False Open questions are useful at all stages of an interview. That doesn\u2019t mean there isn\u2019t a place for closed or narrow questions but if you value quality information, give the client a chance to provide you with it rather than trying to show how smart you are by jumping to conclusions, even those that you think are obvious.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Which of the following is an example of an open question?</p> <ul> <li> You have come here today to discuss your visa application, correct?</li> <li> Tell me what has brought you here today?</li> <li> Has your visa application been denied?</li> <li> Do you know when your visa application was sent?</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>An interview solely using closed questions will be:</p> <ul> <li> be dominated by the interviewer\u2019s perspective on the situation.</li> <li> will not leave any room for the nuances of the client\u2019s personal experience or point of view.</li> <li> effective in uncovering the specifics particular to the client\u2019s experience.</li> <li> A and B</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>True or False: The following are all examples of probing questions:</p> <ul> <li>The accident happened at 1:30 p.m., so you hadn't been drinking?</li> <li>You didn't see whether he picked up the knife, I take it?</li> <li>You were sober when you left your house?</li> <li>Would I be correct to assume you want to submit your permanent residence application very quickly so you can get on with your life?</li> <li> True</li> <li> False These questions are all examples of leading questions. By asking leading questions, the interviewer influences or directs the respondent to an answer that the interviewer either prefers or, at the very least, anticipates. The interviewer tends to restrict the potential answers when leading and thus corrupts the information being received. A leading question directs the respondent to an answer, thereby injecting the interviewer's perspective into the interview.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Let's say you want to elicit some information about the quality of instruction. Would you ask:</p> <ul> <li> What can you tell me about the quality of instruction in the class?</li> <li> Did the instructor tell you how much teaching experience he had?</li> <li> Did the instructor seem to know what he was talking about or not?</li> <li> I don't imagine they pay these instructors very much, do they?</li> <li> Were any of your instructors Swiss?</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>True or False: Either/or questions can be misleading because they imply that there are only two possibilities in a given situation.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False While there are often two obvious or even likely actions, usually there are a multitude of possibilities. Even when there are only two possibilities, by posing an either/or question the interviewer loses the benefit of hearing the description in the client's own words. This can be extremely valuable in alerting the immigration consultant to subtle nuances in the circumstances of the situation and in knowing how the client will manage the litigation process.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> 5.3.3 Economic Immigration <ol> <li> <p>Immigration is the shared responsibility of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC), Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) and Economic and Social Development Canada (ESDC).

He is earning approx. $100k a year and the prevailing wage for his position is $87k. The CSA has offered him a permanent full-time position with the organization. The CSA has put their job offer in writing, in support of his Permanent Resident application via the online Express Entry portal. George has asked you whether he can be granted points for \"arranged employment\". What is the best response?</p> <ul> <li> Yes \u2013 Because the employer has offered him a permanent and full-time position after he becomes a Permanent Resident of Canada.</li> <li> No \u2013 Because he is on an open work permit and thus points for \"arranged employment\" cannot be awarded unless the employer provides a formal written job offer for at least one year of full-time employment</li> <li> No \u2013 Because it must be a government approved job offer in order to be awarded points for \"arranged employment\".</li> <li> Yes \u2013 Because he has worked for at least one year for the specific employer who has offered him a written job offer. In order for arranged employment to qualify towards points in Express Entry, the foreign national must have either (1) an LMIA for ESCE and a formal written job offer, OR (2) be working for a specified employer for at lease 1 year on an LMIA-exempt work permit, AND have a written formal job offer for at least one year.  Since, the Post Graduate Work Permit is an open work permit, the job offer that George has will not qualify towards additional points for arranged employment, unless the employer provides a written job offer for at least one year of full-time employment.

An informal interview is unstructured and free-flowing, including a chat with a friend, or meeting someone for the first time and getting to know them on a blind date.

First, it is directive and only takes into account what the interviewer feels is important at that point in time. It does not acknowledge what is important, or even necessary, for the client to deal with. Second, it is condescending, suggesting that the client has jumped off topic and that it is necessary for the interviewer to intervene to get things back on track. Better to say something like, \u201cThose are some pretty good points, Mr. Brown, and thank you for raising them. I have a concern that we are a little short on time and I am going to need some more information in relation to your establishment in Canada/year of education back home/etc. or we won\u2019t be able to properly prepare the application for submission by the end of the week.\u201d</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>True or False: In an interview, one party usually has the formal task of information gathering.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False As noted in Chapter 2 of the Cochran text, interviews are usually an exchange between two people one of whom has the task of information gathering.  While there are group interview formats, only one person can ask questions at a time (p. 34).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>You are interviewing a client in person for a spousal sponsorship and they seem very nervous and overwhelmed. The best way to help the new client feel more comfortable in an interview setting is to:</p> <ul> <li> Incorporate legalese into your language to assure the client of your knowledge and expertise</li> <li> Tell the client they have no reason to be nervous and proceed with the interview</li> <li> Hand the client an intake form to fill out</li> <li> Offer the client a tea, coffee, or a glass of water Simple language without legalese or jargon will help the client to understand the process and feel more comfortable in the interview. Avoid invalidating or dismissing a client's feelings of anxiety.

The reasons for this are because:</p> <ul> <li> By acknowledging the emotional aspect\u2019s importance, the immigration consultant begins to establish a rapport with the client.</li> <li> If the emotional component is not dealt with properly, it will continue to interfere with the consultant\u2019s interviewing agenda. Think of trying to shove and hold a volleyball under water\u2014it can only be accomplished with continued effort.</li> <li> Understanding the emotional component of the issue for the client will help the immigration consultant to understand the client and the issue the client is facing, and it will assist in the development of a strategy tailored to their needs.</li> <li> All of the above D: For example, if the consultant has a client who is experiencing extreme anxiety, getting the matter to hearing quickly may not be the best strategy.

Questionaries, written survey and more directive questions are more useful for other objectives such as information gathering, and assessments.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Building rapport with a client always takes considerable time so an immigration consultant should not expect to foster rapport in early on in their interactions with clients.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False Building rapport will serve the immigration consultant well in both identifying issues and fact gathering, so it is extremely important to do it early on and do it well.

As Cochran notes in Chapter 3, there are many reasons, including cultural, gender and age dynamics, that might impact how you greet and refer to clients. Building a client relationship also takes time, and you will not always be on a first name basis with your client.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>True or False: Business greetings have become more challenging during the Covid era, but a firm handshake is still the best way to greet your clients.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False False:  Covid-19 has impacted many ways that business is conducted including greetings such as handshakes. As noted on p.53, it may take years before some people feel comfortable shaking hands.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>True or False: It is important for the client to know your position/role in the firm and your involvement in their case file.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False It is important for the client to know your position/role in the firm and your involvement in their case file.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The non-directive style of interviewing is the only correct way of conducting an interview.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False It is important to be open and flexible in interacting with each client. A strategy that works well with one client may be disastrous with another. A non-directive style may allow the client room to communicate what is important to them, but it should never be directionless. Clients should always feel that the consultant has a plan and they should recognize that an interviewer\u2019s role is to secure information that will help to implement effective and timely representation that is responsive to a client's needs.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>It is not very important for the client to get your name correct; after all, after the initial interview, most follow up communication will be by email.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False As discussed chapter 3, when the interviewer ensures that they have the client's name right, including pronunciation, and that the client has the interviewer's name right, the interviewer acknowledges the importance of this relationship. It personalizes the process and is the first step to establishing rapport with the client.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>When a client arrives at your office for an interview it is best to:</p> <ul> <li> Allow administrative staff to escort the client to your office</li> <li> Wait 15 minutes before meeting the client so they think your office is busy</li> <li> Meet the client at reception and walk them to your office</li> <li> Have your client walk to your office on their own if they are a trusted and established client As stated on p. 52, it is always best to go and greet your client yourself even when dealing with established clients. This will show your client how important they are to you and your desire to build and maintain a strong relationship. There are also logistical, security and privacy considerations for greeting and escorting your client yourself to your office.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Narrow questions are the most effective way to get a client's story out.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False The statement is categorical and therefore false. In other words, narrow questions can be helpful, but we cannot categorically say that they are the best way to help the client tell their story. If a client is having trouble communicating and efforts to open the client up with broad questions are unsuccessful, then resorting to narrow (hopefully not leading) questions may be beneficial. So, for example, in relation to a car accident, it is perfectly fine to ask what colour the car that fled the scene was. It is not necessary to keep asking \u201cAnything else?\u201d until the client offers this information. Similarly, \u201cWhen did you first notice the vehicle that struck the pedestrian?\u201d is a relatively narrow question, as is \u201cDid you notice how many occupants there were in the vehicle?\u201d These are all questions that can be useful in a \u201cfunnel\u201d sequence, where the questioning starts from a very broad approach and continues with a sequence of progressively narrower questions.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>You don't have to worry about the accuracy or detail of information you obtain, because there is plenty of time to work that out as the file progresses.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False Accuracy is the lifeblood of legal representation. In addition to the potential that misleading information has to take the legal representation on a wild goose chase, inaccurate or misleading information can undermine the entire process. If the information is inaccurate, the wrong strategies may be implemented, and consultants will be surprised and disadvantaged by emerging facts that contradict what they have come to understand. If accuracy is not stressed in the early stages, the client picks up on the casual attitude and either adopts this approach or seeks legal representation elsewhere.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Which of the following is something that you should NOT do in winding down an interview:</p> <ul> <li> Summarize what the client has told you</li> <li> Send non-verbal cues, such as gathering paper, glancing at your watch, etc., that the interview is over</li> <li> Ask if there is anything else they want to add</li> <li> Discuss next steps Non-verbal cues such as gathering paper, pushing yourself away from the table, putting your pen away, looking at the clock, may be perceived as dismissive by clients. As Cochrane states (pp. 62-64), winding down the interview is an important part of the process of interviewing and sometimes very valuable information may come from this stage of the interview.  If clients feel through non-verbal cues that the interview is over, they be hesitant to share information that they have not previously brought up.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The interviewing technique of \"data mining\" involves</p> <ul> <li> Drilling down into a particular topic or area until all relevant information is obtained before moving on</li> <li> Covering a large topic by getting the basic information required and quickly moving on to the next issue</li> <li> Using narrow questions to determine the core legal issue involved</li> <li> Asking multiple questions about different topic areas Cochran discusses the importance of ensuring that you have gotten everything of value on a particular area before moving on (p. 60).  He calls this approach \"data mining\" which implies drilling down until all valuable information has been extracted.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> 4.2 Temporary Resident Status <ol> <li> <p>Melissa is a citizen of Cambodia.

Answer B has an element of truth. Highly educated immigrants do contribute to technological progress, but the article does not claim that immigrants are (on average) more educated than their native-born counterparts.

Anderson, Sharma, and Wright advance a no-borders politics that would overturn capitalism and nationalism and put into place \"different economic and social structures.\" They don't use the term \"socialism\", but they are clearly dedicated to liberating the global working class from exploitation, which could be understood under the umbrella term \"socialism.\"</p><ul> <li>liberals: Wellman, Carens, Caplan</li> <li>Socialism: Anderson, Sharma, Wright</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>In \u201cMigration: controlling the unsettled poor,\u201d Bridget Anderson surveys the history of British laws against vagrancy in order to\u2026</p> <ul> <li> \u2026undermine essentialist conceptions of the \u201cmigrant\u201d and \u201cthe citizen.\u201d</li> <li> \u2026highlight the hypocrisy of viewing work as a \u201cright,\u201d which is unavailable to migrants, but a \u201cduty,\u201d which is imposed upon citizens.</li> <li> \u2026show how national laws have always tried to coerce the poor, both locally and globally.</li> <li> All of the above D: Anderson\u2019s argument is complex, which is why she\u2019s written an entire book on it. Answers A, B, and C are all correct. She wants to soften the seemingly hard distinction between citizen and migrant. She argues that it is hypocritical to treat work as an unobtainable \u201cprivilege\u201d for some but an unavoidable \u201cduty\u201d for others.

A: The authors of \u201cWhy No Borders?\u201d do not hide their desire for radical change. They see open borders as incompatible with capitalism and nationalism (which rules out B).

The distinction matters because the criminalization of undocumented migrants effectively bars their path to citizenship.</li> <li> Undocumented migrants should be charged with a \"criminal offence\" if they cross the border illegally, but asylum seekers should only be charged with a \"civil violation\" as they have not broken any laws.</li> <li> A \"criminal offence\" implies a more dangerous threat to the public than a \"civil violation.\" Treating undocumented migration as a \"criminal offence\" fuels the myth that migrants are criminals.</li> <li> All of the above C: Answer A is incorrect because Ansari does not go into the details about how \"criminal offences\" and \"civil violations\" impact one's chances for citizenship.

C: Walzer is not for open borders, which rules out Answer A. Answer B best describes Carens\u2019s argument, not Walzer's. C is correct because Walzer argues for the \u201cforceful claim for admission\u201d of some refugees, but even then he thinks states are entitled to prioritize refugees who share their religion and political ideology. Answer D goes too far for Walzer who do think we have the obligation to help those in life-or-death situations.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>In \u201cMembership and Justice,\u201d Michael Walzer states unequivocally that his main concern is\u2026</p> <ul> <li> how to reconcile membership rights and the claims of justice.</li> <li> how to disentangle membership rights from the claims of justice.</li> <li> how to limit membership rights in favour of the claims of justice.</li> <li> how to write so opaquely that few readers can understand him. The first sentence of \u201cMembership and Justice\u201d reads: \u201cThe distribution of membership is not pervasively subject to the constraints of justice.\u201d Walzer doesn\u2019t want to reconcile membership rights and the claims of justice. He wants membership rights to take precedence. Answer D has some merit, but Answer B is Walzer\u2019s main concern.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>According to Andrew Griffith\u2019s \u201cHow to debate immigration issues in Canada,\u201d who is \u201cguilty\u201d of the following argumentative flaws: \u201cimmigration boosters,\u201d \u201cimmigration critics\u201d or both?</p> <ul> <li>both: Disregarding inconvenient evidence</li> <li>immigration critics: Citation of a contested Fraser Institute study</li> <li>immigration critics: The overuse of anecdotal evidence</li> <li>immigration boosters: Unwillingness to acknowledge concerns over shared values</li> <li>immigration boosters: Ignoring the importance of public support for certain issues Note: Notice that the \u201ccontested Fraser Institute study\u201d was written by Patrick Grady and Herbert Grubel, whose articles we covered in Unit 1.3</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>In \u201cMembership,\u201d Michael Walzer argues that which of the following offers the best analogy for the moral life of contemporary states?</p> <ul> <li> Neighbourhoods: \u201cOne ought to be able to go and come as one likes, provided one has the financial resources to do so.\u201d</li> <li> Clubs: \u201cLike clubs, states can regulate people coming in but they can\u2019t stop people from leaving.\u201d</li> <li> Families: \u201cLike families, the citizens of states are morally connected to people whom they did not voluntarily choose.\u201d</li> <li> Country clubs: \u201cYou are lucky if Daddy and Mommy got you into a good one. Otherwise you\u2019ll need to make a lot of money and put yourself on a waiting list.\u201d C: The analogy between states and neighbourhoods was part of \u201cclassical political economy\u201d in the nineteenth century. The economists argued \u201cfor perfect freedom of contract, without any political restraint\u201d (108). Walzer attacks the state-neighbourhood analogy, claiming that in the absence of state borders neighbourhoods themselves would become mini-states: \u201cTo tear down the walls of the state is not\u2026to create a world without walls, but rather to create a thousand petty fortresses\u201d (109).\u201d Walzer likes the state-club analogy with regard to the law, but he does not think it captures the \u201cmoral life\u201d of a state (110). Walzer likes the family-state analogy the best for describing the \u201cmoral life\u201d and refuge-granting dimensions of the state (111).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>In \u201cAliens and Citizens: The Case for Open Borders,\u201d Joseph H Carens argues that in the case of immigration to the United States, the difference between an \u201cideal theory\u201d and \u201cnonideal, real world\u201d is best characterized as:</p> <ul> <li> Nonexistent: ideal theory demands free migration, and the same would be necessary to ensure justice in the \u201cnonideal, real world\u201d of the United States.</li> <li> Nonexistent: ideal theory does not demand free migration, and nor does justice in the \u201cnonideal, real world\u201d of the United States.</li> <li> Limited: ideal theory demands free migration, but some level of border restrictions can be justly imposed in the pursuit/defense of public order. That being said, current restrictions in the United States far outstrip such a level.</li> <li> Significant: ideal theory demands free migration, but justice in the \u201cnonideal, real world\u201d of the United States needs to consider historical realities, which make strict border controls necessary to prevent the country being overwhelmed by immigrants and Americans from losing their wealth and culture. C: See page 122 for the summary of Carens\u2019 argument \u201cIn sum, nonideal theory provides more grounds for restricting immigration than ideal theory, but these grounds are severely limited.

Its primary source is Article 33(1) of the Geneva Convention: \u2018No Contracting State shall expel or return (\u201crefouler\u201d) a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion\u2019. In Canada, the right to non-refoulement has been incorporated into s. 115 of the IRPA.</li> <li>In the wake of increasing asylum claims in the 1980s, many governments have launched a series of \u201cinterdiction\u201d measures aimed at preventing or deterring would-be asylum seekers from reaching their territories.</li> <li>\u201cFirst country of arrival\u201d or \u201csafe third country agreements\u201d have been adopted in domestic refugee laws to bar access to asylum procedures to claimants who have traveled through a so-called safe third country en route to their destination.</li> <li>The Canada\u2013US Safe Third Country Agreement was signed in 2002 as part of the US-Canada Smart Border Action Plan and implemented in 2004 with the formal designation of the United States. On March 24, 2023, Canada and the United States announced that, as of March 25, 2023, the STCA and the Additional Protocol would be expanded across the entire land border, including internal waterways.</li> <li>There are two pathways to receiving protection in Canada:<ul> <li>an application for refugee protection, determined by the Refugee Protection Division and the Refugee Appeal Division of the IRB (IRPA, s. 95(1)(b)); or</li> <li>an application for protection determined by an officer of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, in some cases together with a delegate of the Minister, as part of a \u201cpre-removal risk assessment\u201d (PRRA) (IRPA, s. 95(1)(c))</li> </ul> </li> <li>The requirements of the refugee definition as set out in s. 96: three basic elements of the refugee definition: inclusion, exclusion and cessation; as well as the scope of protection afforded under s. 97 of the IRPA for individuals who don\u2019t meet the s. 96 requirements.</li> <li>The Supreme Court of Canada\u2019s decision in Canada (AG) v. Ward, [1993] 2 SCR 689 is a foundational case on the test for determining a \u201cwell founded fear of persecution\u201d in order to make a claim for refugee status. Among other important rulings, the Court held that persecution need not originate from the state, and that mere inability to provide protection is sufficient to establish a claim for persecution. The Court also offered guidance on the meaning of \u201cparticular social group\u201d within the refugee definition of the Convention.</li> <li>Refugee protection is not necessarily intended to be permanent. Refugees may face the loss of their protected person status if they are not yet a Canadian citizen and the IRB decides that they have re-established themselves in their home country or \u2018re-availed\u201d themselves of their home country\u2019s protection. The details are set out in section 108 of the IRPA.</li> <li>There are two main classes of refugees under the Refugee and Humanitarian Resettlement Program: The Convention refugee abroad class and the humanitarian \u2013 protected abroad class.</li> <li>Resettled refugees come to Canada in the following ways:<ul> <li>through the federal Government-Assisted Refugee (GAR) Program (which includes the Joint Assistance Sponsorship Program)</li> <li>with the assistance of civil society groups through the Private Sponsorship of Refugees (PSR) Program, or</li> <li>through the Blended Visa Office\u2013Referred Program, which combines government and private support</li> </ul> </li> <li>Using a trauma-informed approach to interviewing clients is beneficial to both the legal practitioner and the clients for many of the following reasons:<ul> <li>Results in better quality and quantity of information obtained</li> <li>Helps clients feel empowered</li> <li>Minimizes the risks of re-traumatization</li> </ul> </li> <li>The Four Rs of a trauma-informed approach:      </li> </ul> 6.2: Detention &amp; removal <ul> <li>There is no statutory limit (or even soft law limit) to the length of immigration detention in Canada (90 days for France; while for EU member states, the upper limit is 18 months).</li> <li>In the absence of actual law reform, the grounds upon which detention is mandated remains the same and judicial oversight remains limited. The Federal Court considers only the \u201creasonableness\u201d of detention review decisions, and frequently stays release decisions and upholds continued detention orders.</li> <li>Section 55 of IRPA sets out the grounds for detaining non-citizens with a warrant, without a warrant, upon entry, and upon designation as an irregular arrival.<ul> <li>IRPA, s 55(1) gives immigration officers the discretion to issue a warrant for the arrest and detention of permanent residents or foreign nationals who the officer has reasonable grounds to believe are inadmissible and are a danger to the public or are unlikely to appear for examination, for an admissibility hearing, for removal from Canada, or at a proceeding that could lead to the making of a removal order by the Minister under s 44(2).</li> <li>IRPA, s 55(2) allows officers to arrest foreign nationals (other than protected persons)<ul> <li>(a) who the officer has reasonable grounds to believe are inadmissible and are a danger to the public or are unlikely to appear for examination, an admissibility hearing, removal from Canada, or at a proceeding that could lead to the making of a removal order by the Minister under s 44(2); or</li> <li>(b) if the officer is not satisfied of the identity of the foreign nationals in the course of any procedure under this Act.</li> </ul> </li> <li>IRPA, s 55(3) allows for the detention of permanent residents or foreign nationals upon entry to Canada if the officer<ul> <li>(a) considers it necessary to do so in order for the examination to be completed; or</li> <li>(b) has reasonable grounds to suspect that the permanent residents or foreign nationals are inadmissible on grounds of security, violating human or international rights, serious criminality, criminality, or organized criminality.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Finally, s 55(3.1) requires the mandatory detention upon entry into Canada of foreign nationals designated as \u201cirregular arrivals\u201d or the arrest and detention without a warrant of such designated persons after entry.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Separate detention provisions exist for persons who are subject to a security certificate. These persons may be arrested and detained upon issuance of a warrant if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person is a danger to national security or to the safety of any person or is unlikely to appear at a proceeding or for removal (IRPA, s 81).</li> <li>Where a person has been detained, notice is immediately provided to the ID of the IRB, the body that is competent to review the reasons for detention. Except for designated foreign nationals, the first review of the continued reasons for detention will occur within 48 hours; the second at least once within 7 days, and then at least once during each 30-day period.</li> <li>Section 58 of the IRPA specifies when a person held in detention should not be released: 58 (1) The Immigration Division shall order the release of a permanent resident or a foreign national unless it is satisfied, taking into account prescribed factors, that<ul> <li>(a) they are a danger to the public;</li> <li>(b) they are unlikely to appear for examination, an admissibility hearing, removal from Canada, or at a proceeding that could lead to the making of a removal order by the Minister under subsection 44(2);</li> <li>(c) the Minister is taking necessary steps to inquire into a reasonable suspicion that they are inadmissible on grounds of security, violating human or international rights, serious criminality, criminality or organized criminality;</li> <li>(d) the Minister is of the opinion that the identity of the foreign national\u2014other than a designated foreign national who was 16 years of age or older on the day of the arrival that is the subject of the designation in question\u2014has not been, but may be, established and they have not reasonably cooperated with the Minister by providing relevant information for the purpose of establishing their identity or the Minister is making reasonable efforts to establish their identity; or</li> <li>(e) the Minister is of the opinion that the identity of the foreign national who is a designated foreign national and who was 16 years of age or older on the day of the arrival that is the subject of the designation in question has not been established.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Sections 244 to 249 of the Regulations specify the factors that must be taken into account when a decision to detain or to continue detention is being made on various grounds. The constitutionality of a similar detention review regime that applied these factors at regular intervals\u2014despite the fact that there is no upper limit on the duration of detention [Charkaoui v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 2007 SCC 9].</li> <li>Several policy documents also guide detention practices:<ul> <li>Enforcement Manual on Detention, which provides guidance to officers on the reasons for and length of detention, and alternatives to detention: \u201cENF 20: Detention,\u201d Online PDF</li> <li>Enforcement Manual on Deposits and Guarantees, which provides guidance to officers in relation to the deposits and guarantees that may be required for a detainee\u2019s release: \u201cENF 8: Deposits and Guarantees\u201d Online PDF</li> <li>Enforcement Manual on Alternatives to Detention, which provides guidance to officers in relation to the conditions that can be imposed on individuals: \u201cENF 34: Alternatives to Detention\u201d: Online PDF</li> <li>The Immigration Division Rules, SOR/2002-229, which includes the rules applicable to detention review hearings before the Immigration Division;</li> <li>the IRB\u2019s Chairperson Guideline 2: Detention, which provides guidance to the Immigration Division on detention review and release: Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, \u201cChairperson Guideline 2: Detention\u201d (April 2021), Online.</li> </ul> </li> <li>For the vast majority of people, the reason they are detained is flight risk pursuant to s 58(1)(b) of the IRPA.</li> <li>Federal Court of Appeal\u2019s decision in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Thanabalasingham 2004 FCA 4 Online, is still considered a leading precedent on the approach to this question. \" However, previous decisions to detain the individual must be considered at subsequent reviews and the Immigration Division must give clear and compelling reasons for departing from previous decisions.\"</li> <li>Section 58(1) of the IRPA provides that the onus to justify detention remains with the Minister at each subsequent review.</li> <li>Supreme Court\u2019s decision in Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v Chhina 2019 SCC 29 (CanLII), Online. Prior to the ruling in Chhina, the law was unclear as to whether provincial superior courts had the jurisdiction to hear applications for habeas corpus from immigration detainees, due to the existence of an alternative remedy under the IRPA. In its ruling in Chhina, the Supreme Court identified some important gaps in the IRPA\u2019s detention review scheme, concluding that the scheme is not equally as broad and advantageous as habeas corpus.</li> <li>What is a Security Certificate? The security certificate process within the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) is an immigration proceeding for the purpose of removing from Canada non-Canadians who are inadmissible for reasons of national security, violating human or international rights, or involvement in organized or serious crimes.

The assessment of well-founded fear has both an objective and subjective component, but one is not more important than the other.

If the persecution feared is not based on any of the enumerated grounds, then the individual is not a Convention refugee. Victims of ordinary crime do not fit the definition of a Convention refugee. Victims of some types of crimes may be able to claim persecution based on membership in a particular social group only if they can show a lack of state protection, such as victims of domestic violence, or victims of ethnic violence. Further, claims based on credible and individualized threats may be able to satisfy the requirements for protection pursuant to s. 97 of the IRPA (provided that all the elements of s. 97(1)(b) are met) as the risk is not indiscriminate or random.

Anna was sponsored as a permanent resident by her abusive spouse and is seeking your advice on her immigration status now that they are separated.  In the interview, Anna starts out well, but becomes incoherent when it comes to discussing the details of her relationship. When you ask a question about how long she was married, she begins to describe the decorations and bridesmaid dresses at her wedding.  When you ask her for details about the separation, she begins to describe her new neighborhood she is currently living in. Which of the following responses to trauma do you recognize in Anna's example:</p> <ul> <li> Non-linear narratives</li> <li> Patchy Memories</li> <li> Denial</li> <li> Emotional Swings A typical response to trauma may be that a client skips from one topic to another rather quickly.

Also, the duty to give reasons will vary according to the type of decision. However, the absence of reasons when circumstances dictate they are required, may serve as a basis for review under the duty of fairness</li> <li>Sources of Procedural Fairness:<ul> <li>The Citizenship Act: prescribes application procedures in Part V of the Act while Part II of the Act prescribes fairly elaborate procedures for citizenship revocation.</li> <li>The IRPA:<ul> <li>largely silent as to the procedures to be followed for most immigration matters.</li> <li>An important exception concerns the IRB.</li> </ul> </li> <li>the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR) and the Citizenship Regulations do not include detailed procedural rules. However, the IRPR does impose some broad procedural parameters, including the default written nature of the hearing, and the right to representation.</li> <li>policy instruments, including guidelines, program delivery instructions, operational manuals and operational bulletins, tend to be the most important source of procedural entitlements, generating the right under the legitimate expectations doctrine.<ul> <li>An important policy instrument in relation to all types of immigration and citizenship decision-making - outside the IRB context - is IRCC's operational instructions on procedural fairness.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The common law or judge-made principles are another important source of procedural rights.</li> <li>The Constitution and the Charter.</li> </ul> </li> <li>One important exception to the right to be heard: administrative decisions of a legislative nature may not engage any entitlement to procedural fairness.

In contrast, a multifunctional structure creates an appearance of bias when those who are responsible for recommending or prosecuting proceedings against a person are also involved in deciding whether to take away the person\u2019s rights.

As such, judges prefer not to give off the impression that there are potential systematic problems\u201d.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Why, in Kozak v Canada, did the Federal Court of Appeal find that the IRB's lead case strategy was institutionally biased?</p> <ul> <li> The \"lead case\" idea was inherently biased</li> <li> The evidence established that the IRB members involved in preparing the lead case were racist</li> <li> The cumulative effect of the facts of the case pointed to bias</li> <li> The facts disclosed a clear breach of Charter rights Kozak v Canada, at para 60: \"Nonetheless, despite the absence of a 'smoking gun', I have concluded on the basis of the entire factual matrix of this case that a reasonable person who had considered every aspect of the matter and had thought it through carefully, would think that the hearing panel was biased and was not acting independently when it rejected the appellants' claims for refugee status.\"</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>What is generally the appropriate remedy when a reasonable apprehension of bias is substantiated on judicial review?</p> <ul> <li> The decision is invalidated, if it is likely that the substance of the decision was impacted</li> <li> The decision is invalidated, if it is certain that the substance of the decision was impacted</li> <li> The decision is invalidated, unless the efficiency of the administrative decision-maker would be unduly impacted</li> <li> The decision is invalidated If there was a RAB, the decision cannot stand.

Near the end of the hearing, you become aware that 10 years earlier, the presiding member, Luis Gonzalez, attended a meeting where the case before the tribunal was briefly discussed. At that time he was a junior lawyer with the Immigration Division of the Department of Justice. You raise the matter but Mr. Gonzlez explains he has no recollection of this meeting or the case from that time. The hearing is almost finished. He advises that he does not feel it is in the best interest of your client or the Minister to step aside.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False As noted in Nastasi, c. 5 at p. 114, if the adjudicator feels that they have no actual bias and any appearance of bias will not constitute a \u201creasonable apprehension\u201d of bias, they may decide it is in the public interest for them to continue. While there is some dispute as to whether an adjudicator can present facts in his or her own defence, in the case of Weywaykum the Supreme Court of Canada permitted Justice Binnie to file a statement saying he had no recollection of involvement in a case he had played a minor role in some 15 years earlier.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The Supreme Court of Canada has endorsed the idea that administrative tribunals are constitutionally required to be fully independent from the government in the same manner as the judiciary.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False The Supreme Court of Canada rejected the idea that administrative tribunals are constitutionally required to be independent in the case Ocean Port Hotel Ltd. v. British Columbia (General Manager, Liquor Control and Licensing Branch). The Court held that there is a fundamental distinction between tribunals and courts. Tribunals are created precisely for the purpose of implementing government policy. Nevertheless, tribunals, in contrast to department officials, may enjoy some of the hallmarks of administrative independence, subject to their enabling statute. As noted in Module 3.2 (in onQ), a higher level of independence is required where a decision affects a party\u2019s Charter rights.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>You are representing Raj at an admissibility hearing at the IRB. The Minister is alleging that there are reasonable grounds to believe Raj poses a threat to national security. During a recess, Raj returns from the washroom distraught. Raj overheard the presiding Member speaking on the phone in the hallway. The Member said \u201cI knew from the moment I saw that no good gangster in my hearing room today was pure trouble.\u201d What is your very next step?</p> <ul> <li> Refer the client to a lawyer to initiate an application for leave and judicial review on grounds of bias</li> <li> Defer consideration of the bias question until after the hearing concludes</li> <li> Bring a motion for the presiding member to step down and ask for a ruling by the member</li> <li> None of the above Certain kinds of behaviour toward the parties during a hearing and even outside the hearing room may suggest that a decision maker does not have an open mind. An adjudicator expressing opinions about the issues in the case before all the evidence and arguments have been heard could lead a reasonable and well-informed person to assume that the decision-maker is biased. The hurdle to overcome with these facts is that it seems Raj was the only person who overheard the Member\u2019s statement. Nevertheless, the courts usually consider a party that does not raise an allegation of bias during the hearing to have waived the right to argue it in court. So it is important to raise the issue of an appearance of bias as early as possible. See Nastasi, c. 5, at p. 113.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>According to Alyssa Clutterbuck, what is intersectionality?</p> <ul> <li> A way of thinking about stereotypes</li> <li> A theory that illuminates multiple and simultaneous sites of oppression and accounts for Baker\u2019s multidimensional experience of disability and race</li> <li> A theory that helps understand why children\u2019s interests should be a primary consideration in H &amp; C decision-making</li> <li> A and B Per Clutterbuck at 57: Disabled women of colour\u2019s experiences of discrimination pose unique challenges to law. The multidimensionality of their subordination is best understood through the lens of intersectionality, a theory introduced by Kimberl\u00e9 Crenshaw that illuminates the multiple and simultaneous sites of subordination and the limits of feminist, antiracist, and other critical discourses. The theory has provided grounds for scholarly writing on women of colour, queer and trans people of colour, and groups with multiple and simultaneous experiences of oppression and structural marginalization.\u201d</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>You are waiting for the elevator with your client, a refugee claimant, on the main floor of the building of the IRB to return to the hearing room after the lunch break. When the doors open, you see the presiding Member from the hearing chatting and appearing very familiar with the Minister's counsel from your client's hearing. As soon as they see you, their conversation stops. Meanwhile, you do a quick Google search on each of their names and learn that prior to their respective appointments, they were both associates of the same law firm. What should you do?</p> <ul> <li> Raise reasonable apprehension of bias immediately</li> <li> Apply for internal review, then raise reasonable apprehension of bias</li> <li> Refer them to a lawyer, who will sue the Member</li> <li> None of the above Alleging that a tribunal member is or appears to be biased is a serious matter, and bias allegations should not be made lightly. Aside from any other reasons to exercise caution, the first rule of good advocacy is to not alienate the decision maker. Moreover, the courts have made it clear that restraint must be exercised when making such allegations. However, in this instance, a reviewing court would likely view the decision maker's close association with the Minister's counsel, a person whose interests may be affected by the outcome of the case, as rising to the level of disqualifying bias. Where it is necessary to initiate a motion on apprehension of bias, as is the case here, it is important to do so as soon as the question of bias or conflict of interest arises. The courts generally consider that a party who fails to raise an allegation of bias during a hearing to have waived the right to argue it subsequently in court.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Why does Clutterbuck say that Baker\u2019s appeal was not as much of a success as it initially appeared?</p> <ul> <li> Because Mavis Baker was deported</li> <li> Because the Officer who made the decision in her case was not disciplined</li> <li> Because the Supreme Court failed to grant her residence application</li> <li> Because the Supreme Court failed to grapple with the issue Mavis Baker\u2019s intersecting vulnerabilities See, Clutterbuck, at p 63: \u201cI argue that Baker is an apt illustration of the inability of courts to recognize how people with intersecting vulnerabilities are targeted and attacked by administrative systems. I apply Spade\u2019s notion of administrative violence to understand the violence committed against Ms. Baker by Canada\u2019s immigration system and the epistemic violence of legal approaches that privilege procedural questions and ignore the centrality of race, gender, and disability as justiciable issues.\u201d See also page 66: \u201cThe facts in Baker provided an opportune moment for the SCC to conceptualize racism, sexism, classism, and ableism as a feature in attitudes among certain personnel in Canada\u2019s immigration system. However, the Court did not engage these central aspects of the case, sweeping their possible justiciability under the proverbial rug.\u201d</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>If the presiding member in a matter before the IRB rules against your motion for their recusal on the basis of bias, you should immediately refer the client to a lawyer to seek judicial review of the member\u2019s decision to continue.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False If the member does not agree that their participation will result in reasonable apprehension of bias, it is not necessary to immediately seek judicial review of the member\u2019s decision to continue. A party\u2019s continued participation in the hearing will not be considered a waiver of the right to raise the issue in later court proceedings, since the issue was raised during the hearing. See Nastasi, c. 5 at p. 113.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Your client Marcel has been having a tough time recently, and you notice that they are very nervous about their IRB hearing. During the hearing, the presiding member adopts a somewhat aggressive tone with some of the questions posed to your client. You agree that the Member\u2019s tone has been a bit rude, but your client is really upset. These facts suggest that Marcel has a strong basis for asking the member to stand aside on the basis of reasonable apprehension of bias.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False the threshold for bias is high. Bias must be obvious to the reasonable person and must be grounded in evidence. Remarks that are rude will likely not meet this high threshold \u2013 see de Grandpr\u00e9\u2019s dissent in Committee for Justice and Liberty v National Energy Board at para. 395. At the same time, if Marcel\u2019s growing anxiety is negatively impacting his ability to provide testimony, a brief mid-hearing \u201cconference\u201d can be requested with the Board member to draw the Member\u2019s attention to Marcel\u2019s condition and request appropriate accommodations. Section 10.1 of Chairperson Guideline 8: Procedures with respect to vulnerable persons appearing before the IRB (which you will learn about in the Refugee Protection course) confirms: \u201cThe IRB ensures that all those who appear at its hearings or other proceedings are questioned with sensitivity and respect. This obligation is all the more important in the case of vulnerable persons. In probing the information provided by the person, the IRB will attempt to avoid traumatizing or re-traumatizing the vulnerable person.\u201d</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>You are appearing before at the Immigration and Refugee Board. At the beginning of your client's hearing, the presiding member exchanges pleasant greetings with the Minister's representative. You overhear them chatting about the weather and they seem friendly. What should you do?</p> <ul> <li> Warn the Minister's representative of a possible conflict of interest</li> <li> Make notes about the incident to raise an allegation of reasonable apprehension of bias arguments in case you have to appeal the decision</li> <li> Nothing \u2013 it is okay to be friendly in this professional setting</li> <li> Immediately request that the Member recuse himself from the proceedings due to personal relationship While a close relationship with a person whose interests may be affected by the outcome of the case may give rise to an appearance of bias, friendly banter in the hearing room likely does not cross the line so long as the decision-maker is not intervening in the hearing process in a way that persistently favours one party over another. A reviewing court is not likely to consider the presiding Member's conduct in this scenario as rising to the level of reasonable apprehension of bias.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Your client has been detained for 6 months now. They have a detention review hearing at the IRB. Your client receives an unfavourable decision \u2013 they will remain in detention. One week later, you receive an anonymous letter advising that before the decision was released, it was reviewed and changed by the Chairperson. The decision had initially directed that your client should be released. The facts as presented constitute an impermissible incursion on adjudicative autonomy.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False Tribunal members can seek advice from agency staff and colleagues. However, they must make the final decision voluntarily (see, Module 3.3 in onQ: \u201cConsultation and Advice\u201d). The Chairperson\u2019s intervention likely constituted institutional bias. See also, Nastasi, c. 5, p. 112; and c. 4, pp. 94-98.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Tribunals are not expected to have the same degree of independence as courts.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False unless their enabling statutes stipulate otherwise, tribunals are not fully independent from government. They are part of the executive branch and are appointed by it.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Why does Will Tao suggest that counsel should not be afraid to raise reasonable apprehension of bias?</p> <ul> <li> Because it is easy to establish on judicial review</li> <li> Because arguments about reasonable apprehension of bias often succeed</li> <li> Because the system can be inherently biased and it is good to point it out Per Tao: \u201cCounsel should not also be dissuaded by the high-bar or the fear of being criticized, for putting together well-thought out criticisms of the structure of immigration-decision making that i[s] inherently biased. I do see a room for the argument \u2013 even if we never have another Baker-like decision that spells out the bias so clearly and unequivocally.\u201d</li> </ul> </li> </ol> 3.4 Judicial Review <ol> <li> <p>Your former client Roberto contacts you with good news. On judicial review, the Federal Court just quashed the decision that denied him refugee status. Roberto no longer needs your help, because his refugee status is now granted.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False While there are exceptions (including in the Vavilov case itself), courts more commonly send the matter back for redetermination. The court\u2019s judgement should be reviewed to identify whether the matter was directed back to the IRB for redetermination. See Module 3.4 in onQ.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>You are an RCIC representing Salem who has been detained by CBSA for almost a year. Salem has been denied release in every preceding detention review hearing before the Immigration Division of the IRB. He is desperate to be released. You are aware that decisions of the Immigration Division could be judicially reviewed in Federal Court. A habeas corpus application may offer another avenue for challenging the legality of Salem\u2019s continuing detention. What should you do?</p> <ul> <li> Advise Salem that he should consider retaining a lawyer \u2013 you are not qualified to represent him before the courts</li> <li> Help Salem apply for habeas corpus</li> <li> Help Salem apply for judicial review</li> <li> B and C Regulated immigration consultants are not authorized to represent clients before the courts, so Salem should be referred to a lawyer to discuss his options.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Which one of the following circumstances is NOT an exception to reasonableness as the default standard of review on judicial review:</p> <ul> <li> when there are constitutional questions</li> <li> when there are serious issues of credibility</li> <li> when their general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole</li> <li> questions regarding the jurisdictional boundaries between two or more administrative bodies</li> </ul> <p>In Vavilov, the Supreme Court clarified that the presumption of reasonableness review (for judicial review as opposed to statutory appeals), may be rebutted:</p> <ul> <li>where the legislature has indicated that a different standard should apply; or</li> <li>where the rule of law requires review on a correctness standard.</li> </ul> <p>The Supreme Court further confirmed that this will be the case for questions that fall within one of three categories:</p> <ul> <li>constitutional questions, including the constitutional division of powers, whether provisions of a decision-maker\u2019s enabling statute infringe the Charter;</li> <li>and general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole, which require uniform and consistent answers as a result of their impact on the administration of justice as a whole.</li> </ul> <p>The assessment of credibility does not fall within one of these categorical exceptions.</p> </li> <li> <p>There has been significant disagreement within the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) concerning the degree of risk faced by an ethnic minority in country X. About a third of the decisions dealing with appeals from country X in the past six months have been based on clear findings about the deteriorating human rights situation in the country, while the balance have found that state protection for the minority population remains adequate. You represented Ana in her appeal before the RAD. Ana fears return to country X. Her appeal is rejected and she has retained new counsel to pursue a judicial review application. The existence of internal disagreement within the RAD will rebut the presumption of reasonableness in Ana\u2019s case.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False As noted by Deanna Okun-Nachoff (in conversation with Steven Meurrens) in \u201cBorderlines Podcast Episode 35 \u2013 The Implications of the Supreme Court of Canada Decision in Vavilov\u201d, the Supreme Court clarified in Vavilov that persistent discord within an administrative agency does not change the degree of deference of afforded to the agency\u2019s decision @ mins 21:00 \u2013 24:12.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Anna\u2019s application for refugee status in Canada was denied and her appeal to the Refugee Appeal Division was rejected as well. She has exhausted internal appeals within the IRB and has retained counsel to initiate leave and judicial review in Federal Court. Her lawyer has reviewed the Member\u2019s reasons for decision and the full contents of Anna\u2019s case file at the IRB and believes that their decision was legally incorrect and based on a misinterpretation of key evidence. Which of the following should be the lawyer\u2019s argument in relation to standard of review?</p> <ul> <li> Argue for review on a correctness standard, because then the Court can find the decision was wrong and substitute their own decision</li> <li> No need to address standard of review at all</li> <li> Concede that the applicable standard of review is reasonableness and focus the argument on why the decision was unreasonable</li> <li> Argue for review on a correctness standard because of the error of law and focus the argument on why the decision at issue was incorrect A legal error is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness. Anna\u2019s lawyer should focus on the decision actually made and the justification offered for it in order to construct an argument that the decision was unreasonable per Vavilov.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The Supreme Court found the Immigration Officer\u2019s decision in Mavis Baker\u2019s case unreasonable because:</p> <ul> <li> the reasons for decision failed to give sufficient weight or consideration to the hardship that a return to Jamaica might cause Ms. Baker</li> <li> the decision was contrary to the guidelines issued by the Minister</li> <li> the failure to give serious weight and consideration to the interests of the children</li> <li> all of the above See, Baker, paras. 63-74.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The prerogative writ that is used to prevent an administrative decision-maker from doing something that it is not permitted to do, before it does so, is certiorari.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False The prerogative writ that is used to prevent an administrative decision-maker from doing something that it is not permitted to do is prohibition.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>When the first instance decision contains a factual error, it is not a guarantee of a successful outcome on judicial review.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False Section 18.1(4)(d) of the Federal Courts Act requires that the decision-maker must have \u201cbased its decision or order on an erroneous finding of fact that is made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it\u2019. As noted in Module 3.4 in onQ, the bar is very high for overturning factual errors. Examples included where the decision maker based their decision on a finding fact for which there was no evidence or contrary evidence; or the decision maker ignored evidence directly contrary to the decision reached.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov concerned:</p> <ul> <li> the review of a decision by the Immigration Division of the IRB finding that Mr. Vavilov was inadmissible to Canada as the dependents of foreign nationals who had engaged in espionage against Canada\u2019s interests</li> <li> the review of a decision by the Immigration Appeal Division of the IRB that removal order against Mr. Vavilov should be upheld</li> <li> the review of a decision by the Registrar of Citizenship to cancel Mr. Vavilov\u2019s Canadian citizenship</li> <li> the review of a decision by a Minister\u2019s delegate to issue a Canadian passport to Mr. Vavilov and his brother As noted in Module 3.4 in onQ, Vavilov involved the review of the decision of the Registrar of citizenship to cancel Vavilov\u2019s Canadian citizenship. The Registrar held that he was not a Canadian citizen because, although he was born in Canada and would for this reason normally be entitled to citizenship under s. 3(1)(a) of the Citizenship Act, his parents, who had operated in Canada as Russian spies, were at that time \u201cemployee[s] of a foreign government\u201d within the meaning of s. 3(2)(a) of the Act.

What rights were engaged?</p> <ul> <li> Section 9 \u2013 because his unlawful detention was arbitrary</li> <li> Section 15 \u2013 because his rights to equality were breached</li> <li> Section 7 \u2013 because section 248 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations breached his right to liberty</li> <li> Sections 7 and 9 because Mr. Taino's ongoing detention breached his right to liberty and was arbitrary. The Immigration Division ordered Mr. Taino's release on the basis that his ongoing detention violated both sections 7 and 9 of the Charter and was not saved by section 1. It is interesting to note, however, that on judicial review, the Federal Court determined that the matter should be decided by applying principles of administrative law and statutory interpretation. The scheme was ultimately upheld as Charter compliant. The detention was not long enough to engage section 9 of the Charter [Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v Taino, 2020 FC 427 (CanLII), &lt;https://canlii.ca/t/j611t&gt;].</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Your client is a business class immigrant and owns a parcel of land within the city limits that was subject to an expropriation order. The Expropriations Tribunal upheld the expropriation to facilitate the construction of an extension to the city\u2019s subway system. This Tribunal is exercising a statutory power under the provincial Expropriations Act. Your client did not receive notice of the hearing before the Tribunal. She learned that a hearing had been convened when she received a decision letter in the mail. The consequence of this decision is that your client\u2019s plans to build a shopping mall on the property have been upended, resulting in significant financial losses. Your client intends to invoke a provision in the Expropriations Act to request that the Tribunal reconsider the matter. For the reconsideration hearing, the Tribunal can apply the following authorities to this matter:</p> <ul> <li> Common law</li> <li> Section 7 of the Charter</li> <li> Relevant provisions of the Expropriations Act</li> <li> A and C The Charter will not be engaged, because your client\u2019s rights to life, liberty, and security of the person are not at stake. Your client\u2019s financial loss does not come within the ambit of s. 7.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>What remedy is a tribunal not permitted to award under section 24(1) of the Charter?</p> <ul> <li> Declare a law unconstitutional</li> <li> Overrule a decision-maker</li> <li> Refuse to follow a procedure that is contrary to the Charter</li> <li> Refuse to apply a law that contravenes the Charter Section 52(1) of the Constitution Act, 1982 is the source of authority for courts and many tribunals to declare a law or provision to be unconstitutional. See, Nastasi, c. 3, p. 77. Note, as well, that it is only by obtaining a declaration of invalidity by a superior court that a litigant can establish the general invalidity of the legislation for all future cases.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Which of the following would not be bound by the Charter?</p> <ul> <li> A private body carrying out a public policy</li> <li> A community college with a board appointed by the provincial government</li> <li> A court hearing a criminal trial</li> <li> A federally incorporated business The Charter applies to governments, government ministries/departments, agencies, boards, commissions, and maybe some bodies that have a public function and receive public funding, including hospitals.

The video proceeds to cite the examples of rulings on same sex marriage and internet privacy.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>In Law Society of British Columbia v Mangat, the Supreme Court of Canada found that immigration as a subject matter fell within provincial and federal jurisdiction. Why, then, did it assign responsibility for the matter to the federal government?</p> <ul> <li> Because it is more efficient to only have one level of government legislating in the area</li> <li> Because the Court trusts the federal government more</li> <li> Because the paramountcy doctrine says the federal government\u2019s historical involvement in relation to naturalization and aliens must be respected</li> <li> Because the paramountcy doctrine stipulates that the federal government prevails where there is conflict between federal and provincial legislation Section 95 of the Constitution Act, 1867 grants to both the federal and provincial legislatures the jurisdiction to legislate in relation to immigration. Where there is an operational conflict, the federal government\u2019s jurisdiction will prevail. See, Aiken, Grey, c. 4.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>In Singh v Minister of Employment and Immigration, which of the following was/were the Court\u2019s reason/s in holding that the procedures for determining refugee status violated the applicant\u2019s section 7 rights?</p> <ul> <li> The Charter applies to every person present in Canada, regardless of their immigration status</li> <li> The concept of \u201cfundamental justice\u201d in section 7 requires that a refugee claimant have an opportunity to state their case and know the case they have to meet; the procedures failed to provide that opportunity</li> <li> The scheme violated procedural fairness because refused claimants were not provided access to a statutory appeal on the merits of a refused refugee claim</li> <li> A and B The Supreme Court held the Charter applies to every person physically present in Canada and that \u201cfundamental justice\u201d, at a minimum, incorporates the common law rules of procedural fairness, requiring the refugee claimant to be afforded an opportunity to state their case and know the case the case they have to meet. Justice Wilson also expressed the view that \u201cwhere a serious issue of credibility is involved, fundamental justice requires that credibility be determined on the basis of an oral hearing.\u201d See, Aiken, Grey, c. 4.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Your client recently attended an admissibility hearing at the IRB to determine whether they are a national security risk. During a break in the hearing, your client overhears the presiding member chatting with a colleague in the hallway. The member remarked that your client \u201cis certainly a hoodlum and a bad actor \u2013 it is plain as day.\u201d What should you do?</p> <ul> <li> Swiftly initiate a notice of constitutional question and raise s.15 of the Charter as this is discrimination based on race, an enumerated ground</li> <li> Request that the presiding member step down on the basis of reasonable apprehension of bias.</li> <li> Suggest your client retain counsel to begin a Charter claim in court against the Member.</li> <li> All of the above This is indicative of an apprehension of bias, not a Charter breach \u2013 as there is no action or legislation that interferes with your client\u2019s s.15 rights. Initiating a motion for recusal \u2013 that the member step down \u2013 on the basis of reasonable apprehension of bias, is the recommended course of action.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>True or false: The Supreme Court of Canada has endorsed the application of the Oakes test, developed for evaluating the compliance of laws with the Charter, to determine the propriety of discretionary immigration decisions.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False The Supreme Court of Canada has refused to apply the Oakes test, developed for evaluating the compliance of laws with the Charter, to determine the propriety of discretionary administrative decisions, including discretionary immigration decisions. The alternative approach chosen by the Supreme Court of Canada was to analyze whether the administrative decision was reasonable overall. Included in this analysis would be a consideration of whether the decision took Charter values sufficiently into account. This involves weighing whether the decision achieves a reasonable balance between furthering the objectives of the statutory regime under which the decision is made and the values underlying the Charter. This balancing exercise must ensure that the Charter protections are limited no more than is necessary to achieve the statutory objectives that the discretionary decision-maker is required to pursue. See, Nastasi, c. 3, pp. 73-74.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>True or false: Provincial influence in relation to immigration matters has been waning in recent years.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False As noted by Mireille Paquet (cited in Aiken, Grey, c. 4), provincial influence over immigration matters has been growing, resulting in a more crowded and contested regulatory sphere.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>True or false: the remedies tribunals can award under section 24(1) of the Charter are not the same as the remedies available to courts.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False Section 24(1) allows a court of competent jurisdiction to provide any remedy that it considers \u201cappropriate and just in the circumstances\u201d. Some tribunals are deemed \u201ccourts of competent jurisdiction\u201d while others are not (see Nastasi, c. 3, p. 75). Although this is a potentially broad power, in practice, tribunals, as creatures of statute, can only award remedies that are provided for in their enabling statute. Absent a statutory power to grant remedies such as damages or costs, a tribunal does not have jurisdiction to grant these remedies (in contrast to actual courts). See, Nastasi, c.3, p. 74.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>True or false: to successfully demonstrate that an immigration rule violates section 15 of the Charter, an applicant only has to establish that: the statute, program, policy, or activity results in a disadvantage being imposed on an enumerated ground.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False to successfully demonstrate that an immigration rule violates section 15 of the Charter, an applicant must establish two elements: that the statute, program, policy, or activity results in a disadvantage being imposed on an enumerated or analogous ground; and this disadvantage results from discrimination, which the Supreme Court has identified as \u201cthe perpetuation of prejudice or stereotyping.\u201d See, Nastasti, c. 3, p. 69.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>True or false: immigration status qualifies as an analogous ground under section 15 of the Charter.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False As per Toussaint v Canada (Attorney General), 2011 FCA 213, Stratas JA held that immigration status does not qualify as an analogous ground under section 15 of the Charter. The reasons were: \u201cimmigration status is not a [characteristic] that we cannot change. It is not immutable or changeable only at unacceptable cost to personal identity\u201d\u2026 and immigration status is a characteristic that the government has a legitimate interest in expecting the applicant to change. See, Aiken, Grey, c.4.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>What is the threshold for triggering section 7 in relation to a provision of the IRPA or the Citizenship Act?</p> <ul> <li> You need to demonstrate that the provision negatively impacted the person\u2019s life, liberty, or security.</li> <li> You need to demonstrate that the provision is connected to the negative impact.</li> <li> You need to demonstrate that the breach is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.</li> <li> All of the above</li> </ul> <p>The onus is on the person claiming s.7 breach. This is established through two steps:</p> <ul> <li>(1) show there has been a negative impact, and that the negative impact actually flows from the impugned legislation.</li> <li>(2) Demonstrate that it is not justified under s.1. See Vigo v Canada at para 49-50:</li> </ul> <p>\u201c[49] With a section 7 of the Charter\u202fclaim such as this, the appellant first has to show that the\u202fimpugned legislation negatively impacts or limits her life, liberty or security of the person, thus engaging section 7 of the Charter.</p> <p>[50]\u202fThe appellant must show that the impugned law is sufficiently connected to the prejudice suffered\u202fbefore\u202fsection 7 of the Charter\u202fis engaged, and even if section 7\u202fis found to be engaged, the appellant must then show that the deprivation of her section 7 Charter rights is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.\u201d</p> </li> <li> <p>Your client, who is currently applying for refugee status in Canada, experiences ongoing racial harassment by a neighbour and wants to pursue legal action. Is there a Charter remedy?</p> <ul> <li> No \u2013 the Charter does not apply to the neighbour\u2019s actions.</li> <li> Yes \u2013 the Charter provides a remedy for discrimination.</li> <li> No \u2013 prospects for a Charter remedy are slim because it is a he said she said case.</li> <li> Maybe \u2013 the client should retain a lawyer to assist with a Charter application \u2013 the courts will assess whether your client is protected by the Charter. The Charter applies to governments, government ministries/departments, agencies, boards, commissions, and some bodies that have public functions and receive public funding. It does not apply to private activities by private persons. See Nastasi, c. 3, p. 62; and Aiken, Grey, c.4.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>True or false: In immigration proceedings, the Charter has a broader reach than administrative law because all government bodies are subject to the Charter.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False Administrative law principles apply more broadly, whereas the Charter only applies to public actors and decisions in specific circumstances. Many immigration and citizenship decisions, for example, are not subject to the Charter, but are subject to administrative law principles.

Non-citizens fall into an analogous category to those specifically enumerated in s.15. See, Aiken, Grey, c. 4.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Your client, a Canadian permanent resident, calls you in a panic. Their spouse, a member of a persecuted minority group from their country of origin with no legal status in Canada, has received a removal order and a specific date to report for removal to their country of origin. Your client is worried that their spouse will be targeted and harmed by the authorities if returned to their country of origin. Are Charter rights engaged?</p> <ul> <li> Yes \u2013 because deportation always engages section 7 rights</li> <li> No \u2013because deportation never engages section 7 rights</li> <li> No - because family unity is not protected under section 7</li> <li> Maybe - section 7 may be engaged in the context of removal proceedings (and efforts to defer or quash removal orders) where a risk of harm on return is established Where a risk of harm is alleged in the last stage of removal proceedings, s.7 may be engaged. This is a fact-specific analysis, and will require marshalling evidence to establish that your client\u2019s spouse faces a serious risk of harm in their country of origin. Recent case law suggests that Charter arguments related to return cannot be raised before the IRB in most circumstances as those proceedings do not constitute the end point prior to removal See, Aiken, Grey, c. 4.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Your client, a Canadian permanent resident, calls you in a panic. Their spouse, a citizen of the Netherlands, who has been living without legal status in Canada for some time, just received a removal order. Your client asks you to help them defer or quash the removal order with the benefit of Charter arguments under s.7 on the grounds that the decision infringes their liberty to enjoy family unity.  Is this possible?</p> <ul> <li> Yes \u2013 because deportation always engages section 7 rights.</li> <li> No \u2013 deportation of a non-citizen never engages section 7 rights.</li> <li> No - because courts do not recognize family unity as protected within the ambit section 7</li> <li> Yes - because it restricts the freedom to have family unity under section 7. See Begum v Canada at para 100: \"Courts have consistently declined to recognize a right to family unity or family reunification under section 7. In \u202fMedovarski, for example, the appellant had argued that deportation would remove \u202f\"her liberty to make fundamental decisions that affect her personal life, including her choice to remain with her partner\", and that her security would be infringed\u202f \"by the state-imposed psychological stress of being deported\" \u202f(at para. 45). The Supreme Court rejected that claim, stating that\u202f\"the deportation of a non-citizen in itself cannot implicate the liberty and security interests protected by s. 7 of the [Charter]\"\u202f (at para. 46).\" Section 7 may be engaged in removal proceedings where an individual faces risk of serious harm in the country to which they are being removed.

Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) [excerpted in Aiken, Grey, chapter 4] the Supreme Court concluded that \u201cinternational law rejects deportation to torture, even where national security interests are at stake\u201d, but went on to suggest that in Canada \u201cexceptional circumstances\u201d could justify deportation to torture. The disjuncture between the UN Convention Against Torture\u2019s (CAT) categorical rejection of state action leading to torture on the one hand, and the Canadian government\u2019s view as expressed in the Suresh case, on the other, is explained by:</p> <ul> <li> the fact that the CAT has not been implemented in Canadian immigration law - the actions of the Canadian government are not directly constrained by the CAT</li> <li> the prohibition on return to torture in the CAT is not a jus cogens norm</li> <li> the authenticity of the evidence proffered in Suresh\u2019s case</li> <li> the risk faced by Suresh failed to go beyond mere theory or suspicion See, Suresh v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 SCC 1, at paras. 58-78 in Aiken, Grey, Chapter 4.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Match the following terms, cases and acts to their corresponding descriptions.</p> <ul> <li>jus cogens: international norms that bind all states, regardless of their consent to be bound</li> <li>dualism: Canada\u2019s approach to international treaties: not part of Canadian law until implemented into domestic statutes</li> <li>Baker v Canada: introduced the principle that \u2018values and principles\u2019 of unimplemented international human rights instruments can inform statutory interpretation and discretionary decision making</li> <li>de Guzman v Canada: found that Parliament intended for international human rights instruments to be persuasive and contextual factors in the interpretation and application of the IRPA, but not determinative</li> <li>Convention on the Rights of the Child: strongly supported by Canada, ratified but not fully implemented in domestic law</li> <li>Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families: imposes obligations on both migrant-sending and receiving states and has not been ratified by any major Western country, including Canada</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>According to the short film \u201cUniversal Declaration of Human Rights,\u201d the Universal Declaration of Human Rights can be described as:</p> <ul> <li> A response to World War II, which was designed to prevent future atrocities</li> <li> A set of provisions that lays out the rights of all people irrespective of race, class, gender, ethnicity, citizenship, etc.</li> <li> A source of guidance and inspiration for international, national, and regional human rights work of various types</li> <li> All of the above The short film \u201cUniversal Declaration of Human Rights\u201d contextualizes the Universal Declaration of Human Rights as a response to the atrocities of World War II (Answer A). It emphasizes that the provisions apply to all people equally (Answer B). Similar to Frans Viljoen\u2019s \u201cInternational Human Rights Law: A Short History,\u201d the film also stresses that human rights work takes place at many different interrelated levels (i.e., international, national, and regional) (Answer C).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The ruling in Pillai v Canada (2011) is an example of:</p> <ul> <li> how Canadian law overrides international law (specifically article 7 of the Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights).</li> <li> how international law (specifically article 7 of the Protocol to the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights) overrides Canadian law</li> <li> how the rulings of international bodies have in a rare cases had a direct impact on individuals in Canada</li> <li> how the ruling of international bodies have often had a direct impact on individuals in Canada According to Aiken, Grey, \u201cInternational Human Rights Standards &amp; Immigration Law \u2013 Part 2,\u201d Pillai v Canada was not an example of which set of laws took precedence (which rules out A and B). Pillai v Canada was a rare example of a ruling of an international body having a direct impact on individuals in Canada. In this case, the Pillai family was allowed to remain in Canada. In most cases, the rulings of international bodies do not translate into a direct impact for individuals in Canada.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>In the short film \u201cUniversality of Human Rights,\u201d Abdullahi An-Naim explores the following tension:</p> <ul> <li> Universal human rights as the right to be the same and the right to be different</li> <li> Universal human rights as the right to the same in the face of radical inequities</li> <li> Universal human rights as the right to be different in the face of Western imperialism</li> <li> All of the above Adbullahi An-Naim espouses a form of \u201crooted cosmopolitanism\u201d which attempts to overcome the tension between universal rights (the right to be the same) and regional difference (the right to be different), which makes Answer A the best answer. Answer B may sound familiar as we\u2019ve come across the tension between the theory and practice of human rights in other texts (e.g., \u201cThe Story of Human Rights\u201d). Answer C also represents a common criticism of human rights (i.e., that human rights are a product of Western thought and thus another form of Western imperialism), but that is not An-Naim\u2019s position.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>According to the \u201cCommittee Against Torture, Concluding observations on the seventh periodic report of Canada\u201d (2018), which of the following committee recommendations from the previous reporting cycle have been fully implemented:</p> <ul> <li> Recommendations about the treatment of individuals who are detained as part of the \u201csecurity certificates\u201d system</li> <li> Recommendations about the medical and mental health care services available for non-citizens who are in detention facilities and who have been detained because of an \u201cirregular arrival\u201d</li> <li> Recommendations that the State take measures to ensure that confessions obtained under torture or ill treatment are ruled inadmissible</li> <li> None of the above Answers A, B, and C correspond to the recommendations not implemented under paragraphs 12, 13, and 17, respectively. See point 9 under the heading \u201cPrincipal subjects of concern and recommendations\u201d, which outlines which recommendations from the last report were not implemented.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>According to the short film \u201cThe Story of Human Rights,\u201d the history of human rights begins in:</p> <ul> <li> Ancient Greece with Alexander the Great</li> <li> Ancient Babylon with Cyrus the Great</li> <li> Ancient China with Qin Shi Huang</li> <li> Pre-revolutionary France with Jean-Jacques Rousseau Frans Viljoen begins the history of human rights with the Magna Carta in England and the American Declaration of Independence in 1776, but the short film \u201cThe Story of Human Rights\u201d reaches farther back in history and points to ancient Babylon / Persia and the Cyrus Cylinder as the first important milestone on the path to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The authors of \u201cBots at the Gate: A Human Rights Analysis of Automated Decision-Making in Canada\u2019s Immigration and Refugee System\u201d (2018) highlight which of the following as cause for concern:</p> <ul> <li> Immigration and refugee law is a high-stakes context, in which people\u2019s lives hang in the balance.</li> <li> Canada\u2019s immigration and refugee system is already the source of human rights concerns, and automating it will be tantamount to endorsing the status quo of a flawed system.</li> <li> Migrants have limited access to human rights protections and resources with which to defend those rights.</li> <li> All of the above</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>According to James Hathaway, the critical shortcomings of the 2018 Global Compact on Refugees include:</p> <ul> <li> a failure to remedy the operational deficiencies of the Refugee Convention</li> <li> a failure to include adequate consultative mechanism for stakeholder groups</li> <li> that every large movement of refugees will require a new agreement</li> <li> A and C</li> <li> B and C Hathaway describes the Refugee Compact process as \u201cthin\u201d and implies that it was an error not to aim for a binding protocol to remedy the operational deficiencies of the Refugee Convention. He also notes that its application to undefined \u201clarge\u201d movements will yield a \u201cnever-ending series of discussions\u201d. The one clear output of the Compact is that there will be \u201clots and lots of meetings\u201d, ruling out B.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>True or false: The authors of \u201cBots at the Gate: A Human Rights Analysis of Automated Decision-Making in Canada\u2019s Immigration and Refugee System\u201d (2018) are fundamentally opposed to the use of automated decision-making in Canada\u2019s immigration and refugee system.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False The authors of \u201cBots at the Gate\u201d are concerned about the potential for human rights abuses, but they are not fundamentally opposed to the idea of automated decision-making. Implemented appropriately, automated decision making could reduce discrimination and nepotism and make the system \u201cmore transparent, equitable, and just.\u201d</li> </ul> </li> <li> <ol> <li>According to Frans Viljoen\u2019s \u201cInternational Human Rights Law: A Short History,\u201d the history of human rights is best described as:</li> <li> A global history under the guidance of the United Nation\u2019s Charter</li> <li> A regional history under three large umbrellas: the Council of Europe, the Organization of the American States (OAS) and the Organization for African Unity (OAU)</li> <li> A sub-regional history in which sub-Regional Economic Communities (RECs) play the most important roles in protecting human rights</li> <li> A complex history that links global, regional, sub-regional and nongovernmental organizations in common cause Viljoen organizes his text in such a way as to emphasize that human rights work is done at many different, interrelated levels (global, regional, sub-regional and nongovernmental). He dispels the popular notion that human rights are the sole purview of the United Nations.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>In \u201cCommittee Against Torture, Concluding observations on the seventh periodic report of Canada\u201d (2018), the Committee recommends that the State \u201cconsider undertaking an assessment of the impact of the Safe Third Country Agreement on potential asylum seekers arriving from\u201d:</p> <ul> <li> Afghanistan</li> <li> South Africa</li> <li> the United States of America</li> <li> all of the above Although Canada considers the United States a safe country for asylum claimants to seek and obtain protection when they meet the definition of a refugee, the Committee is concerned about an increase \u201cin the number of individuals in the United States wishing to seek asylum in Canada in an attempt to flee aggressive anti-immigration policies\u201d and asks Canada to reassess whether the US is indeed a safe country for asylum claimants.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>How can international law be used as an advocacy tool in Canadian migration law?</p> <ul> <li> the individual complaints procedure and the group complaints procedure</li> <li> the individual complaints procedure and media pressure on government</li> <li> the individual complaints procedure and the requirement for period reporting</li> <li> the individual complaints procedure and appeals to the United Nations system In \u201cInternational Human Rights Standards &amp; Immigration Law \u2013 Part 2\u201d, Aiken, Grey et al make no distinction between individual complaints and group complaints, which rules out Answer A. Answer B is partially true insofar as the UN reporting process subjects countries like Canada to public/media scrutiny, but the UN reports themselves (not the media coverage of them) represent the advocacy tool, which makes C the best answer. Answer D refers to the same thing using two different terms: the \u201cindividual complaints procedure\u201d and \u201cappeals to the UN system\u201d are one and the same.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>In Suresh v Canada (2016), Canada argued:</p> <ul> <li> that extended periods of detention during deportation do not violate the American Declaration.</li> <li> detention during deportation proceedings does not violate the right to equality under the American Declaration.</li> <li> that Mr. Suresh\u2019s complaints under the American Declaration were moot.</li> <li> all of the above. See, Suresh v. Canada (2016), paras. 20-29.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>In \u201cTechnological Testing Grounds\u201d (2020), how do technological advances threaten the human rights of migrants:</p> <ul> <li> The automated drones that patrol national borders force migrants to take more dangerous migration routes, which results in an increased number of deaths.</li> <li> Algorithms used to assess people\u2019s \u201ccredibility\u201d integrate the same discriminatory standards as human decision-makers.</li> <li> Partnerships between governments and private companies endanger the privacy of people whose information is collected (e.g., at borders).</li> <li> All of the above</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>According to the short film \u201cThe Story of Human Rights,\u201d this history of human rights is best described as:</p> <ul> <li> A slow but straight-forward trajectory toward the liberation of humankind from absolutist rule</li> <li> A slow, spiral-like development in which progress is followed by regression</li> <li> A ambivalent development that exposes the weaknesses of liberal democracy at the same time that it protects minority rights</li> <li> A fast-paced and straight-forward trajectory toward a cosmopolitan future in which all people enjoy equal rights \u201cThe Story of Human Rights\u201d portrays the development of human rights as slow but not straight forward, which rules out A and D. Answer C may sound familiar as Frans Vilijoen hints at the origin of human rights in the weaknesses of liberal democracy and \u201cmajority rule.\u201d Answer B is the best summary of the short film \u201cThe Story of Human Rights\u201d as it captures both the speed of the development as well as the back and forth between progress (e.g., the Magna Carta) and regression (e.g., the Holocaust) in the history of human rights.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Which of the following best describes Canada\u2019s approach to international law:</p> <ul> <li> Canada ratifies all international conventions, which provide a source of values and principles that inform the interpretation of Canadian law.</li> <li> Canada ratifies all international conventions, which then give rise to domestically enforceable obligations.</li> <li> Canada ratifies most international conventions, which then give rise to domestically enforceable obligations.</li> <li> Canada ratifies most international conventions, but few have been systematically incorporated into Canadian law. According to Aiken, Grey, Canada has not ratified the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families, which rules out Answers A and B. Furthermore, Canada ratifies most international conventions but does not systematically integrate them into Canadian law, which renders them unenforceable in court and rules out Answer C.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>What is the Magna Carta and why is it still important today?</p> <ul> <li> The Magna Carta is a thirteenth-century historical document that established the separation of church and state in England and thus served an important precursor for the creation of liberal democracy and the international human rights framework.</li> <li> The Magna Carta is a thirteenth-century historical document that established the rule of law in England and is considered a precursor to today\u2019s international human rights framework.</li> <li> The Magna Carta is a thirteenth-century historical document that established England as a constitutional democratic monarchy, thus limiting the power of the king.</li> <li> The Magna Carta is a thirteenth-century historical map (Latin \u201cCarta\u201d) that outlined the geographical boundaries of the English nation. The Magna Carta did not establish the separation of church and state. In fact, the pope overturned the Magna Carta, declaring it \u201cnull and void of all validity forever\u201d (which rules out Answer A). The Magna Carta also did not establish England as a constitutional democratic monarchy, though it was a stepping stone in that direction (which rules out Answer C). \u201cCarta\u201d means \u201ccharter\u201d in Latin, not \u201cmap\u201d (which rules out Answer D).</li> </ul> </li> </ol>","tags":["ICL810","Notes","Quizzes"]},{"location":"immigration/810/weekTwonotes/","title":"Week 2: Notes and Quizzes","text":"","tags":["ICL810","Notes","Quizzes"]},{"location":"immigration/810/weekTwonotes/#notes","title":"Notes","text":"2.1.1 The Parts of a Decided Case <ul> <li>Style of Cause:<ul> <li>The style of cause shows the names of the parties to the legal dispute - e.g. R v Desautel or Kanthasamy v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration).</li> <li>In a civil case the plaintiff or \"initiator\" is named first; in criminal cases the \"R\" representing Rex or Regina for King or Queen (i.e. the Crown) comes first.</li> <li>The style of cause is always italicized when you are citing or referring to the case.</li> <li>Do not include a period after the \"v\"</li> </ul> </li> <li>Preliminary information:<ul> <li>a collective term that refers to everything found between the style of cause and the beginning of the decision (judgment).</li> <li>It includes the court name, the judge(s) who heard the case, the date the decision was published, citations for the case (derived from where the case was published) and the names of the lawyers who argued the case on behalf of each party.</li> <li>The term \"preliminary information\" can also extend to other elements identified by their own names, like the catchwords, or headnote, depending on whether these are included with the case.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Catch words or Catchlines:<ul> <li>Catchlines are key phrases and key words separated by dashes that describe the legal issues decided in the case, as well as provide a very brief description of the facts of the case reported.</li> <li>In many cases, both catchlines and headnotes, below, are written by legal editors - not by the court itself.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Headnote:<ul> <li>This is a summary of the facts, issues, and reasons for the decision rendered.</li> <li>The headnote is not part of the court's official decision.

You might compare this to the Disposition, which is simply the procedural outcome (appeal allowed, etc) and which usually appears in the headnote;</li> <li> the legal Issue(s) - in other words, the legal question(s) that the court answers in its decision;</li> <li> the legal Rule(s) (in other words, the law) that the court relied on in its judgement, which could be derived from legislation, case law, and/or government policy;</li> <li> the court's Reasoning, in other words, the paragraphs in which the court applies the law to the legally relevant facts of the case in order to answer the question(s) posed in the issue.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> 2.1.2 Key Concepts in Legislation <ul> <li>The word legislation is an umbrella term. It refers to both statutes and regulations.</li> <li>In order to receive Royal Assent and become law, a bill\u202fmust pass through a number of stages, such as readings, debate, committee hearings and reports, and voting. \u202fIt must be approved in both chambers of Parliament: the Senate and the House of Commons.</li> <li> <p>An act may come into force in a number of ways:</p> <ul> <li>Upon receiving Royal Assent, the approval by the constitutional monarch, or by their representative in Canada (the Governor General)</li> <li>On a fixed date, either in the future (prospective) or in the past (retrospective- common with fiscal and tax legislation)</li> <li>Upon Proclamation of the Governor in Council (the Governor General)</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Once a federal statute has received Royal Assent, it is published in three places: in the Canada Gazette; in a printed annual volume called Statutes of Canada; and on the government's legislation website, which is called Justice Laws</p> </li> <li>Revision or consolidation of statutes is the process by which various amendments made over time are \u201cedited in\u201d or incorporated into the version of the act that you see on the government database. The current consolidated version of an act on Justice Laws reflects all changes made to that act between the date of its enactment up to the date of the most recent consolidation (the \"currency date\").</li> <li>FILAC stands for: Facts, Issues, Law (or sometimes called Rule), Application (or sometimes called Analysis), and Conclusion. The first three steps are often described as iterative; these three elements are interwoven and interdependent.</li> <li>The A step in FILAC may take several forms:<ul> <li>Reasoning by analogy: drawing an analogy between the two cases, comparing like to like.</li> <li>Rules based reasoning: applying the legislation to your client's facts. You may also rely on rules extracted and synthesized from case law.</li> <li>Policy-based reasoning: there may be serious policy issues that are raised by your client's file. This is especially true in an area of law like immigration and citizenship law, in which case you might argue that public policy objectives should be taken into account in any determination of your client's case.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> 2.3 Legal Research <ul> <li>Legal information is divided into two types: primary sources, which \"give\" the law; and secondary sources, which provide commentary on the law and point you to relevant primary sources.</li> <li>There are two Canadian legal encyclopedias, and they are only accessible through the subscription services. On Westlaw, the encyclopedia is called the Canadian Encyclopedic Digest (the CED). On Lexis, the encyclopedia is called Halsbury's laws of Canada (Halsbury's). CanLII does not currently have a legal encyclopedia.</li> <li>Many\u202folder federal and provincial\u202fstatutes\u202fcan\u202fnow\u202fbe accessed for\u202ffree\u202fon the\u202fsearchable Internet Archive. You may wish to make a note of this in your text. \u202f</li> <li>Both subscription\u202fservices now carry\u202ftribunal\u202fdecisions, including decisions\u202fof the various sub-bodies of the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada \u2013 as does\u202fCanLII. As you may know, you can also find some of these decisions on the IRB\u2019s own website.</li> <li>\u201ccase summaries and digests\u201d\u202fare not, in fact, secondary sources \u2013 they are more\u202foften characterized as\u202f\"finding tools\".\u202fAn important point to remember:\u202fcase digest databases exist both\u202fin Westlaw and Lexis, but not in\u202fCanLII.</li> <li>Noting up Statutes: Finding case law that has interpreted the various provisions ofa statute is also a key component of statute law research, and is referred to as noting-up. Judicial consideration of the statute can be found using the noting-up features in databases such as WestlawNext Canada, LexisNexis Quicklaw, and CanLII.<ul> <li>There are two parts. In the first part of a note up for legislation, you check for currency - ensuring your target legislation is in force, not repealed, and that you are looking at the most up-to-date version. In the second part you check for judicial consideration: how courts and tribunals have interpreted and applied that legislation in decided cases.</li> <li>Noting Up Step 1: Currency<ul> <li>check Justice Laws website</li> <li>check that no amending provisions have been enacted and come into force during the currency gap using LEGISinfo</li> </ul> </li> <li>Noting up Step 2: Judicial treatment<ul> <li>To help you do so, you will use a citator</li> <li>In CanLII, you can navigate to your target section and click on the speech bubble. Then click on \"Citing documents\"</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Noting-up Cases: Noting-up involves finding the history of a case and the subsequent cases that have considered the case you are noting-up.<ul> <li>court decisions are not binding on administrative tribunals at all. This may be true in some situations, but less so in the case of immigration law.</li> <li>the Supreme Court noted in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Vavilov, 2019 SCC 65 at para 111 (emphasis added): \"It is evident that both statutory and common law will impose constraints on how and what an administrative decision maker can lawfully decide.\"</li> <li>the IRB itself has said \u201cThe IRB must follow decisions of the Federal Court and the Supreme Court of Canada\u201d .</li> <li>first step of the note up, we consider the effect of the passage of time on our target case. We look at the history of that decision.</li> <li>In the second step, we investigate the subsequent judicial treatment or judicial consideration of our target case. In other words, we want to know how other courts have subsequently treated our target decision.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The legal research checklist suggested in the McCormack text consists of 10 high-level steps:<ul> <li>Identify the legally relevant facts and articulate the legal issues.</li> <li>Identify relevant keywords.</li> <li>Draw up a research plan using a checklist.</li> <li>Find secondary sources.</li> <li>Find relevant legislation (including Constitutional provisions).</li> <li>Find relevant case law.</li> <li>Read carefully.</li> <li>Consider relevant foreign or international law (like treaties).</li> <li>Update (note up) the law.</li> <li>Think, synthesize, write and proofread.</li> </ul> </li> <li>An example of a click-path for a fictitious case law search using CanLII:   12 November 2022: CanLII &gt; Primary Law &gt; Federal &gt; Courts &gt; Supreme Court of Canada DB&gt;  [keyword+Boolean:] spous /3 sponsor AND genuin* &gt; [filter by decision date:] decision date = after 2010</li> <li>Chaining: also referred to as cited reference searching. Cases are constantly cited by other cases, usually those that are deciding the same legal issue, and those citing cases can be easily located using a tool called a citator.</li> <li>cited references: In your target case (search result), the court or legal decision maker cited other, earlier, decisions that were relevant to the legal issue being decided. These are called cited references and will appear in the text of your target case.</li> <li>citing references: Once your target case was published on CanLII and in other places, it was in turn cited by other legal decision makers, deciding other cases on the same or similar legal issues. These are called citing references.</li> <li>Keywords: serve several functions in legal research. Not only are they the basis for keyword searching, but the process of extracting keywords forces you to think carefully about your research problem as you frame it as a legal issue or issues within the larger body of immigration and citizenship law.</li> <li>Keywords Hierarchy:<ul> <li>Primary level keywords (abbreviated as 1y): are words that refer to the top-level areas of law - like immigration law, or citizenship law, or administrative law.</li> <li>Secondary keywords (2y) are words that refer to legal issues and sub-issues within that top-level area of law - like family class immigration or spousal sponsorship, or permanent residency, all under immigration law.</li> <li>Finally, tertiary (3y) keywords refer more or less to your client's fact pattern: second marriage, sole caregiver, poor health, cohabitation, shared finances, child, etc.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Boiler Plate Provisions: clauses that are used from contract to contract.</li> <li>CanLII commentary: While CanLII does not currently have an encyclopedia, it does index commentary on cases and legislation, which can be useful.</li> <li>Non-traditional secondary sources serve the same two essential functions as any secondary source: they orient you to an unfamiliar area of law and they can point you to relevant primary sources (legislation and case law).</li> <li>CanLII Connects is a free, searchable resource, and the content is created by legal professionals commenting on the law as it develops in their practice area.</li> </ul> 2.3.1 The Vocabulary of Legal Research: A Short Glossary <ul> <li>Access point: The online point from which you begin research in an electronic environment, usually a specific web URL. Access points include, but are not limited to, a service, a web page, or a search engine.</li> <li>Citator tool: A citator tool is used to identify cases and secondary sources that have cited your target resource, whether that is case law or legislation. These citing references are important, because they help you to assess the quality (that is, the strength, relevance or authoritativeness) of your target resource. A citator tool is essential for noting up (or updating) case law and legislation. On CanLII, the citator tool is called RefLex. It is accessed through the \u201cNoteup/Discussion\u201d box on the landing page. Westlaw and Lexis also have citator tools, called KeyCite and QuickCite respectively.</li> <li>Click-path notation: A way of recording for yourself or for someone else the series of steps or \"clicks\" you perform when searching for legal information in an electronic environment. A click path should identify essential elements of your searching such as: the date your searched; the access point (where you started from); any sub-databases or tools that you then navigated to; and any specific search techniques you used (like filtering) or search strings with connectors that you used.\u202f\u202f</li> <li>Database: A collection of digital information stored electronically and organized in such a way that information can be searched on various dimensions. CanLII, as well as Westlaw and Lexis each contain dozens of legal information databases.</li> <li>Digest: A digest is a short summary of a single decided issue in a case. Note that it is not a summary of a case as a whole. Since some cases result in a number of decided legal issues, one such case may give rise to more than one digest. Digests are written by legal editors employed by the subscription services Westlaw and Lexis, where they are collected into searchable databases (see below). CanLII doesn't have digests and nor does it have a digest database.</li> <li>Digest database: A collection of digests organized by legal topic, found in either of the subscription databases (Westlaw or Lexis) but not in CanLII. Each digest is assigned a classification in the topical scheme. All digests related to a single legal issue are stored together. Once you find the classification for your legal issue, you can find all digests related to that issue.  The Canadian Abridgment Digests are found on Westlaw. The Canada Digest is found on Lexis.</li> <li>Disintermediation: In legal research, disintermediation is a recent phenomenon whereby large amounts of information are available directly from an author to a legal consumer of information. There is no \"middle-man\" - in other words, this is information supplied without any guidance in locating or interpreting that information, or editorial vetting of the resource, as might be provided by a legal information management expert (law librarian) or an editorial team including peer reviewers.</li> <li>Legal Encyclopedia: A legal encyclopedia is a specialized authoritative traditional secondary source. A legal encyclopedia article on your topic will orient you to the law and also point you to the relevant primary sources (legislation and case law) relevant to that topic. Content is organized by topic and the table of contents can be browsed or keyword searched.  New content is added regularly. There are two legal encyclopedias in Canada. Both are accessed online through the subscription services. The Canadian Encyclopedic Digest (CED) is found on Westlaw; Halsbury\u2019s Laws of Canada is found on Lexis. CanLII does not have a legal encyclopedia.</li> <li>Research checklist: A research checklist provides a framework to support the process of legal research. It is designed to ensure that your research is systematic and organized and that you don't miss any resources. You can also use a checklist to record your searches, so as to be able to refer to them in the future. This helps you to avoid replicating searches you have already done. It is also a convenient means of communicating to someone else the searches you performed.</li> <li>Research strategy: The combination of tools and techniques which together form a systematic approach for locating and retrieving legal information for problem-solving.</li> <li>Resource: (Sometimes just called a \u201csource\u201d.) Legal information of a particular type, presented in a specific format, identifiable by a citation. In legal research, sources are classified as either primary (legislation and case law) or secondary (legal commentary whether in traditional or non traditional formats).</li> <li>Search engine: A software application powered by an algorithm enabling users to search for information held in larger repositories, like on the World Wide Web. The term is sometimes conflated with the idea of a web browser, which is also a software application but which is stored locally on a user\u2019s computer. For example, Alphabet Inc.\u2019s proprietary browser is called Chrome; its search engine is called Google. A search engine selects and returns results based not only on the search terms entered by the user, but also based on other selection criteria built into the algorithm, which are usually not known to the user.</li> <li>Service: A collection of research tools and databases available from a single access point. In legal research, a service provides a wide range of primary and secondary legal information and may also offer additional value-added elements, like annotations, classification schemes or commentary, as well as useful tools or integrated functionality to facilitate searching. CanLII is a free service. Westlaw and Lexis are also services and are both subscription-based (fee-based).</li> <li>Technique: Any observable information-seeking behaviour. In an electronic research environment, a search technique involves the use of a computer. Techniques can be used alone or in combination, and tailored for the specific information seeking goals of the researcher. Keyword searching is an example of a search technique.</li> <li>Tool: A broad term referring to anything you use in support of information-seeking for legal problem solving. An example of a research tool is a citator.</li> </ul> 2.3.2 Reference Documents <ul> <li>Charterpedia</li> <li>IRCC \u2013 List of Acts, online</li> <li>IRCC \u2013 List of Regulations</li> <li>IRCC\u202fFederal/Provincial\u202fAgreements (sec 8 IRPA)</li> <li>IRCC Operational Instructions and Guidelines</li> <li>IRCC Ministerial Instructions</li> <li>IRCC Operational Bulletins and Manuals</li> <li>IRCC Annual Reports to Parliament on Immigration (scroll down)</li> <li>IRB Rules and\u202fIRB\u202fLegal\u202fand Policy Resources Index Page</li> </ul> 2.4 Legal Writing <ul> <li>Most legal writing can be classified as one of three types:<ul> <li>descriptive: Descriptive writing is as it sounds: it describes the law and its impact, or describes a legal reasoning process. A case brief is an example of descriptive legal writing.</li> <li>predictive: ou apply law to facts and issues to analyze how you think a legal decision maker will determine an issue in a case. An example of this is when you give a client an opinion in writing on the strength of their case.</li> <li>persuasive: sometimes called legal argument, provides a decision maker with  information - the facts of the matter, an articulation of the legal issue, and a summary of the relevant law as applied to the facts - that compels them to render a fair and favourable decision on your client's case.

But keyword searching is a difficult technique to perfect. If you are not expert at the use of Boolean connectors, your results list may contain too many results to review easily, many of which are irrelevant to your needs. It is always best to begin your research by using a reliable secondary source, which will point you to relevant cases.

CanLII Connects offers interesting commentary, but this is more like a non-traditional secondary source than an encyclopedia.  CanLII, however, is always improving and making strides in developing the tools it offers.

Because of their two-fold function, secondary sources should always be your first approach when you are dealing with an area of law that you know little about. Secondary Sources give you an overview of the law, and they point you to significant primary sources. This is also true if you do know something about the law, but need to be reminded or reoriented as to the central concepts, leading cases, and relevant legislation that are essential to legal problem solving in a specific topic area.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Which of the following is a 2y keyword under the 1y classification \"Immigration and Citizenship Law\"?</p> <ul> <li> Extended family</li> <li> Family class immigration</li> <li> \"friends and family\"</li> <li> Family law</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Which of the following constitutes the highest case law authority for any given proposition in law?</p> <ul> <li> An IRB decision</li> <li> A Federal Court of Appeal decision.</li> <li> A tribunal decision.</li> <li> An immigration officer's decision.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Which of the following statements is true?</p> <ol> <li>Keyword+Boolean searching is the most important search technique in legal research.</li> <li>In generating keywords for searching, you may need to generate a number of synonyms as well.</li> <li> Statement 1 is true.</li> <li> Both statements are true.</li> <li> Statement 2 is true.</li> <li> Neither statement is true. --- The first statement is false. While keyword + Boolean searching is an important technique, there are other techniques that may be more efficient, depending on what you are researching. Keyword + Boolean searching can be difficult to master, and can yield unexpected \u2013 and unexpectedly voluminous \u2013 results. Its value depends greatly on your mastery of the technique. It's important to leverage other options, like using secondary sources which can point you to primary sources, or using a leading case to finding other cases on point, or noting up a legislative provision to find cases that interpret that provision. The second statement is true. One of the reasons a keyword+Boolean technique can be difficult to master is that you are asking the search algorithm to simply return matches of a keyword. If the concept you are researching \u2013 like drunk driving, for example \u2013 can be expressed in different ways (\"DWI\", \"DUI\", \"driving under the influence\", \"driving while intoxicated\", etc.), then you will need to use all of these search terms in your search, since you can't predict which terms a court will use in referring to that concept.</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>You are trying to find relevant cases on a narrow legal issue, and you have no leads. You understand the area of law and the relevant legislative provision well, since these were covered in depth in one of your courses. You can accurately articulate the legal issue. You would like to search in CanLII. How should you begin your search?</p> <ul> <li> Begin with a keyword+Boolean search over full text.</li> <li> Begin with a digest database.</li> <li> Begin with a subject-based search.</li> <li> Begin by noting up the legislation. All of the techniques here could be used, but an efficient approach is to note up the legislation and look for cases interpreting the legislation. Recall that CanLII does not have a digest database. Similarly, while it is starting to organize cases by legal topic, the topic areas are broad not detailed. Finally, a keyword search over full text can lead to too many results, more than you can possibly review. there are factors that help you eliminate options.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>When looking for relevant authorities in support of your submissions on behalf of a client, look for:</p> <ul> <li> Cases from a high level of court that have not been reversed on appeal, and statutes with pending amendments.</li> <li> Cases from any level of court so long as the facts are the same, and relevant regulations with pending amendments.</li> <li> Decisions of the first instance from the IRB/IAD, legislation that is current, and any pending regulations.</li> <li> The most current official version of relevant legislation, and decisions with similar facts and issues to those of your client, preferably from the federal court or higher. In order for your submissions to be persuasive, they must be based on law that is current and authoritative. Ensure that you are using the most up-to-date version of any legislation (that is, legislation that has all recent amendments and repeals edited into the version you are looking at), whether statutes or regulations, and case law that triggers the principle of stare decisis and is binding precedent, insofar as possible, on the decision maker to whom you are making submissions. Be sure that you have also consulted relevant government policy, a rich source of information as to how the government believes the law should be applied.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Consider the following keyword + Boolean search string for case law: \"best interests\" and (child /p (grand OR mother)). What can you predict about the results of this search?</p> <ul> <li> All cases in your results list will contain the word \"children\" within the same paragraph as the word \"grandmother\".</li> <li> All cases in your results list will be primarily about immigration law.</li> <li> All cases in your results list will contain the term \"child\" within 5 words of the phrase \"best interests\".</li> <li> All cases in your results list will contain the phrase \"best interests\"</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The chaining technique requires:</p> <ul> <li> a Table of Authorities and Social Science Research Network (SSRN) or Google Scholar.</li> <li> a citator tool and the citation block at the top of the full-text view.</li> <li> a citator tool and a digest database.</li> <li> a Table of Authorities and a citator tool. Chaining is a technique you can use to take one good case and parlay it into more good cases. You begin with a good target case, one that is relevant to your analysis. Review the decision for cases that your target case has cited (look for a Table of Authorities or \"Cases Cited\"); and cases that have cited your target case (citator tool results). This is essentially the \"citator approach\" in the One Good Case technique. A digest database, while good for the other approach in the One Good Case technique, does not depend on the web of citations for generating other cases on point - it uses a digest database classification system to do that. Note that the citation block at the top of the full text view of your target case indicates where you case has been published, not where it has been cited.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>What is stare decisis?</p> <ul> <li> A legal procedure whereby an applicant asks for a decision without a hearing.</li> <li> A principle that says cases having similar facts and that deal with the same legal issues should be decided the same way.</li> <li> A principle that says legal fact similarity is less important than legal issue similarity.</li> <li> An aspect of case law only found in court of appeal cases and higher. Stare decisis is a Latin phrase that refers to the principle underlying the development of the common law. Cases that involve the same legal issue, have similar facts, and are subject to the same legal rules should be decided the same way. It is this principle which gives us the idea of precedent or \"authority\", which is why it's important in legal research. Stare decisis applies to decisions at all levels of court in a common law jurisdiction like Canada, but the degree to which any decision functions as a precedent will depend on the level of court that rendered the decision. It is becoming more common for the immigration tribunals to strive for a consistent body of law, but in general, cases decided by the Federal Court of Appeal or Supreme Court of Canada are considered to have the greatest authority.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>What is filtering?</p> <ul> <li> A technique for narrowly articulating a legal issue.</li> <li> A technique used to narrow the population of search results returned.</li> <li> A technique in persuasive legal writing.</li> <li> A technique for making a case brief more concise. Filtering is a basic search technique whereby you set parameters that your search results must meet (jurisdiction, level of court, date, etc.) in order to narrow a population of search results. You can filter search results on all three services.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>CanLII is the preferred access point for retrieving consolidated legislation.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False Although CanLII does maintain a database of legislation, the most current version of any federal act or regulation will be found on the government web site Justice Laws. Thus, Justice Laws is the preferred access point.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>We extract keywords only for the purpose of creating search strings.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False It is true that keywords, when used together with Boolean connectors, are the building blocks of good search strings. But keywords aren't just for search strings; they serve other purposes in legal research. For example, in the early stages of your research, they help you conceptualize and articulate your client's legal issue as you cycle through the first few steps of the legal research checklist (identify the legally relevant facts; articulate the legal issues; retrieve and read relevant secondary sources). And they alert you to the organization of legal information for your topic, helping you name the specific legal issues in a sub-segment of immigration law so that you can zero in more effectively on relevant primary and secondary sources.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Legal research is hard because it is very difficult to find relevant information on various topics.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False Many believe that finding the law is hard.\u202f In fact, it has never been easier.\u202fThere has never been such a large amount of legal information\u202fso widely\u202favailable and so accessible.\u202f However, the huge and ever-expanding volume of legal information can create its own challenges. It is easy to become overwhelmed by the amount of legal information you find in an online search, and as a result, to become distracted and inefficient. To remain on-task with your searches, remember to think carefully about your problem before you begin. Using the the FILAC framework early on in your research process can help you analyze your client's problem and alert you to the types of legal information that will be relevant, before you set out to look for the applicable law and commentary. Similarly, using a research checklist and tracking your searches can help you avoid duplicating your efforts.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The terms \"source law\" and \"consolidated law\" are not interchangeable.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False These terms refer to two different points in the \"life\" of a piece of legislation:  the law as it appeared when it was first enacted \u2013 source law \u2013 or the same law as it appears after any amendments to the law have been edited in to the text \u2013 consolidated statutes (sometimes also called revised statutes). These terms are not interchangeable. The consolidated version of an act - that is, the version of the act that is most up-to-date - may be quite different in its text from the way the same act looked when it was first enacted. This would be due to amendments made to that act since the time the act was first enacted. This is why it is important to check that you are using the most recent version of the act in your legal analysis.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Westlaw, Lexis and CanLII all have citator tools.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False Each of the services has a citator tool, although the ones in the subscription databases offer more features and information when you are noting up and looking for judicial treatment.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>An Act that amends IRPA\u202f just received Royal Assent. This means that these amendments immediately apply to your client.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False Although an act must receive Royal Assent in order to become law, it must also come into force before it applies to the public. Amendments can come into force upon receiving Royal Assent, but they could also come into force on a date to be proclaimed, on a fixed date (past or future), or in any combination of these options. Depending on your client's situation and timeline, you may still need to consider the amendments, but do not assume that they are in force just because the amending act has received Royal Assent. You must check specifically for coming into force information found in the amending act.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>You are looking for cases that have interpreted and applied a section of an act.

It was pronounced to be in force effective June 10, 2022. The parent act for establishing this regulation is the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants Act, SC 2019, c 29, s 292 [College Act], and specifically the authority given to the Minister in s 43 of that act to establish the initial code of conduct for the new College members, including RCICs and RISIAs.</li> <li>When the Minister published the Code on June 22, 2022, a background document was also published with it, called the Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement (RIAS).</li> <li>The Interpretation Guide is intended to provide clarification and guidance, with reference to current best practices, for Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultants (RCICs) and Regulated International Student Immigration Advisors (RISIAs) (collectively licensees), on the Code of Professional Conduct for Licensees of the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants. The Guide should be read in conjunction with the Code. However, it must be noted that the Guide itself is not a substitute for the Code. All work and submissions made to support an argument in your written assignments must refer to the Code rather than the Interpretation Guide.</li> <li>In 2023, a new summary of professional standards for College licensees, drafted in conjunction with licensees themselves, was adopted by the College Board.</li> <li>Many guidelines such as rules of court or standards of professional conduct are structured as regulations made pursuant to the act under which they are promulgated.</li> <li>It is acceptable in formal written work to shorten this to \u201cthe Code\u201d or just \u201cCode\u201d, or another term of your choosing, as long as you use the full title the first time you use it and put the short form you choose in square brackets after it. Example:<ul> <li>Code of Professional Conduct for College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants Licensees, SOR/2022-128 [Code].</li> </ul> </li> <li>In addition to referring to the Code itself, you will need to refer to specific section numbers in your written assignments. For example, in a written assignment, you wish to refer to the requirement to know when and how to apply for an adjournment at a hearing. To refer to this element of competency (knowing when and how to apply for an adjournment), you would write \u201csection 19(2)(b)(iii)\u201d. The abbreviation would be \u201cs 19(2)(b)(iii)\u201d.</li> <li>In Case Study 2 in this Module, the consultant is representing a husband and wife on a spousal sponsorship file. This is generally referred to as a joint retainer and both clients must sign the Service Agreement. In joint retainers, special rules apply because the consultant has a duty of loyalty to advance the interests of both parties equally and can only do so as long as they are sharing all relevant information and their interests (and instructions to the consultant) are aligned throughout the process.</li> <li>Law Society of Ontario, \"Steps for Dealing with the Paralegal Joint Retainer Rules\" (last visited 7 December 2022): Law Society of Ontario.</li> <li>you should not accept a joint retainer if:<ul> <li>it is likely that a contentious issue between the parties will arise or their interests, rights or obligations will diverge as the matter progresses; or</li> <li>the interests of the parties are not sufficiently similar to allow you to act in the best interests of all of the parties to the joint retainer.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Where the clients have consented to a joint retainer and a contentious issue between them or some of them arises, refrain from advising any of them on the contentious issue unless the clients have previously agreed that you may continue to advise one of them about the contentious matter.</li> <li>Complaints Committee of CICC either determines the penalty or may refer the matter to the Discipline Committee if the evidence shows very serious violations (e.g. involving fraud or exploiting vulnerable clients) for large fines, suspension or revocation of licence.</li> <li>The Discipline Committee is an independent tribunal which conducts hearings in keeping with rules of procedural fairness; the College is represented by counsel and the RCIC may retain counsel if they wish. Decisions of the Discipline Committee are subject to Judicial Review in the Federal Court.</li> <li>During the course, you will do two entries in your Reflective Practice Journal.

However, only one Code is in effect now.  This is the one which we study in the GDipICL Program and refer to as \u201cthe Code\u201d.  It is the:</p> <ul> <li> RCIC Code of Professional Ethics</li> <li> ICCRC Code of Conduct for Immigration Consultants</li> <li> CICC Code of Professional Conduct for Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultants</li> <li> Code of Professional Conduct for College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants Licensees</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Statutory interpretation principles apply when interpreting the Code, as the Code is a federal regulation.  Which of the following explains a key principle of statutory interpretation and gives a correct example:</p> <ul> <li> In the definition of a \"client\" in section 1(1), the word \"or\" separates clauses (b) and (c), meaning that a person who meets any one of the three conditions would be considered a client.</li> <li> Given the definition of a \"client\" in section 1(1), a person who does not fit within any of the three clauses is not considered a client.</li> <li> Section 22(1) of the Code lists a variety of elements from (a) to (f) that constitute \"quality services\" which must be delivered to clients.  Because the word \"and\" connects clauses (e) and (f), this means that all items on the list must be complied with</li> <li> All of the above.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Ihab is an Iranian citizen currently studying engineering at the University of British Columbia.  He has been trying to get the necessary police certificate to prepare for his Express Entry application for over a year now.  He has encountered one obstacle after another with Iranian authorities.  Your client Ghada \u2013 also from Iran \u2013 had similar problems but finally figured out a way to do it.  You would like to put Ihab in touch with Ghada to discuss it. Under the principles of client confidentiality, it is correct to say that:</p> <ul> <li> Seeking Ghada's consent to help another client is never appropriate</li> <li> You know Ghada would not object and would likely be happy to help, making this a case of implied consent to pass on her contact information</li> <li> This is not possible, as conveying contact information of a client is a breach of confidentiality</li> <li> This would not be a breach of confidentiality if Ghada consents to her contact information being shared for this purpose  What is otherwise a breach of confidentiality can be overcome by simply seeking the client's (or former client's) consent.  This is contemplated in s 28(2)(a).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>When referring to formal legal materials such as a statute, regulation or judicial decision, there are standard protocols (called \u201ccitation\u201d) for how to reference it correctly in a formal written document to ensure that legal readers can locate the source material if they wish. Although there are different legal citation systems used in the Canadian legal sector, the GDipICL program uses the McGill Guide for formal written assignments (not necessary for informal uses like the Discussion Board).   According to the McGill Guide summarized in \u201cCiting Regulations\u201d in Module 1, which sentence below has fully correct citation when referencing our Code:</p> <ul> <li> According to Section 3, the Code applies to RCICs whether they charge fees or not.</li> <li> Section 22 (1)(a) requires an RCIC to meet deadlines.</li> <li> Section 22 (3) (a) would require an RCIC to notify clients of any correspondence they receive from IRCC on their file.</li> <li> According to section 1(1)(b) of the Code, a person can be a client despite even without a written agreement with the RCIC.  This has the proper spacing in the provision (no spaces), the use of the lower case \"s\" for \"section\" and italics for the word \"Code\".</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The field of immigration consulting first became a regulated profession in 2004, when the federal government created the first regulatory body, CSIC.  This followed a key decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in 2001 called the Mangat case. The reason the Mangat case was so important was because:</p> <ul> <li> the Court granted approval for CSIC (Canadian Society of Immigration Consultants) to be established</li> <li> the Court determined that the federal government's jurisdiction to regulate immigration consultants was paramount over the provincial jurisdiction to regulate professions</li> <li> the provincial law societies were given permission to regulate immigration consultants</li> <li> the Supreme Court created the CICC (College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Hyungee is excited to be starting up her immigration consulting business.  She will focus on student recruitment from Korea.  She cannot believe her good fortune when a famous fashion model in Korea, Kim Hee Jeong, contacts her to ask about a study permit.  During the initial consultation, Hyungee determines that Kim is a great candidate to start a fashion design course at Vancouver College.  They enter into a service agreement to commence the study permit application. The next week at a conference of education agents, Hyungee runs into other Korean RCICs. \"You will not believe who I am representing\", she exclaimed \u2013 the famous Kim Hee Jeong!\" You overheard this and correctly determine that:</p> <ul> <li> This is a breach of confidentiality</li> <li> This is not a breach of confidentiality as everyone else at the conference are also professionals and will treat it as confidential</li> <li> This is not a breach of confidentiality because no information was disclosed about Kim's application</li> <li> This is not a breach of confidentiality because Kim is already famous and in the public eye</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>You have an immigration practice in Prince George in which you largely serve the Philippine community.  Your friend from the community association, Flora Negano, is very active in the community, always trying to help immigrants from the Philippines and their relatives wanting to come here. At a Christmas party, your assistant told her Flora's own cousin Imee Negano had inquired about possible immigration. Flora is thrilled and calls you the next day to see if it is true and how she can help. The ethical issues are:</p> <ul> <li> None, as you yourself did not breach confidentiality</li> <li> A breach of confidentiality by staff</li> <li> A breach of confidentiality and likely failure to train staff properly.</li> <li> None, because Imee is not yet a client  Confidentiality is owed to potential clients as well who approach you for possible services.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>In general, it is considered a breach of confidentiality to discuss your client's identity or any other identifying details about their immigration case with:</p> <ul> <li> your spouse</li> <li> another RCIC at your immigration firm</li> <li> your paralegal at the office</li> <li> an immigration officer  The client has not authorized you to discuss the matter with your family, so that is a breach of s 28(1) \u2013 no exceptions under 28(2) apply.</li> </ul> </li> </ol>","tags":["ICL820","Notes","Quizzes"]},{"location":"immigration/820/ICL820week2/","title":"Week 2: Communications","text":"","tags":["ICL820","Notes","Quizzes"]},{"location":"immigration/820/ICL820week2/#notes","title":"Notes","text":"Citing Regulations <ul> <li>Studies show that 55% of your communication is body language, while 38% is pacing and tonality of voice.

This is a legitimate promise and can be reflected in the service agreement.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>One question on every immigration application asks whether the applicant has ever had any criminal convictions. Your client Yuri tells you he was convicted of impaired driving in Russia 20 years ago. He does not want to disclose it and knows it is too old to show up on his record. He will order his criminal record but is certain this will not show. Your best response to Yuri is:</p> <ul> <li> Wait and see what is on the record to determine if it must be disclosed</li> <li> Yuri must disclose it whether it appears on his official record or not</li> <li> If it is not on the official record, he can safely answer that he has no convictions</li> <li> It is Yuri's decision.

Correct. See s 1(1)(c). Also see the explanation in S. Patricia Knight, \"The Paralegal-Client Relationship\" at page 78.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Mustafa, an RCIC in Leamington, Ontario, answers his own phone calls. One day Mustafa received a call from a farm worker for Joshua Tomato Products identifying himself as Dominic. Before Mustafa could get a word in edgewise, Dominic blurted out in broken English how cruel his employer was to himself and the other workers. The employer makes deductions from their paychecks for \"slow work\" and coffee breaks, against their employment contract. He wants Mustafa's help him find a new employer. Mustafa does not work in employment immigration and usually makes a referral in these types of cases. He has not yet said anything to Dominic. Does Mustafa, through this brief phone call, owe any professional duties to Dominic?</p> <ul> <li> No, as Dominic is not a client under the definition in the Code.</li> <li> Yes, by calling Mustafa with personal facts, Dominic has become a client, so all professional duties are owed.</li> <li> No, because Mustafa has not offered to provide services.</li> <li> Yes, because limited duties are owed to potential clients, such as confidentiality and avoiding conflicts of interest. Correct. The Code does not spell out specific duties to potential clients (with the exception of the Consultation Agreement provision in section 23); however, in the legal sector, these two duties apply. See S. Patricia Knight, \"The Paralegal-Client Relationship\" at page 68.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Which one of these parties would be considered a current client under section 1(1) of Code of Professional Conduct?</p> <ul> <li> A person who came for a consultation but decided not to retain you for their Express Entry application.</li> <li> A person who called your office being held in immigration detention, and spoke to your assistant about his case to seek help.</li> <li> The uncle of a refugee claimant who is paying your fees to represent his nephew at a refugee hearing.</li> <li> A consultation client whom you verbally agreed to represent on their study permit, but are awaiting the service agreement you sent them to sign. Correct. Although they are not a client under s 1(1)(a), they are a client under 1(1)(b). After a consultation and the RCIC's agreement to provide services, they must be treated as a client. As you have no service agreement yet, this requires clear communication to sign it by a certain date if they wish to retain you. Otherwise, your obligations could be ongoing under section 1(1)(c).</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Chioma is an RCIC in Winnipeg. She received an email from Claudia about sponsoring her parents for permanent residence. Claudia believes they qualify based on IRCC's website but has a few questions. Chioma replied by email offering to meet with Claudia the following week at a mutually acceptable time for a consultation fee of $200 CAD, including gst. The next step is for Chioma to:</p> <ul> <li> Send Claudia a draft Consultation Agreement for signing before the meeting.</li> <li> Conduct the consultation, and, during the meeting, have Claudia sign the Consultation Agreement.</li> <li> After the meeting, send Claudia a Consultation Agreement for signing.</li> <li> Not worry about a Consultation Agreement - none is needed as the details were confirmed in writing by email. Correct. See section 23(1) - this is necessary before the consultation.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Kwame has operated his own immigration practice in Regina for three years. He works mostly in economic immigration, bringing foreign workers to Canada temporarily and permanently. He sometimes renews their PR cards and applies for citizenship for those who qualify. His database of former clients is growing by the hundreds every year. One day at an immigration conference Kwame learned about ongoing duties to these past clients. He is taken by surprise as he cannot possibly remember all these people over the years. He decides to create an electronic system for all past clients to ensure he can search them easily. Regarding former clients, Kwame must:</p> <ul> <li> Maintain confidentiality and not take cases against their interests on related matters.</li> <li> For five years, respect the confidentiality of their immigration affairs.</li> <li> Contact them if immigration law or policy changes affecting their status.</li> <li> After closing their file, not contact them further. Correct. These duties apply to former clients \u2013 see 28(1) for confidentiality; for conflicts of interest, see section 15(2)(b) as well as the definition of a conflict in s 1(2) which both refer to former clients.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>A consultant must terminate a service agreement where:</p> <ul> <li> The client has not paid the fees.</li> <li> The client's medical exam reveals an unexpected kidney condition and the consultant has a colleague who can assist.</li> <li> The client asks to transfer their file to another consultant who speaks their language.</li> <li> The client suggests he would prefer not to disclose on his forms that he has a child from another relationship because it is past history and his current wife is not aware. Correct. If the client wishes to terminate for any reason, then the consultant must terminate their services \u2013 see s 35(1)(a). A client does not need any grounds at all to discharge you.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Julie Trinh made a consultation appointment with you to discuss extending her visitor status.

Correct - this is the key. To ensure she is giving consent voluntarily [called 'authorization under s 28(2)(a)] to the attendance of each person, it is best to ask her privately about each one seeking to attend.</li> </ul> </li> </ol>","tags":["ICL820","Notes","Quizzes"]},{"location":"immigration/820/ICL820week3/","title":"Week 3: Competence and Scope of Practice","text":"","tags":["ICL820","Notes","Quizzes"]},{"location":"immigration/820/ICL820week3/#notes","title":"Notes","text":"Tutorial notes <ul> <li>Case Study 1: Potential Misrepresentation<ul> <li>Group 1: What is the first point at which a competency issue arises in this scenario?

This is not a referral, as the RCIC continues to remain involved and both professionals will handle the matter for the client in the manner agreed upon.

Vladimir is now being screened for admissibility by IRCC.  He served as a high-ranking officer in the Serbian army during the Bosnian war, all of which is disclosed on his military history form.   IRCC sent a procedural fairness letter alleging Vladimir may be inadmissible for human or international rights violations under s. 35 of IRPA due to his military history. He has 30 days to respond.   Sergio responds with more explanations from the client doing his best as this is his first s. 35 case.  The application is refused for inadmissibility.  At what point in time should Sergio have recognized his own lack of competency?</p> <ul> <li> At the initial consultation</li> <li> Upon completing the forms answering the military questions.</li> <li> Upon receiving the procedural fairness letter.</li> <li> Upon getting the refusal. Correct. Answering questions about military history of an officer from a war-torn region with known human rights abuses raises issues of competency, ie knowing the impact of the client's military role.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>There are many standard ways for a consultant to gain competence in a potential new area of practice.  However, other strategies for acquiring competency in a new area should be avoided.  A poor way to learn to apply for an LMIA (Labour Market Impact Assessment), a complex application, would be through:</p> <ul> <li> referring the LMIA to an experienced practitioner to represent, while you work on it pro bono to learn.</li> <li> when you have opportunity to take your first case, inform the the client you will find co-counsel to assist as per s 20(1)(b).</li> <li> taking seminars and researching as much as possible.</li> <li> finding an experienced RCIC to jointly take on the file with you. This is not an effective way to learn LMIAs. Seminars and research can suffice in areas that are an adjunct to your current practice but are unlikely to make you competent in a major new specialized area. Remember, you need experience as well as knowledge.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The scope of an RCIC's licence will be determined by the class of licence they are granted by the licensing body.  The licensing body, in the case of immigration consultants, is the College.  The College's legal authority to grant and revoke licences is established by:</p> <ul> <li> section 91(1)(c) of IRPA.</li> <li> the College Act.</li> <li> section 21.1(2)(c) of the Citizenship Act.</li> <li> the Board of Directors of the College. Correct. The College and its mandate are established under the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants Act, S.C. 2019, c 29, s 292 (the College Act).  Section 2 defines the maximum scope of a licence of an immigration and citizenship consultant, and the College can and does also issue restricted licences.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Peter is an immigration consultant in Calgary and has worked in the field for 20 years.   Before that, he was an immigration officer with IRCC for 10 years, mostly assigned to H&amp;C cases.  For the past two decades his practice has largely focused on corporate immigration and foreign workers, namely employment-related immigration.  Which type of case is most likely outside Peter's scope of practice?</p> <ul> <li> The City of Calgary's request to hire an architect if he has never processed an architect.</li> <li> A humanitarian and compassionate case on medical grounds.</li> <li> A refugee case.</li> <li> All of the above. Correct.  He has never worked in this area and has only limited knowledge. It is a complex area, which is not easy to learn quickly by reading when you have no background or experience. He would not be competent.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Claire Lavoie, an RCIC working in Newfoundland, specializes in obtaining permanent residence for foreign workers and their families.  She is representing a USA citizen, Hans Heinen, who qualifies in the Canadian Experience Class.   Claire sent Hans her standard questionnaire to fill out with all the information needed for the forms and process. He replied \"None\" so Claire took his case. However, when his FBI  certificate came back, he had a conviction for DUI in Idaho in 2014 with a minor penalty.   This raises several issues for Claire, as she does not feel competent to advise him on the impact of the criminal record.  Claire might have avoided this situation by:</p> <ul> <li> not taking the case.</li> <li> insist Charles get his FBI  certificate before entering into a service agreement.</li> <li> a more robust screening process regarding criminal records.</li> <li> it was probably not avoidable. Correct.  Given the consequences of any past criminal charges to the case, more upfront steps are needed to avoid this situation, such as more detailed questions; the phrase \"criminal record\" is open to interpretation and does not reflect the exact questions on immigration forms; more specificity and probing is needed.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Alice Huang is preparing a family class sponsorship for a Canadian citizen who is sponsoring her husband Francois Gerard for permanent residence.  When Francois' police certificate came back, it showed a conviction for theft in Paris in 2006.  Francois is adamant he has no criminal record and it must be a case of mistaken identity.  This is Alice's first encounter with this problem.   As a first step, her best course of action is to:</p> <ul> <li> submit the record to IRCC with an explanation about mistaken identity and see what happens.</li> <li> insist the client own up to it otherwise she will not represent them.</li> <li> seek the client's permission to discuss the record with a colleague knowledgeable about French police certificates.</li> <li> cease representing the client. Correct.  This is permitted under s 20(1)(b), and a sensible first step as it is possible there is a known issue, or process to pursue or a simple solution. The client's consent is needed due to the likely necessity to use names.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Immigration consultants are not permitted to provide any immigration advice or services outside the scope of their RCIC licence. Which of the following matters would be outside the scope of an RCIC's licence?</p> <ul> <li> Asking an immigration officer to re-consider a study permit refusal.</li> <li> Making a citizenship application for a child born abroad.</li> <li> Advising an unsuccessful applicant on the merits of judicial review in Federal Court.</li> <li> Exploring options for a foreign worker is who is out of status. Correct \u2013 Advising on any Federal Court matters is outside the scope on any RCIC licence.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>An RCIC who receives an email from a potential client requesting help with a sponsorship appeal when they do not work in that area may take the following action:</p> <ul> <li> forward the email to a colleague who does these appeals.</li> <li> ask the potential client if they would like a referral.</li> <li> contact a capable colleague to see if they would pay a referral fee for the case.</li> <li> tell the client you do not work in this area but could learn it if desired, as it is within the scope of your licence. Although honest, you cannot learn a whole new complex area of practice this way, and so are not competent to enter a service agreement for it</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Johan is a new practitioner who recently opened his office in Brandon, Manitoba, hoping to build up his practice in employment immigration. He has been conducting outreach to numerous companies in the agricultural sector across western Canada offering to provide services.  Johan took on a case for a Saskatchewan hog producer, not realizing the province has additional requirements for representatives bringing foreign workers to that province, which credentials he does not have and cannot quickly obtain.

Justyna advised her client Kuldeep that he could obtain his new work permit at the border. But Kuldeep was out of status and was not eligible for a work permit at the border.  Instead, the border officer issued Kuldeep an Exclusion Order banning him from Canada for one year since he was out of status. Kuldeep sought advice from a lawyer about whether he could sue Justyna in civil court for compensation to recover his losses and obtain damages. The answer is:</p> <ul> <li> No, his only remedy is a complaint to the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants.</li> <li> Yes, provided Justyna agreed to this in the service agreement.</li> <li> Yes, that is what RCICs have Errors and Omissions insurance for.</li> <li> No, his only remedy is to commence a Judicial Review to overturn the Exclusion Order.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Maryam represents Vijay and his spouse Leesa on their spousal sponsorship application.

During the process of preparing the file, Vijay disclosed to Maryam privately that he had just been diagnosed with liver cancer but does not want Leesa to know this yet \u2013 he might tell her later, when he is ready. He has not decided yet. This situation requires Maryam to:</p> <ul> <li> Inform Leesa herself without Vijay's knowledge.</li> <li> Withdraw as their representative due to the conflict of interest.</li> <li> Inform Vijay that he must tell Leesa or else she will be required to do so.</li> <li> Keep Vijay's information confidential. <p>the conflict is still potential, not actual, and may be resolved if Vijay tells Leesa now.

Haining tells the class she has seen various ads and videos on Tik Tok and other Chinese social media where RCICs are talking about their successful cases. For example, one RCIC posted a video about a difficult study permit he was able to obtain for a client. He included several facts such as the client\u2019s name, age, education, country, etc. Haining asked her classmates if this would be a breach of confidentiality. The most correct response would be:</p> <ul> <li> It is not a breach of confidentiality if the RCIC obtained either written or verbal consent from the client.</li> <li> It is not a breach of confidentiality where the case was successful.</li> <li> Because a client cannot consent to have their information made public on social media, it would always be a breach of confidentiality.</li> <li> It is not a breach of confidentiality as long as the information is fully accurate.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>An RCIC who holds a Class L2 (Restricted Practice) licence from the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants is permitted to undertake all of the cases below, except one.

As part of the duty of competence, an RCIC must:</p> <ul> <li> have relevant experience on matters they are advising clients about.</li> <li> do the work without charge if they are not fully competent when commencing a file.</li> <li> use the latest software programs on the market.</li> <li> provide services in the language of the client.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Banto agreed to assist his fellow RCIC Aboake when Aboake took a brief medical leave. Banto agreed to handle any urgent matters for free. One client, Maria, consented to this, despite having to travel across town to see Banto, because her matter was urgent and she wanted Aboake to remain her representative.  Banto prepared the updated forms as requested by IRCC, had Maria sign them, collected evidence and wrote a submission letter to address the officer's concerns, and sent the package on Aboake\u2019s behalf to Canada Immigration.  There was no service agreement and Aboake did not see the package.  Banto\u2019s professional relationship to Maria is:</p> <ul> <li> Maria is not Banto's client because Maria already has an authorized representative on the file, Aboake.</li> <li> Maria is Banto's client because he is responsible for deciding what information, evidence and submissions to file.</li> <li> Maria is not Banto's client because he is not charging and has no written service agreement with her.</li> <li> Maria is Banto's client because he is preparing her forms and submitting the package. <p>Preparing forms and submitting the package does not by itself create a consultant-client relationship; these tasks are usually done by staff and supervised by a licensed person.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Wahid is an RCIC who specializes in refugee cases.

However, 3 days before the hearing, Gonzalo was informed by his bank that the cheque had bounced. He contacted the client who told him the reason was that he decided to fire Gonzalo effective immediately and had an appointment that afternoon with new counsel.\u202fUpon hearing this, what is Gonzalo's situation under the Code of Professional Conduct?</p> <ul> <li> He cannot end the service agreement for non-payment as it would prejudice the client.</li> <li> He can end the service agreement but only after he hears from new counsel, to ensure the client is not prejudiced.</li> <li> He cannot end the service agreement for non-payment because he cannot give reasonable notice.</li> <li> He must end the service agreement immediately as the client has discharged him.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The Code of Professional Conduct requires RCICs to keep clients informed about the status of their file.  This obligation includes the fact that an RCIC must:</p> <ul> <li> contact the client, preferably by phone, when a letter is received from the government on their file.</li> <li> inform the client in writing once they have submitted the client's application.</li> <li> notify the client by email within 30 days that correspondence was received.</li> <li> if correspondence is received, decide whether to inform the client.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>There are many acronyms used in the field of immigration. A good example is the acronym \u201cIRPA\u201d which those working in this field recognize as the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Similarly, many agencies working in the immigration and refugee sector are also known by their acronyms.

Sahani\u2019s template will leave fields for the name and contact information of the potential client. There will be a signature line at the bottom with the date for Sahani and the client to sign. She plans to charge $250 for an Initial Consultation. In addition to the above, her Consultation Agreement will say: \u201cThe RCIC agrees to provide an initial consultation to the client for immigration advice for a fee of $250\u201d.  Will her template satisfy the Code requirements?</p> <ul> <li> No, because it does not adequately describe what the consultation will be about.</li> <li> Yes, because it includes all the information needed.</li> <li> No, because she needs a full-service agreement before providing any services.</li> <li> No, because initial consultations should be provided free of charge. <p>Correct - the consultation agreement is required to include the purpose and scope of the consultation as per s. 23(2)(e).

However, he was unable to read the English translation of those dates into the Gregorian calendar, or to verify the accuracy of the translated dates as they were interpreted to him at the port of entry and in his counsel\u2019s office. He therefore had to rely on Ms. Leggett in that regard.

The platform currently in use is called \"Chinook\", which allows for targeting, compiling and presenting data to officers from across multiple client applications \u2013 for example, it is possible to see all applications from a certain country or region, or a demographic factor such as ethnic group, age or religion - any characteristic of interest to the officer with the aim of making decisions more efficiently.</li> <li>Pulling certain groups of applications also allows IRCC to identify patterns not otherwise visible, for example concerning the work of a certain representative, or evidence that a \u2018ghost consultant\u2019 may be involved in the files.</li> <li>Cases at the Federal Court have begun to challenge Chinook, but as yet no applicants have been able to show that an officer\u2019s discretion was fettered by use of this tool in a way that undermined procedural fairness.</li> <li>Khosravi v.

I do not know if the shortcomings outlined above result from the use of this tool. I will simply say that the use of assisted decision-making tools does not relieve officers from the duty to fully consider an application, most importantly the study plan. If the use of such a tool gives the officer a truncated vision of the application, the resulting decision may well be unreasonable.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Raja v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2023 FC 719 (CanLII)<ul> <li>[30] I agree with the Respondent. While it was open to the Applicant to raise the ways that the Chinook processing tool specifically resulted in a breach of procedural fairness in the Officer\u2019s assessment of his case, he has not provided any evidence of such a connection. I would also note that the Chinook tool is not intended to process, assess evidence, or make decisions on applications, and the Applicant has failed to raise any evidence countering this or demonstrating that the tool impacts the fairness of the decision-making process.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Section 99(1)(a) of the Customs Act, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (2nd Supp.) currently allows border officers to examine any \u201cgoods\u201d carried by the traveler.

(See the IRCC page entitled \"Find out if you need a medical exam\")</li> <li>Coming to Canada to work in a job in which public health must be protected (see \"Jobs for which you need a medical exam\")</li> <li>Applying for a parent and grandparent super visa</li> </ul> </li> <li>Information to share with your clients before they appear at the POE:<ul> <li>Know the nature and contents of the application they are making. The questions they will be asked will depend on what they are applying for. For example, visitors will be asked who they are coming to visit, where they will stay and for how long, who will pay for their expenses, etc. Workers will be asked where they will be working, how they are qualified for the job, etc.</li> <li>Answer the questions honestly and completely. Suspicious answers may lead to additional questioning. If a client does not understand a question, they should ask the CBSA officer to repeat it instead of answering in a way that can be misconstrued.</li> <li>CBSA officers can search any digital devices that the client has. As a result, clients should ensure before travelling that the devices they are bringing do not contain any information that contradicts the information provided in their application or the answers they give at the POE.</li> <li>Carefully check the permit issued at the POE. If there are any errors or spelling mistakes, ask the CBSA officer to correct the permit. This is much easier than getting the permit amended after leaving the POE.</li> <li>If applying for a work permit or a study permit that allows work off campus, ask the CBSA officer if the Social Insurance Number (SIN) can be issued at the POE. Service Canada kiosks are available at some POEs.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Visitor status usually expires six months after the foreign national enters Canada, unless the CBSA officer issues a Visitor Record for a different duration or writes a different expiry date under the entry stamp in the passport.</li> <li>If a client applies extension before their visitor status expires but does not receive a decision on the application before their status expiry date, the client is permitted to stay in Canada until they receive a decision on the application. This is now referred to as maintained status by IRCC, and used to be called implied status.</li> <li>If your client loses temporary resident status in Canada, either because they did not apply for an extension before their status expired or because their application was refused, they can apply to restore their status or they must leave Canada.</li> <li>Options after Refusal:<ul> <li>If your client is in Canada, they may be able to apply for restoration or they must leave Canada. It is important to remember that your client has lost status when their application was refused. They are only permitted to apply for restoration if they are in Canada. If they leave Canada after applying for restoration, they cannot have their status restored.</li> <li>Reconsideration request is a request made to the processing office asking the decision-maker or a supervisor to take a closer look at the documents provided with the application or a request to reconsider the negative decision based on new evidence that addresses the reasons for the refusal. For example, if a visitor visa is refused because of the applicant\u2019s limited travel history, but the applicant\u2019s passport shows numerous travel stamps, a reconsideration request can highlight the evidence that was overlooked.</li> <li>Application for leave and for judicial review to the Federal Court can challenge a refused application. If the refusal is inside Canada, the applicant has 15 days to start the Federal Court application. If the refusal is outside Canada, the applicant has 60 days to start the Federal Court application. It is important to note that a successful judicial review application in the Federal Court will result in the application being returned to the processing office to be reconsidered by a different decision-maker, which does not ensure that the application will be approved. It is possible to submit both a reconsideration request and the Federal Court application for leave and judicial review. However, please note that the reconsideration request may not be decided if Federal Court litigation is also commenced.</li> <li>Re-applying may be quicker and more cost-effective than applying for leave and judicial review. If a new temporary residence application is submitted, better supporting documents should be included if available and the reasons for refusal should be addressed. The processing fees will need to be paid again.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>","tags":["ICL830","Notes","Quizzes"]},{"location":"immigration/830/ICL830week1/#quizzes","title":"Quizzes","text":"Module 1: Knowledge Check - Cochran's Interviewing Skills (Chapter 8) Quiz <ol> <li> <p>John, an experienced immigration consultant based in Canada, was approached by a client, Maria, who sought assistance with her permanent residency application under the Express Entry system.

Is EDSC obligated to process the new LMIA for the bakery?</p> <ul> <li> Yes, because they have had successful LMIAs in the past and the foreign workers are already working at the bakery.</li> <li> Yes, because they are a high-end bakery and employs 6 Canadians whose employment would be in jeopardy if the new LMIA is not approved.</li> <li> No, because less than 10 Canadians on staff and 20 are required for further LMIAs</li> <li> No, because they have been noncompliant in previous LMIAs <p>See  R209.95(1), R209.997(1) &amp; (2)</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Joanna is short of seamstresses for her sewing and craft store.

She realizes she needs to properly advertise and maybe even apply for something called an \"LMIA.\" She knows there is a book of occupations and needs help find that book and the right code. What is the name of that book, and the right code (You have to look it up!) It should be noted a new version of this book will be released very soon!</p> <ul> <li> CCDO \u2013 Code 7411</li> <li> Merriam Webster Dictionary \u2013 seamstress definition</li> <li> National Occupational Classification NOC 2021 64200</li> <li> National Occupational Classification NOC 2016 6242</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Jeffrey owns a restaurant in British Columbia and is having a hard time hiring any Canadians or permanent residents. He is trying to understand the process to bring foreign workers to Canada. He is not sure of the difference between median hourly wage and minimum hourly wage. Pick the best answer to describe median wage.</p> <ul> <li> The median wage is the single national wage established by the Federal Government for all occupations.</li> <li> The median wage is a number set by the provinces based on the demand for a particular occupation.</li> <li> The median wage is used as a determinate for either the high wage or a low wage stream if an employer must apply for a LMIA</li> <li> The median wage is established by the province and is the same as minimum provincial wage</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Hilda Fruit Farms, based in Nova Scotia, has recently expanded farming operations. They have 3000 acres of crops that needs to be harvested and urgently needs to bring in workers for the late spring, summer and fall season. Hilda is hoping to bring in workers from St. Lucia as she has a good friend who can recruit some workers. What and why might be the best course of action for Hilda in bringing in these workers?</p> <ul> <li> Apply for LMIAs through the agricultural stream so they can work for 24 months</li> <li> Use low wage skill LMIA to bring the workers as farm workers make less than median wage</li> <li> Have them apply for TRVs as they are only working seasonally</li> <li> Apply for LMIAs through the seasonal agricultural program as the seasonal workers are from a participating country</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>ESDC states there are certain conditions why an LMIA application may NOT be processed.  Which of these can not be one of the reasons?</p> <ul> <li> Ineligible employers who have found to be noncompliant in a compliance review</li> <li> Because of long delays in processing</li> <li> Low wage positions are above the cap</li> <li> Certain positions are in the accommodation, food service or retail trade sectors</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Joanne is a Canadian employer and wants to hire some foreign nationals. She has advertised extensively for several positions and cannot find any Canadian citizens or permanent residents qualified for these jobs. She wonders why ESDC will want to review if her LMIA will have positive or neutral impact and she asks in her example what the impact could be?</p> <ul> <li> An ESDC officer will review the LMIA and determine if there are any available Canadians or permanent residents for the position and ascertain if there will be a positive (need to bring foreign workers), neutral, or negative (available Canadian/PRs) impact on the labour market.</li> <li> An IRCC officer will review the LMIA and determine if there are any available Canadians or permanent residents for the position and ascertain if there will be a positive (need to bring foreign workers), or neutral (no) impact on the labour market.</li> <li> An ESDC officer will review the LMIA and determine if there available Canadians, permanent residents, or foreign nationals available for the position and ascertain the impact on the labour market.</li> <li> An ESDC officer will review LMIA and resumes of those applying and determine if there any qualified persons for the position and then determine the impact on the labour market. <p>See R203(1)(b) &amp; (2.1) &amp; (3)</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Charmaine is the owner of a private school. She has recently submitted an LMIA application for the Principal position at her school. She provides the following details. She advertised for the position on the Job Bank, Vancouver Star, indeed.ca and in Canadian teacher's publications.  The wages being offered are just under $100,000 per year. The hiring of the new Principal means that the school will be able to operate and retain 5 Canadian teachers and enrollment of 65 Canadian /permanent resident students. The job is genuine in nature and Charmaine advises that those who have applied are not qualified for the position, and as such a labour shortage is being filled. She further advised that the teachers and previous Principal have formed a union and are striking in front of the school. She has fired the old Principal and is eager to have school open again. On what basis might Charmaine's LMIA be refused?</p> <ul> <li> The advertising is insufficient.</li> <li> The wages are below median.</li> <li> The employment of a foreign national may have an adverse effect on the labour dispute.</li> <li> The employment of the foreign national will not assist in retaining Canadians. <p>See R203(1.1)</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Julia requires a project manager with a specific skill set to assist in a new project her company has undertaken. The job entails both a civil engineering and IT skill set. She has advertised in a number of places with mostly unqualified candidates applying. She wishes to apply for a LMIA in the high wage stream. She advises she has posted job ads in the following places: Indeed, Globe &amp; Mail, Canadian Civil Engineer Magazine, Kijii, and various community centres.

Her last LMIA was approved 20 months ago, and she now is ready to submit a new one as she has recently acquired some new contracts and there is a shortage of qualified personnel for the positions. She has advertised extensively in Canada and has had two people, who are in Canada, as visitors apply. Both are qualified for the job. Jane wonders what she needs to show to verify the business and job offer(s) are legitimate.</p> <ul> <li> She must provide translation contracts and proof of advertising.</li> <li> She may need to provide letters of employment to the two foreign nationals.</li> <li> She may be exempted from having to provide some documents because she has had a positive LMIA within the last two years.</li> <li> None of the above <p>Program requirements for high-wage positions</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Jeffrey's restaurant has recently expanded, and they are very busy. He needs 2 restaurant managers and 2 cooks. He knows it is very difficult to find Canadians or permanent residents for these positions. He is getting ready to start the process of possible LMIAs and decides that he will pay the two managers $30.00/hour and the two cooks $19.00/hour. You conduct a wage review and discover that the prevailing wage for the manager position is $26.50/hr while the cook position is $15.50/hr. You also discover that the provincial/territorial median is $29.50/hr. Which streams would each LMIA fall within and why?</p> <ul> <li> All 4 positions would be processed in the stream for high wage, because they are between the minimum provincial/territorial and median wages.</li> <li> The wages offered for the two positions for cooks are above the prevailing wage and meet the stream for high wage.  The wages offered for the two positions for restaurant managers are above the prevailing wage and meet the stream of high wage.</li> <li> All 4 positions would be processed in the stream for low wage because one of the two wages are below the provincial/territorial median.</li> <li> The wages offered for the two positions for cooks are below the median wage and meet the stream for low wage.  The wages offered for the two positions for restaurant managers are above the median wage and meet the stream of high wage. <p>Starting November 8, 2024, the provincial and territorial wage threshold used to determine the application stream will be increased by 20%. Consult the Wage threshold by province or territory table below for details.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>LMIAs are used for a variety of different streams and programs.

As well they have acquired several mink farms. The farm workers on staff do not have the experience nor knowledge in maple syrup harvesting nor that in raising or dealing with mink. Lori Robinson, farm manager, has business dealings with Alex Trkulja from Latvia who specializes in both mink production and maple syrup production. He has offered to send some of his experienced workers in exchange for a share of the profit from the crops. Lori is intrigued but knows that she first must ensure that there are no qualified Canadians/PRs who can do the job but is making inquiries on how she might be able to bring these workers. **What might be the best way to bring these workers and why? **</p> <ul> <li> LMIA based specialized work permits based on the skilled workers needed</li> <li> LMIA through the agricultural stream as production is in the commodity sector</li> <li> PNP job offers from Robinson Farms is the most efficient way to bring the workers</li> <li> TRV is probably the best option as payment is only a share of the profits</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <ol> <li> <p>Underrepresented groups include Indigenous persons, vulnerable youth, newcomers, and persons with disabilities.

There was an unfortunate delay in the application\u2019s processing. In fact, the visa post closed down and the application had to be transferred. The couple hasn\u2019t been together for some time now and Thomas would like his spouse to come to Canada on a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) for the winter holiday. His spouse just lost her job in her home country, and he would like to be with her to support her. He is worried that his spouse\u2019s application for Permanent Residence which is still in progress, might cause the refusal of the Temporary Resident Visa (TRV). Which of the following is most likely the reason the spouse\u2019s TRV could be refused?</p> <ul> <li> Because a foreign national is not allowed to have two applications in progress at the same time.</li> <li> Because the spouse has an application for Permanent Residence in progress, and her intention is to stay permanently in Canada which contradicts with the purpose of her visit.</li> <li> Because the spouse is not a genuine visitor and is not in a genuine relationship.</li> <li> Because the spouse might not leave Canada if her Permanent Residence application is refused. <p>Pursuant to s. 22(2) of the IRPA, Thomas' spouse has \"dual intent.\" While it may be a challenge in a spousal sponsorship application, Thomas can address his wife's dual intention by informing the officer that she will abide by the rules as a temporary resident (if approved) and that should her PR application be refused, she would be compelled to return to her home country since she has no other significant ties to Canada other than him.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Salam is a citizen of France, where he currently resides.

Most importantly, the application must include evidence that clearly demonstrates the company\u2019s ability to become established in Canada.</li> <li>Five Tips for Success:<ul> <li>A well-drafted and detailed business plan assists the officer reviewing the work permit application to understand the business that the company will engage in, the benefit to the Canadian economy (in the form of investment, job creation and/or the introduction of new products or services to the Canadian marketplace), and the need for the foreign worker to be able to provide services in Canada.</li> <li>Generally speaking, the company must secure physical premises to house the Canadian operation.</li> <li>There must be a qualifying relationship between the foreign entity that the individual works for and the Canadian operation they are being transferred to. Most commonly, the new Canadian operation will be a branch, subsidiary or affiliate of the foreign company.</li> <li>When reviewing an application for a transferee seeking to work at a new Canadian operation the officer will want to see evidence of the new company\u2019s ability to meet its financial obligations to workers and others. As such, the ability of the foreign parent company or affiliate to financially support the Canadian company until it can generate revenue is crucial.</li> <li>While it is possible to extend the validity of the work permit at the end of the one-year period, the employer must be able to provide proof that the Canadian operation has met the expectations set out in its business plan during the year that the foreign worker has been in Canada.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>C13 \u2013 Emergency Repair:<ul> <li>Purpose of exemption: Emergency repair personnel are persons whose admission is required in Canada to carry out emergency repairs to industrial or commercial equipment in order to prevent disruption of employment regardless of whether the equipment is under warranty.</li> <li>Two streams:<ul> <li>Emergency Repair Personnel: to complete emergency repairs to commercial equipment to prevent the disruption of operations and employment, regardless of whether the equipment is out of warranty.</li> <li>Repair Personnel for out of warranty equipment: to repair commercial equipment that is no longer under warranty or covered by an after-sales service agreement, but is necessary to prevent serious interruptions to productivity</li> </ul> </li> <li>Usually issued for short duration</li> <li>Required Reading: International Mobility Program: Canadian interests \u2013 Significant benefit \u2013 Emergency repair personnel or repair personnel for out-of-warranty equipment [R205(a)] (exemption code C13), online.</li> </ul> </li> <li>C14 \u2013 Television and Film Production Workers:<ul> <li>Purpose of exemption: Allows for the entry and authorized work of TV and film producers to Canada in order to support Canada\u2019s economic interests and create a significant benefit to Canada\u2019s cultural, social, and economic fabric.</li> <li>Work being performed in Canada must be essential to the TV or film production</li> <li>If position is unionized, union must support the foreign national\u2019s application</li> <li>Irrelevant whether the production is foreign or domestic</li> <li>Required Reading: International Mobility Program: Canadian interests \u2013 Significant benefit \u2013 Television and film production workers [R205(a)] (exemption code C14), online.</li> </ul> </li> <li>C16 \u2013 Francophone Mobility:<ul> <li>Purpose of exemption: To promote Francophone immigration in Francophone minority communities</li> <li>Foreign national must be:<ul> <li>Destined for work outside of Quebec</li> <li>Working in a position classified as NOC 0, A, or B</li> <li>Using French as language of habitual/daily interactions</li> </ul> </li> <li>International Mobility Program (IMP): Canadian interests \u2013 Significant benefit \u2013 Mobilit\u00e9 Francophone [R205(a)] (exemption code C16), online.</li> </ul> </li> <li>C20 \u2013 Reciprocal Employment:<ul> <li>Purpose of exemption: Allows foreign workers to take up employment in Canada when Canadians have similar reciprocal opportunities abroad</li> <li>It is not necessary that there be exact reciprocity (i.e. one for one exchange or the same position), but the general order of magnitude of exchanges should be similar.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> R204(a) \"International agreements and under R205(a) \"Significant benefits\" <p>Specialized knowledge work permit applications can be made under a free trade agreement pursuant to R204 or because issuing the work permit is in Canada\u2019s interests (pursuant to R205).

Read the following cases:<ul> <li>Likhi v Canada (MCI), 2020 FC 171, Online.<ul> <li>[26]  Given the severe consequences of a finding of misrepresentation, namely ineligibility to apply to come to Canada for a 5-year period, Ms. Likhi submits a higher degree of procedural fairness is required to ensure such findings are made only where there is clear and convincing evidence of misrepresentation: Ni v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2010 FC 162 [Ni] at para 18; Lin v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 1284 [Lin] at paras 24-25; Seraj v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 38 [Seraj] at para 1; Lamsen v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 815 at para 24; Bao v Canada (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship), 2019 FC 268 at paras 17-18.</li> <li>[27] ... As noted in Vavilov, above at para 133, the severity of the outcome requires the decision maker\u2019s reasons to reflect the stakes for, and from the perspective of, the affected individual:<ul> <li>It is well established that individuals are entitled to greater procedural protection when the decision in question involves the potential for significant personal impact or harm: Baker, at para. 25. However, this principle also has implications for how a court conducts reasonableness review. Central to the necessity of adequate justification is the perspective of the individual or party over whom authority is being exercised. Where the impact of a decision on an individual\u2019s rights and interests is severe, the reasons provided to that individual must reflect the stakes. The principle of responsive justification means that if a decision has particularly harsh consequences for the affected individual, the decision maker must explain why its decision best reflects the legislature\u2019s intention. This includes decisions with consequences that threaten an individual\u2019s life, liberty, dignity or livelihood. [Bold emphasis added.]</li> </ul> </li> <li>[32] I note credibility, on the one hand, and insufficiency of evidence, on the other, are distinct concepts that should not be conflated, especially when a Visa Officer makes a finding of misrepresentation: Seraj, above at para 18. Findings of insufficiency, in themselves, do not amount automatically to misrepresentations. Rather, a finding of misrepresentation is reasonable only where an applicant is shown to have led incorrect information or omitted material information, intentionally or accidentally, which could have affected Canada\u2019s ability to administer its immigration laws: IRPA s 40(1); Muthui, above at para 27.</li> <li>[33] When determining whether the Senior Officer\u2019s finding of misrepresentation was arrived at in a procedurally fair manner, it is important to clarify whether the Senior Officer\u2019s finding was based on the evidence provided being (a) insufficient to demonstrate a bona fides marriage, as the Minister asserts was the case; or (b) not credible, genuine, or accurate, as Ms. Likhi submits. If the former, the Interviewing Officer was entitled to rely on the fact that the IRPA and IRPR give notice of the evidentiary threshold for proving compliance with Canada\u2019s immigration laws, and thus had no procedural duty to alert Ms. Likhi to concerns of insufficiency in her application: Zhou, above at para 28: Bains, above at para 58. If the latter, the Interviewing Officer did have a duty to bring these concerns to Ms. Likhi\u2019s attention, and to provide her with an adequate opportunity to disabuse the Interviewing Officer of them: Zhou, above at para 29.</li> <li>[44] A principled approach to reasonableness review puts the reasons first, \u201c\u2026by examining the reasons provided with \u2018respectful attention\u2019 and seeking to understand the reasoning process followed by the decision maker to arrive at [the] conclusion\u201d: Vavilov, above at para 84. The focus of reasonableness review, therefore, must be on the decision, including the decision maker\u2019s reasoning process and the outcome. The reviewing court must consider only whether the decision, taking into account the rationale and outcome, was unreasonable, and must avoid substituting its own analysis or preferred decision: Vavilov, above at para 83. As noted by the SCC, \u201c[t]he burden is on the party challenging the decision to show that it is unreasonable. \u2026the court must satisfied that any shortcomings or flaws \u2026 are sufficiently central or significant to render the decision unreasonable\u201d: Vavilov, above at para 100.</li> <li>[45] ... \u201c[W]here reasons are provided but they fail to provide a transparent and intelligible justification ..., the decision will be unreasonable\u201d: Vavilov, above at para 136...</li> </ul> </li> <li>Badial v Canada (MCI), 2020 FC 108, Online.<ul> <li>[12] Both the Applicant and the Respondent agreed that the standard of review applicable to the question of procedural fairness was that of correctness. Both parties also agreed that the standard of review applicable to this Court\u2019s review of the Officer\u2019s assessment of whether the Applicant met the relevant requirements was that of reasonableness.</li> <li>[15] ... The Supreme Court of Canada lists two types of fundamental flaws that make a decision unreasonable: (1) a failure of rationality internal to the decision-maker\u2019s reasoning process; and (2) untenability \u201cin light of the relevant factual and legal constraints that bear on it\u201d (Vavilov, at para 101).</li> <li>[29] The Officer\u2019s reasons and concerns arise directly and obviously from the requirements of the IRPA and the Regulations.

Jaheem entered the country through the International Experience Canada (IEC) program, as part of the International Co-op Placement stream, to work at BLA museum.

She knows they are both also on the employer-specific work permit. One day in April, one of her co-workers is injured by the machinery and has to take three days off. Her co-worker thinks the machinery might be faulty and wants to report it to a government authority for inspection. When ABC Industrials finds this out, they deny her coworker the full month of pay and threaten to deny any future pay if the coworker reports the injury or seeks a medical case. They then threaten any employee who reports this or any other injury with docked pay. Is Mi Kyong eligible for an open work permit?</p> <ul> <li> No, because any abuse being suffered is being suffered by her co-worker and not her.</li> <li> No, because she already has a work permit that allows her to work in Canada.</li> <li> Yes, because her employer is hiring more than the allowed amount of workers on closed work permits.</li> <li> Yes, because her co-worker is suffering abuse by her employer and on these facts, Mi Kyong also appears to be at risk of abuse.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Laviza has just applied for an open work permit under the vulnerable worker's class. Her employer, Ontario Farms, repeatedly withheld payment and would garnish her wages. The company stated that they garnished wages so that they could pay to implement new safety measures, but Laviza has not noticed any new measures in place. She also noticed that her pay cheque was always lower after she made complaints to management about their inconsistent payment schedule. Laviza has described her experience in a letter of explanation and has provided copies of her pay stubs \u2013 is this evidence sufficient to prove her claim?</p> <ul> <li> No, an officer will likely require supporting or additional material to substantiate claims.</li> <li> It depends, it is not the amount of evidence but whether the facts and evidence are credible on a balance of probabilities.</li> <li> It depends, it is not the amount of evidence but whether the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the evidence is credible.</li> <li> Laviza's evidence is likely sufficient. Laviza must undergo an interview with an immigration officer and the evidence gleaned during this interview is much more important.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Tyrone has completed a 2-year program of study at a PGWP eligible Designated Learning Institute (DLI).

The permit is valid for one year. Kasey is worried about not being able to financially support his family while he looks for another job. His eldest child offers to help by getting a part-time job while he completes his university degree. His son has a valid study permit and is enrolled full-time at a designated learning institution. What kind of work permit would you suggest for him?</p> <ul> <li> The son can work without a work permit because he is enrolled full-time in a post-secondary degree.</li> <li> The son cannot hold a work permit and study permit at the same time.

Vijay wanted to be proactive and began applying for jobs before he had received a decision on his application. Vijay comes to you for advice \u2013 he just received a job offer but they want him to start next week. The job is not in the field that Vijay studied in, but he thinks it could still be a great opportunity. Vijay does not know the status of his application. Can Vijay accept the job offer?</p> <ul> <li> Yes, but only if Vijay's study permit is still valid.</li> <li> No, because Vijay would have to work without a valid work permit.</li> <li> No, because the job is in a different field than what Vijay graduated from.</li> <li> Yes, because graduates who apply for a post-graduation work permit are eligible to work full-time while they wait for a decision on their application.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Karl's program of study was four years. When the Designated Learning Institution (DLI) he was studying at lost its designation, Karl transferred to a public post secondary Designated Learning Institution (DLI) . When he switched schools, some of his credits did not transfer properly and Karl had to redo two classes. This meant he was in school for an additional semester, totalling four and a half years. Given this, what is the maximum length Post-Graduate Work Permit (PGWP) that Karl can receive?</p> <ul> <li> Two years, which is the maximum length of time that a PGWP can be issued for</li> <li> Three years, which is the maximum length of time that a PGWP can be issued for</li> <li> Four years, because that was the length of his program</li> <li> Four and a half years, because that was the amount of time that he was enrolled at a DLI</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Ju-long is a migrant worker experiencing abuse in the workplace.

He is a national of Russia and has been living in Canada during the four years his diplomat parent has been stationed here.  Russia stations diplomats for five years, so his diplomat mother will be relocated outside of Canada within one year and her work permit will expire then as well. As Pyotr has just turned 16, he feels he is old enough to work and wants to save some money for the future. He has found a job at the library and wants to know if he can work it. He hopes that if he works there for two years, he will be able to get enough experience and money to pursue becoming a librarian. Can he continue with this plan and get an appropriate work permit?</p> <ul> <li> No, because a library is a civil and public institution and he is not a Canadian national.</li> <li> Yes, but he will only be able to work for two years as he can apply as the family of a foreign representative and he is the same age as a student.</li> <li> No, because he is 16 and would be working under-age.</li> <li> Yes, but he will only be able to work for one year at the library until his mother leaves Canada.</li> </ul> </li> </ol>","tags":["ICL830","Notes","Quizzes"]},{"location":"immigration/830/syllabus/","title":"ICL 830 \u2013 Temporary Entry <sup>1</sup>","text":"","tags":["ICL830","Syllabus"]},{"location":"immigration/830/syllabus/#required-textbooks","title":"Required Textbooks","text":"<ul> <li>Desloges &amp; Sawicki, Canadian Immigration and Refugee Law, A Practitioner\u2019s Handbook, 4th ed (Emond 2023)</li> <li>Douglas Cochran, Interviewing Skills for Legal Professionals, 3rd ed (Emond, 2022)</li> <li>Green et al, Temporary Entry into the Canadian Labour Market (Emond 2021)</li> </ul>","tags":["ICL830","Syllabus"]},{"location":"immigration/830/syllabus/#assessment-weighting","title":"Assessment Weighting","text":"Assessment Weight Engagement/ Skills Reflection Pass/Fail Assignment 1: Interview Preparations and Recording 20% Assignment 2: Work Permit 20% Assignment 3: LMIA Submission Letter/Memorandum (Group project) 20% Final Quiz (Modules 1 to 6, closed-book, proctored) 40%","tags":["ICL830","Syllabus"]},{"location":"immigration/830/syllabus/#engagement","title":"Engagement","text":"<p>Check out Skills Relection of ICL820.

Those notes, when read together with the decision letter and NOC 6235, also demonstrate why the officer refused the application.  The lead statement for the occupation category the applicant relied on \u2013 Financial Sales Representative \u2013 indicates that, as the title suggests, individuals in this role \u201csell basic deposit, investment and loan products and services to individuals and businesses.\u201d  The letters from Scotiabank, however, do not say that the applicant sells any such thing to anyone.  Instead, as the respondent points out, the letters suggest that the applicant provided backroom support to others at the bank who did sell such things.  Under paragraph 87.1(2)(b) of the IRPR, the applicant had to \u201cperform the actions described in the lead statement for the occupation\u201d she cited in her application to qualify.

The answer to the question of whether the Applicant performed a substantial number of the main duties of a cook set out in the NOC is \u201cvery much a discretionary judgment call. Parliament has said that visa officers are to make that discretionary call and, as the jurisprudence makes clear, the Court cannot countermand a decision unless it falls outside of the range posited in paragraph 47 of Dunsmuir\u201d (Hosseini v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 766 at para 54). Deference must be afforded to the assessment of an Applicant\u2019s job experience and its comparison to the NOC job description (Qin v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 147 at para 16, aff\u2019d 2013 FCA 263 at para 25).</li> <li>[24] If the Applicant\u2019s evidence, notably his employer\u2019s letter, had provided details about how the Applicant prepares food items from scratch, it likely would not have been open to the Immigration Officer to conclude that he prepares simple food items by assembling pre-made items. The onus was on the Applicant to present sufficient evidence that his application met the requirements of the NOC (Saatchi v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 FC 1037 at para 30; Morgan v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 897 at para 15) and the Immigration Officer reasonably concluded that he had not met that burden.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Relevant Websites <ul> <li>Language Skills<ul> <li>Canada, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, \u201cFederal skilled workers selection criteria: Official language proficiency\u201d (11 August 2023), online.<ul> <li>See also language requirements for other programs, accessible through: Canada, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, \u201cModernized functional guidance for language requirements\u201d (7 May 2013), online.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Canada, Centre for Canadian Language Benchmarks, Canadian Language Benchmarks: English as a Second Language for Adults, (Ottawa: Citizenship and Immigration Canada, 2012), online (pdf).</li> <li>Canada, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, \u201cDesignated language-testing organizations\u201d (30 January 2024), online.</li> <li>Canada, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, \u201cPublic policy concerning economic class permanent residence applicants and Express Entry candidates whose language proficiency cannot be tested in all four language skill areas due to a physical or mental disability\u201d (13 January 2015), online.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Educational Credentials Assessment<ul> <li>Canada, Immigration and Citizenship, \u201cEducational credential assessment (ECA) for Express Entry: What it is\u201d and subsequent pages (30 April 2024), online.</li> <li>Canada, Immigration and Citizenship, \u201cEducational credential assessment (ECA) for Express Entry: How to get one for express entry\u201d (26 July 2024), online.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Medical Examinations<ul> <li>Canada, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, \u201cMedical Requirements\u201d (19 September 2014), online.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Police Certificates<ul> <li>Canada, Immigration and Citizenship, \u201cAbout police certificates\u201d (12 August 2024), online.</li> <li>Canada, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, \u201cApplications for permanent residence programs subject to the Express Entry completeness check\u201d (29 September 2023), online.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Biometrics<ul> <li>Canada, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, \u201cBiometrics collection and screening\u201d (20 January 2023), online.</li> </ul> </li> <li>National Occupational Classification<ul> <li>Canada, National Occupational Classification, \u201cChanges to the National Occupational Classification\u201d (2 June 2023), online.

The RIAS does not indicate, however, that an officer\u2019s assessment of economic establishment must be conducted in the same manner as the province\u2019s or territory\u2019s approach. Rather, it leaves open that officers at the federal level are entitled to their own interpretations on a file, and may consider additional or altogether different factors when determining whether to substitute an evaluation pursuant to IRPR 87(3), as was done here: Debnath, above at para 15. While a provincial or territorial nomination decision is owed deference on the government\u2019s assessment of applicable criteria, it is not binding on federal officers: Chaudhry v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 1072 [Chaudhry] at para 28; Sran v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 791 [Sran] at para 13. Officers must conduct their own analysis objectively, however, to achieve a consistent process [i.e. fair], taking into account their decision should not displace the underlying intent of the applicable program: Roohi v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 FC 1408  at para 31.

In many cases, that would be an advisable step in order to learn more details about an officer\u2019s concerns.</li> <li>The applicant will be given an opportunity to provide additional information on the medical condition and social services identified, as well the chance to provide an individualized mitigation plan to ensure no excessive demand will be imposed on Canadian social services, along with a \u201cDeclaration of Ability and Intent\u201d form and any supporting evidence.</li> <li>In such cases, in the applicant\u2019s reply they may also request an exemption from inadmissibility on humanitarian and compassionate grounds under IRPA, s 25.</li> <li>Unlike for medical certificates, the requirements for obtaining police certificates is not set out expressly in the legislation. Rather it is found in IRCC\u2019s online operational instructions.</li> <li>The instructions also state that in exceptional circumstances, an officer may accept both proof of having requested a police certificate for some countries and an explanation of how they have made their best efforts to follow up and procure the document.</li> <li>All applicants for permanent resident visas who are 14 years or older or 79 years and younger must provide biometric information (see IRPR 12.2(1)(a) and (b)).</li> </ul> NOC 2021 <ul> <li>The NOC is reviewed and reissued every 5 years. The latest revision (NOC 2021) was introduced in November 2022 and was substantial.</li> <li>\u201cTEER Category 0, 1, 2, or 3\u201d refer to high-skilled occupations.</li> <li>Applications for permanent residence will need to show that their experience or job offer meets the kinds of requirements we have referenced, concerning the Federal Skilled Worker Class, Canadian Experience Class, and the Federal Skilled Trades Program. To do so, applicants will typically need to obtain a letter from their current, former, or future employer describing their tasks and responsibilities in their job.</li> <li>Potla v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2020 FC 646.<ul> <li>[29]  On the other hand, as Justice Gleeson also explained, if a decision maker has concerns relating to the credibility of information submitted in support of an application or to the accuracy or genuineness of that information, procedural fairness will often require that the applicant be given an opportunity to address those concerns before a decision is made: see Lazar at para 21.</li> <li>[31]  In the present case, the officer did not have any concerns about the credibility, accuracy or genuineness of the information or supporting documents the applicant submitted with her application.  To be precise, there is no suggestion that the officer had any doubt that the applicant had been employed as an Analyst with Scotiabank during the time period indicated in her application.  Rather, the officer was not satisfied that this employment, as described in the documents the applicant submitted in support of her application, was sufficient to satisfy the legal requirements for obtaining permanent residence under the CEC program. Procedural fairness did not require the officer to alert the applicant to this deficiency in her application before refusing it.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Kumar v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 367.<ul> <li>[20]  While I agree that there may be an overlap between the duties of food preparer and cook, the real question for the visa officer is to determine the pith and substance of the work performed by the Applicant (Rodrigues v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2009 FC 111 at para 10). The answer to the question of whether the Applicant performed a substantial number of the main duties of a cook set out in the NOC is \u201cvery much a discretionary judgment call. Parliament has said that visa officers are to make that discretionary call and, as the jurisprudence makes clear, the Court cannot countermand a decision unless it falls outside of the range posited in paragraph 47 of Dunsmuir\u201d (Hosseini v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 766 at para 54). Deference must be afforded to the assessment of an Applicant\u2019s job experience and its comparison to the NOC job description (Qin v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 147 at para 16, aff\u2019d 2013 FCA 263 at para 25).</li> </ul> </li> </ul>","tags":["ICL840","Notes","Quizzes"]},{"location":"immigration/840/ICL840week2/#quizzes","title":"Quizzes","text":"Knowledge Check 2.1: Language and Educational Credentials <ol> <li> <p>The Governor in Council has the authority to establish minimum language proficiency thresholds under s 74(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False <p>Under s 74(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship is required to establish minimum official language proficiency thresholds for the Federal Skilled Worker class, the Federal Skilled Trades class, and the Canadian Experience Class.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The standard for assessing language proficiency as part of applications within the economic class is called:</p> <ul> <li> Canadian Language Benchmarks</li> <li> Test of English as a Foreign Language</li> <li> International English Language Testing System</li> <li> Canadian Academic English Language Assessment</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>According to the Bano v.

An officer\u2019s assessment in that regard is entitled to a high degree of deference (Pathirannahelage v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 811 at para 25 (\u201cPathirannahelage\u201d)).</li> <li>[30] ... s 82 of the IRPR requires that an employer has offered arranged employment to the applicant, which is defined as an offer of employment \u201cfor continuous full-time work in Canada having a duration of at least one year after the date on which a permanent resident visa is issued\u201d</li> </ul> </li> <li>Singh v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 132.<ul> <li>[8] The Officer\u2019s failure to refer to this evidence or to explain why it was insufficient to overcome the initial concern about Mr.  Singh\u2019s work experience renders the decision unreasonable.</li> <li>[10] The Officer\u2019s lingering concern about an overlap between Mr. Singh\u2019s accounting studies and his employment was also misplaced.  If the Officer had taken care to examine the relevant records, he could only have concluded that Mr. Singh\u2019s accreditation studies required corresponding internship employment.  The fact that he was studying and working at the same time was not suspicious \u2013 it was expected.</li> <li>[12] The rejection of Mr. Singh\u2019s permanent residency application appears to have been based on the Officer\u2019s after-the-fact assessment of the merits of Mr. Singh\u2019s previous temporary visa applications.  Whether or not those earlier visa applications ought to have been accepted was not before the Officer.  The Officer\u2019s failure to engage with the evidence presented in support of the application before him is fatal to the decision and the decision is, accordingly, set aside.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> EE: Who Can Apply? <ul> <li>First, find your NOC.</li> <li>Canadian skilled work experience (CEC)<ul> <li>Your skilled work experience must:<ul> <li> be in (TEER) 0, 1, 2, or 3<sup>2</sup></li> <li> be in Canada while authorized to work under temporary resident status</li> <li> perform actions in the lead statement and most of the main duties</li> <li> be paid work</li> <li> at least 1 year of work or 1,560 hours total (30 hours per week) in the 3 years before you apply<sup>3</sup></li> </ul> </li> <li> Language ability: meet CLB 5 for TEER 2 or 3, CLB 7 for TEER 0 or 1.</li> <li> no education requirement</li> <li> You must be admissible to Canada.</li> <li> You must plan to live outside the province of Quebec.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Federal Skilled Worker (FSW)<ul> <li>Your skilled work experience must:<ul> <li> be in (TEER) 0, 1, 2, or 3</li> <li> have the same NOC as the job you want to use for your immigration application (called your primary occupation).

These requirements are the subject of Gugliotti v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 71.<ul> <li>[34] I agree with the Applicant that the regulations do not specify the manner of proof of the required financial information to be filed. While the regulations do set out the requirement to provide proof of settlement funds, they do not specify what is, or is not accepted as proof; they are silent as to the means by which an applicant may satisfy the obligation to demonstrate sufficient establishment funds. All parties are in agreement to this point as is the Court.</li> <li>[36] It is also trite to observe that if a Visa Officer has concerns with the reliability of documents, and reasonably requests addition information to weigh or assess the evidence filed, an Applicant may either provide that information or be prepared to see his or her application denied. There is no suggestion that a Visa Officer must obtain regulatory approval before reasonably asking for further and better verification; the authority to demand more, assuming it is reasonably exercised, flows directly from, and in my view is inextricably bound up with, the Officers\u2019 duty to weigh and assess the evidence before them.</li> <li>[39] I should note that no one suggested requiring this extra level of verification is in any way unreasonable; an applicant merely need his or her financial institution to send an official letter in relation to its records which in my respectful view is quite reasonable. It is no different than asking a person who submits a photocopy of a property deed to provide a notarial copy where reasonable, or asking a person who submits a photocopy of a letter to provide the original where reasonable. And it makes no difference, in my view, if requirements for verification are made known before or after the material is submitted, although common sense suggests it is preferable for all concerned that applicants know in advance, as was the case here.</li> </ul> </li> <li>to exempt an applicant from the need to prove they have adequate settlement funds, the arranged employment must be one of three kinds:<ul> <li>Under paragraph 82(2)(a) of the IRPR, LMIA-based or exempted job offer.</li> <li>TEER 0, 1, 2 or 3.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Summary.

Rather, the provision is a permissive one and grants the right to Immigration Officers (and not to applicants) to conduct a substitute evaluation in the prescribed circumstances.</li> <li>this statement leaves it unclear as to whether an officer is required to consider substituted evaluation if requested by the applicant.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> Procedural Fairness Letters <ul> <li>one aspect of procedural fairness is that an applicant must be made aware of the case they have to meet: see Akhtar v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 123 at para 19; Canadian Pacific Railway Company v Canada (Attorney General), 2018 FCA 69 at para 56.<ul> <li>[19] Justice Rennie, writing for the Federal Court of Appeal in CP, made it clear that an applicant must be aware of the case to meet in order to have a fair process.  There, the Federal Court of Appeal clarified that there is an inherent \u201cawkwardness\u201d to \u201cshoehorn\u201d the question of procedural fairness into a standard of review analysis.  Evaluating whether a decision-maker provided a procedurally fair process requires the reviewing court to ask \u201cwhether the procedure was fair having regard to all of the circumstances\u201d and \u201cwith a sharp focus on the nature of the substantive rights involved and the consequences for an individual, whether a fair and just process was followed\u201d (CP at paras 54\u201355).  Ultimately, the reviewing court must first determinate whether the applicant knew the case to meet, and second, whether he or she had a full and fair chance to respond (CP at para 56).</li> <li>[56] No matter how much deference is accorded administrative tribunals in the exercise of their discretion to make procedural choices, the ultimate question remains whether the applicant knew the case to meet and had a full and fair chance to respond. It would be problematic if an a priori decision as to whether the standard of review is correctness or reasonableness generated a different answer to what is a singular question that is fundamental to the concept of justice: was the party given a right to be heard and the opportunity to know the case against them? Procedural fairness is not sacrificed on the altar of deference.</li> </ul> </li> <li>This is also reflected in Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada\u2019s operational instructions on procedural fairness. It is worthwhile to take note of how these instructions explain this principle:<ul> <li>To ensure that the applicant has a meaningful opportunity to participate, decision-makers must give sufficient notice about any process or interview that could result in a decision on their application and must give the applicant a reasonable opportunity to bring evidence or make arguments supporting their application. Decision-makers should tell applicants which documents may be required in order to address concerns. Sufficient information should be included on interview invitation letters to allow applicants to prepare. If any additional concerns arise from an interview, decision-makers should provide the applicant with an opportunity to address those concerns either at the interview or subsequent to the interview, through a procedural fairness letter.</li> <li>The right to be heard requires that an applicant be given a meaningful opportunity to take part in the process. This requirement also applies in regard to information received from third parties, including IRCC partners. While this does not mean that the decision-maker must provide the physical documents consulted during the decision-making process (El Maghraoui v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 883), there is a requirement that the essence of the decision-maker\u2019s concerns be communicated to the applicant (Krishnamoorthy v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2011 FC 1342) and that the applicant is advised of the specific provisions of the Act at issue. What is important is that the decision-maker\u2019s concerns are adequately communicated to the applicant, who must then be given a reasonable opportunity to respond.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The purpose of procedural fairness letters is described in Bui v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 440:<ul> <li>[29] An officer may put concerns to an applicant by way of a procedural fairness letter. Said letter must contain enough detail to enable the applicant to know the case to meet, meaning that the applicant is provided with a reasonable understanding of why the officer is inclined to deny the application (Bayramov v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 256 at para 15; Ezemenari v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 619 at para 11). In other words, an applicant should not be \u201ckept in the dark\u201d about the information upon which an officer may render a decision (Chawla v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 434 at para 19). (Emphasis added.)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Procedural fairness letters are less common in applications for permanent residence under the Economic Class, as compared to other types of applications.</li> <li>Kapoor v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 1002<ul> <li>On judicial review, the decision was challenged in part on the basis that the visa officer did not properly discuss all the evidence submitted.</li> <li>[19] \u2026 A visa officer does not need to mention every piece of evidence in his or her reasons for a decision; and, moreover, it is assumed that an officer weighed and considered all of the evidence before him or her, unless the contrary is shown.</li> <li>The Kapoor decision, therefore, shows that a failure to respond effectively to a procedural fairness letter may lead to a refusal of an application.</li> <li>A sample of PFL.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>","tags":["ICL840","Notes","Quizzes"]},{"location":"immigration/840/ICL840week4/#quizzes","title":"Quizzes","text":"Knowledge Check 4.1: Federal Skilled Worker Class Regulations <ol> <li> <p>Joan has been invited to apply for permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Worker Class.

Which of the following statements best encapsulates the principal holding in that case?</p> <ul> <li> While a visa officer may ask for additional verification of financial statements, this additional request must be authorized by a ministerial instruction.</li> <li> The immigration officer improperly fettered her discretion by imposing a requirement (a verification letter from a financial institution) that is not found in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.</li> <li> It is reasonable to base a decision on a policy requiring additional verification by a financial institution of an applicant's available funds. No specific regulatory authorization of this requirement is necessary.</li> <li> Settlement funds may not include amounts invested in mutual funds.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Paolo wants to come to Canada as a permanent resident to live in Trois-Rivi\u00e8res. He asks you if he can apply to do so under the Federal Skilled Worker Class. What do you answer?</p> <ul> <li> Yes</li> <li> No <p>No. It is a requirement of the Federal Skilled Worker Class that you do not intend to reside in Quebec.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>True or false: The Court in Gugliotti v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 71, held that when a visa officer is requesting more supporting documents from the Applicant, they must obtain regulatory approval before asking for further and better verification.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Jean is a citizen of France. He has been invited to apply for permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Worker Class. He is married to Saul, a citizen of the United Kingdom. Jean has a biological daughter (Audrey, 8 years old) from a previous marriage. Saul has a biological son (Mack, aged 12) also from a previous marriage.</p> <p>Saul's ex-wife, Anita, is a Canadian citizen and lives in Montreal, although Jean and Saul are planning to live in Edmonton. Anita is now married to Herbert, also a Canadian citizen. Anita and Herbert have no children together, but Herbert has a 28-year-old biological daughter, Barbara, from a previous marriage. Barbara is a Canadian citizen, but she lives and works in New York City with her boyfriend; they are both highly successful lawyers.</p> <p>Jean can provide a letter showing that he has $23,921 in unencumbered funds. Does he have sufficient settlement funds for his application to be accepted?</p> <ul> <li> Yes</li> <li> No <p>Answer: No. Since there is no mention of arranged employment, Jean must show he has 1/2 the minimum necessary income necessary to support his family members (IRPR, s 76(1)(b)(i)). His family members include himself and his spouse and their dependent children (IRPR, s 1(3)). Here that means that he must show he has 1/2 the minimum necessary income to support 4 people (himself, Saul, and their two biological children). According to the table provided by IRCC, that means he needs $27,297 in settlement funds (as of 28 May 2024). This answer may change in subsequent years, since the low-income cut-offs are recalculated each year by Statistics Canada.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Marco has been working in Guelph, Ontario for 2 years as a barber.

These are the British Columbia Provincial Nominee Program, the Quebec Skilled Worker program, and the Atlantic Immigration Program.</li> <li>For instance, from 2019 to 2024, the government piloted a specific immigration stream aimed at economic development in rural areas and the Canadian north, the 'Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot'.</li> </ul> Shared Jurisdiction <ul> <li>The Constitutional and Legislative Basis<ul> <li>subsection 91(25) of the Constitution Act, 1867 provides the federal government with power to pass laws with respect to \u201cnaturalization and aliens.\u201d</li> <li>section 95 of the Constitution Act, 1867 \u2013 one part of Canada\u2019s constitution \u2013 provides authority to both the federal Parliament\u202fand\u202fthe provinces to makes laws governing immigration, although\u202ffederal laws are to prevail in case of conflict.</li> </ul> </li> <li>For instance, based on the success of the Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot Program, in 2024 IRCC launched two subsequent pilots - the Rural Community Immigration pilot and the Francophone Community Immigration Pilot.</li> <li>IRPA s 8:<ul> <li>Subsection 8(1) establishes the authority to enter into agreements with the provinces or territories.</li> <li>Subsection 8(2) then states that the IRPA and its regulations respecting the selection and sponsorship of, and the acquisition of status by, foreign nationals must be consistent with those agreements.</li> <li>However, subsection 8(3) states that federal-provincial agreements cannot affect the IRPA\u2019s provisions concerning inadmissibility.</li> </ul> </li> <li>IRPA s 9: Subsection 9(1) then further specifies that when a federal-provincial agreement gives sole responsibility to a province or territory for selecting foreign nationals who intend to reside in that province as permanent residents, then<ul> <li>the province\u2019s selection of the foreign national for permanent residence shall be determinative, unless the foreign national is inadmissible or unless the agreement provides otherwise;</li> <li>the province\u2019s decision not to select the foreign national shall be determinative unless the agreement provides otherwise;</li> <li>the foreign national shall not be granted permanent resident status contrary to any provincial law governing the number of new permanent residents who may settle in the province; and</li> <li>conditions imposed in accordance with the law of the province have the same force and effect as if they were made under the IRPA. <p>As we shall see, however, the IRPR, does make it so that the province\u2019s decision is not entirely determinative.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li>IRPA s 10:<ul> <li>Finally, section 10 sets out a mandate for the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship to consult with the provinces.</li> <li>Subsection 10(1) states the Minister may consult with provinces on immigration and refugee protection programs to facilitate cooperation.</li> <li>Subsection 10(2) states that the Minister must consult with the provinces with respect to the number of foreign nationals in each class (refugee, economic, and family) who will become permanent residents each year, their distribution in Canada, and integration measures.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Provincial Nominee Class Regulations <ul> <li>The federal government has entered into agreements over immigration with every province and territory other than Nunavut.</li> <li>The regulations for the Provincial Nominee Class are set out in section 87 in the IRPR. Section 87 can be understood as comprising three parts:<ul> <li>The three basic requirements for inclusion in the Provincial Nominee Class.</li> <li>A power of substituted evaluation.</li> <li>Certain exclusions for persons whose admission would be based on the provision of capital or participation in \u201can immigration-linked investment scheme.\u201d</li> </ul> </li> <li>Basic Requirements<ul> <li>Subsection 87(1) establishes the Provincial Nominee Class as a class of persons who may become permanent residents on the basis of their ability to become economically established in Canada.</li> <li>Subsection 87(2) then sets out that a foreign national is a member of the Provincial Nominee Class if:<ul> <li>they are named in a nomination certificate issued by a province or territory under an agreement with the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, and</li> <li>they intend to reside in the province or territory that has nominated them.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>If a foreign national \u2013 when being examined either at a port of entry or in Canada \u2013 indicates they never intended, or no longer intend, to reside in the nominating province or territory, they may be denied permanent resident status. In such cases, they may also face a determination that they are inadmissible under section 41 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), which sets out the ground of inadmissibility for non-compliance.</li> <li>The provincial or territorial nomination is generally supposed to satisfy the requirement of likely economic establishment.</li> <li>Substituted Evaluation in the PNC: Subsections 87(3) and (4) of the IRPR provide immigration officers with the discretion to substitute their evaluation, with the concurrence of a second officer, of whether or not a nominee is likely to become economically established in Canada.</li> <li>The operational instructions provide extensive guidance to officers on how to evaluate the ability of a provincial nominee to become economically established when considering the exercise of their power of substituted evaluation under subsections 87(3) and (4) pf the IRPR.</li> <li>Sarfraz v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 1578.<ul> <li>In that decision, an officer exercised their substituted evaluation power to refuse an application made under the Saskatchewan Immigration Nominee Program because of concerns regarding the applicant\u2019s language ability.</li> <li>Justice Fuhrer wrote at para 22: the substituted evaluation power ... leaves open that officers at the federal level are entitled to their own interpretation on a file, and may consider additional or altogether different factors [than the nominating province or territory] when determining whether to substitute an evaluation pursuant to IRPR 87(3) \u2026 While a provincial or territorial nomination decision is owed deference on the government\u2019s assessment of the applicable criteria, it is not binding on federal officers.</li> <li>Justice Fuhrer found the officer erred in three ways:<ul> <li>By relying on the Employment and Social Development Canada Job Bank in evaluating whether the applicant could become economically established in Canada, to the exclusion of the factors taken into account by the nominating province.</li> <li>Failing to hold a follow-up discussion with the provincial authorities, even though they requested one.</li> <li>Failing to consider whether the applicant\u2019s spouse could contribute to the family\u2019s economic establishment.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Exclusions: Subsections 87(5) to (11) of the IRPR govern certain exclusions from the Provincial Nominee Class.</li> </ul> Applications under the Provincial Nominee Class <ul> <li>There are two streams. Applications for the Provincial Nominee Class may be made through the Express Entry system or through the non-express entry application process, where applications are submitted via the permanent residence portal.</li> <li>If an applicant does not apply through Express Entry, because they have been nominated by a province in a program that is not Express Entry eligible, they apply through a new Permanent residence online application portal for clients and a Permanent Residence Portal for representatives to submit applications with their clients.</li> <li>Once an applicant has received an invitation and submitted their application electronically through the Express Entry system, their application will be assessed for:<ul> <li>Whether they meet the requirements under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, or IRPR, for the provincial nominee class;</li> <li>Whether they are inadmissible;</li> <li>Whether they meet the program requirements for either the Federal Skilled Worker Class, the Federal Skilled Trades Class, or the Canadian Experience Class;</li> <li>Whether they meet the requirements of section 11.2 (met at ITA and Submission) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).</li> </ul> </li> </ul> The Atlantic Immigration Program (AIP) <ul> <li>IRCC started accepting permanent residence applications under the Atlantic Immigration Program (AIP) on March 6, 2022.</li> <li>three programs created through Ministerial Instructions under section 14.1 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act in 2017:<ul> <li>The Atlantic Canada Intermediate Skilled Worker Class</li> <li>The Atlantic Canada Highly Skilled Worker Class</li> <li>The Atlantic Canada International Graduate Class</li> </ul> </li> <li>Instructions issued under section 14.1 (3) of the IRPA cap the number of applications accepted under the program each year at 2,750, distributed unequally among the Atlantic provinces: 646 for New Brunswick; 792 for Nova Scotia; 442 for Newfoundland and Labrador; and 120 for Prince Edward Island.</li> <li>Since March 6 2022, the three programs are now part of the Regulations under part 6 - economic immigration under section 87.3 of the IRPR.</li> <li>The \"three streams\" concept is gone, and now the key requirement for candidates is to have sufficient skilled work experience (NOC TEERs 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4), which is not required when the candidate has recently studied and graduated as an international student at a recognized post-secondary institution.</li> <li>Now as a program, the number of permanent residents accepted through AIP is established yearly with the immigration levels reporting before Parliament, as with all of the other Federal Immigration programs.</li> <li>The AIP is an employer-focused program.  Employers must apply to the province of location to be designated as participants, and once designated, then bring each job opportunity to the province to be endorsed (so, no LMIA).  Once the job opportunity is endorsed, then the employer can find an acceptable candidate, offer them the job, and they can apply to IRCC for permanent residence.</li> <li>To be designated as a participant, the employer must apply to the province establishing that they:<ul> <li>Have a business operating in good standing</li> <li>Provide information on labour needs</li> <li>Commit to working with a service provider organization on settlement and retention</li> </ul> </li> <li>Then to go to the next step and have a position endorsed, the employer must:<ul> <li>Demonstrate that efforts to hire locally have been unsuccessful</li> <li>Recruit a foreign worker</li> <li>Provide a valid, full-time, non-seasonal job offer co-signed by the foreign worker</li> <li>Provide an individualized settlement plan co-signed by the foreign worker</li> <li>Complete mandatory onboarding training and, if required, intercultural competency training</li> </ul> </li> <li>Some of these requirements are set out in IRPR 87.3, some in the IRCC Program Delivery Instructions, some in the provinces\u2019 immigration agreements with the federal government, and some are found in the guides on the provincial governments\u2019 websites.</li> <li>If a foreign national is endorsed by the province (in our case, Nova Scotia), they will receive a Certificate of Endorsement from the province and an endorsement number. They must then apply to IRCC for permanent residence before the expiry date of the endorsement. Candidates may also apply for a temporary work permit so that they can work while their application for permanent residence is being processed.</li> <li>When applying for permanent residence from IRCC, additional requirements are set out in the regulations under 87.3.<ul> <li>Work experience: In the last 5 years, candidates must have at least one year (1560 hours) of work experience in a NOC TEER category 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4<ul> <li>International graduates are exempt from the work experience requirement if they completed a post-secondary program in Atlantic Canada of at least two years and resided in the Province for at least 16 months in the two years before graduating.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Education requirement: Candidates with a job offer in NOC TEER category 0 or 1 must demonstrate completion of a post secondary credential of at least one year and candidates with a job offer in NOC TEER category 2, 3, 4 must demonstrate completion of high school.</li> <li>Language requirement: Candidates must provide language test results demonstrating a minimum CLB 5 for positions in TEER category 0, 1, 2 or 3 and CLB 4 for TEER category 4.</li> <li>Settlement funds: Candidates must demonstrate they have funding to support themselves when they initially arrive in Canada. The AIP requires 12.5% of the LICO. This requirement does not apply if candidates are already living and working in Canada with a valid work permit.</li> <li>Finally, applicants must have an offer of employment from a designated employer for a full-time, non-seasonal position.<ul> <li>That is for at least one year after the time the applicant will become a permanent resident for occupations that are in NOC TEER category 0, 1, 2 or 3 and permanent (no end date) for NOC TEER category 4.</li> <li>That is at the same skill level or higher than the work experience that qualified you for the job.</li> <li>The job offer cannot be from a company where the applicant or their spouse is a majority owner.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> AIP - Nova Scotia <ul> <li>To apply for PR under the Atlantic Program, a foreign national must have received an offer of employment meeting criteria of S. 87.3 (6)(c):<ul> <li>(c) it must be made by the employer named in the endorsement certificate, and that employer must not be referred to in any of subparagraphs 200(3)(h)(i) to (iii) or more than 50% owned or controlled, directly or indirectly, by the foreign national or their spouse or common-law partner;</li> </ul> </li> <li>Subparagraphs 200(3)(h)(i) to (iii) refer employers who have failed to comply with the rules of the work permit regime. That is, it covers employers who have failed to provide wages and working conditions in conformity with job offers that were the basis of previous work permits or having failed to pay an administrative monetary penalty.</li> <li>Designated Employers:<ul> <li>has been in continuous, active operation for two years in the Atlantic region or has approved corporate plans to relocate to Nova Scotia;</li> <li>have been under the same management for at least the 2 years prior to designation</li> <li>agrees to complete an intercultural competency assessment and complete any required training, with an approved immigrant settlement service organization</li> <li>agrees to settlement supports, and services</li> <li>report to the province for up to 3 years from the start of their employment</li> </ul> </li> <li>to receive an endorsement an employer must establish:<ul> <li>That the job offer is genuine, and</li> <li>That they have agreed to a settlement plan with the prospective employee based on a pre-endorsement needs assessment.</li> </ul> </li> <li>To apply for an endorsement in Nova Scotia, an applicant and the employer must fill out the Endorsement Application through Nova Scotia\u2019s online system. The complete list can be found in the Endorsement Application Guidelines.</li> </ul> British Columbia Provincial Nominee Program <ul> <li>The pieces of BCPNP framework include:<ul> <li>The Canada-British Columbia Immigration Agreement from 2021,</li> <li>The Provincial Immigration Programs Act (BCPIPA),</li> <li>The Provincial Immigration Programs Regulation (BCPIPR), and</li> <li>The Program Guide, Technical Guide and Post-Nomination Guide for the BC PNP.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Section 4 of Annex A provides the most detailed list of requirements for the BC PNP:<ul> <li>It goes on to state that BC will accordingly establish \u201cobjective and transparent criteria\u201d for nomination that will \"be designed to assess the ability of the applicant to become economically established in British Columbia and to demonstrate the economic benefit to the province \u201d (see section 4.3).</li> <li>The kinds of factors that may be used to determine likelihood of economic establishment are also set out in section 4.5: \u201ccurrent job or job offer, language ability, work experience, education and training, and business ownership skills and past experience.\u201d</li> <li>Section 4.6 states that non-economic factors may only be used to determine \u201cthe applicant's ability to adapt, likelihood to reside and/or settle in the nominating province.\u201d</li> <li>CLB 4 for NOC C, D (NOC 4, 5)</li> </ul> </li> <li>the government of British Columbia has also established its own system for issuing invitations to apply based on a points system administered through its online registration system.</li> <li>BCPIPA<ul> <li>Subsection 2(1) of the BCPIPA provides the Minister of Jobs, Economic Development and Competitiveness with the power to designate a Director of Provincial Immigration Programs, as head of the BC PNP</li> <li>Subsection 3(2) of the BCPIPA gives the director the power to invite applications for a class of approvals specified. This power provides the mandate for BC\u2019s own invitation-to-apply system, based on points allocated when applicants register online.</li> <li>subsection 3(3) of the BCPIPA: Refusal to Accept for Processing<ul> <li>if an invitation to apply has been issued that does not apply to an applicant;</li> <li>if the applicant has retained an unauthorized representative;</li> <li>if the applicant has previously had an approval cancelled; or</li> <li>if a prescribed requirement has not been met.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The \u201cprescribed requirements\u201d are set out in section 5 of the BCPIPR, for example, misrepresentation within 2 years.</li> <li>subsection 4(1) of the BCPIPA states that the director may approve or decline an application (i.e., an application that the director has not refused to accept) after taking into account prescribed matters, which are found in section 6 of the BCPIPR:<ul> <li>whether the applicant\u2019s entry will be of benefit to the economic development of British Columbia;</li> <li>the applicant\u2019s ability and intention to permanently settle and become economically established in British Columbia;</li> <li>the applicant\u2019s language skills;</li> <li>whether the applicant\u2019s entry will adversely affect the settlement of a labour dispute or the employment of a person involved in a labour dispute, or\u202femployment or training opportunities for British Columbians;</li> <li>whether the applicant has entered into or intends to enter into an immigration-linked investment scheme;</li> <li>whether the information provided in relation to the application is accurate, complete and reliable;</li> <li>with respect to an application for a business approval, whether the applicant will provide active and ongoing management of the eligible business from within British Columbia.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Subsection 4(2) of the BCPIPA allows the director to make an approval of a nominee subject to conditions considered \u201cnecessary and advisable\u201d. Section 5 of the BCPIPA imposes an obligation on \u201can approved person\u201d (i.e., a nominee) to comply with any such conditions and also to advise the director of any material change in their circumstances. Failure to report a material change or failure to comply with a condition may lead to the cancellation of an approval, under subsection 6(1) of the BCPIPA.</li> <li>Approvals can also be cancelled if the director is satisfied that the nominee provided false or misleading information in their application.</li> <li>Section 7 of the BCPIPA states that if the director has declined an application for a nomination, the applicant may request a review of that decision within 30 days if the applicant is in Canada or within 60 days if they are outside Canada.<ul> <li>The Program Guide (at page 74) states the following regarding reviews: A review is not a chance to submit new evidence or re-argue the evidence submitted in your application. The applicant is responsible for establishing that the process was unfair or that the decision was unreasonable in relation to the evidence and program criteria.</li> </ul> </li> <li>There are currently five streams in the BC PNP Skills Immigration program, four of which can be applied for through Express Entry.<ul> <li>Skilled worker,</li> <li>Healthcare professional,</li> <li>International graduate,</li> <li>International post-graduate, and</li> <li>Entry-level and semi-skilled (no EE available).</li> </ul> </li> <li>The International Graduate and International Post-Graduate streams are currently closed. In March 2024, BC announced that in early 2025 these streams will be replaced by three new streams: Bachelor's stream, Master's stream, and Doctorate stream.</li> <li>General Requirements:<ul> <li>have a qualifying job offer. For skilled workers, a job offer must be for an occupation classified as TEER Category 0, 1, 2 or 3 under the NOC matrix.</li> <li>The requirements for employers to be \u201celigible\u201d are set out in pages 50 to 54 of the Program Guide.They include, for example and among others, the requirements:<ul> <li>to be \u201cin good standing\u201d in BC (e.g., to be incorporated);</li> <li>to have a certain number of full-time, indeterminate employees (at least 5, if located in the Greater Vancouver area or at least 3 if elsewhere in BC); and</li> <li>to show that genuine efforts were made to recruit from the local labour market before extending a job offer to the applicant.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The Program Guide contains detailed information on how to meet these requirements in Part 4: Employer Requirements. Much of the necessary information to verify these requirements are collected through the BC PNP Job Offer Form, but supporting documents will be required as well.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Qualified Employment:<ul> <li>Qualification may be assessed referring to the NOC matrix, WorkBC (a provincial agency that provides labour market information), or industry standards.</li> <li>The wage offered must be competitive with B.C. wage rates for the occupation and the employment must provide an economic benefit to the province.</li> <li>The employment offered must not adversely affect the settlement of a labour dispute.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Language Proficiency:<ul> <li>CLB 4 for NOC 2, 3, 4 or 5</li> <li>Applicants are not required to submit language test results if position the position they have accepted is classified as TEER category 0 or 1</li> <li>Copies of language test results must be provided at the time of application.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Minimum Income Requirements:<ul> <li>In addition, the BC PNP imposes minimum income requirements, as opposed to the requirement of settlement funds imposed (as we have seen) under certain federal economic classes.</li> <li>A table showing the minimum income required, by location and number of dependents, is found at page 22 of the Program Guide.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Program Integrity Requirements:<ul> <li>Applicants will not be nominated if they are prohibited from entering Canada, are in Canada but out of status, are working in Canada without authorization, have an unresolved refugee protection claim, or are under a removal order.</li> <li>For the purposes of assessing work experience in Canada, the BC PNP will only consider authorized work experience.</li> <li>In the five years preceding the application, and throughout the BC PNP application process, the applicant and their spouse or common-law partner must not have held a combined ownership/equity stake of more than 10 per cent in the BC company that has offered the applicant employment.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Specific Requirements: Skilled Worker Stream<ul> <li>an offer of employment must be classified as TEER category 0, 1, 2, or 3 under the NOC matrix.</li> <li>The applicant must also have a \u201cminimum two years of directly related full-time (or full-time equivalent) work experience in the skilled occupation that has been offered to you, and, if applicable, the credentials and qualification requirements of the position.\u201d</li> <li>The work experience may be in Canada or abroad. \u201cDirectly related\u201d work experience is defined as experience classified under the same NOC code as the position the applicant will be taking. This is not a hard and fast rule, as the program guide states: \u201cExperience in a related occupation at a NOC level equal to or greater than the NOC code of the B.C. job offer may also be included if, at the time of application, you can satisfactorily demonstrate how this work experience is directly related.\u201d</li> </ul> </li> <li>Proof of Eligibility: To apply through Express Entry BC, applicants must provide an Express Entry Profile Number and Job Seeker Number, indicating that they meet the eligibility requirements for the Federal Skilled Worker Class, the Canadian Experience Class, or the Federal Skilled Trades Class.</li> <li>Process:<ul> <li>Those wishing to apply for a nomination from BC as a skilled worker must do so through BC PNP\u2019s online registrations system at BC PNP Online.</li> <li>After having completed the registration, the applicant receives a registration score and will be placed in a selection pool. It remains in the selection pool for up to 12 months.</li> <li>Skilled workers can only apply if they receive an invitation to apply. Invitations are issued by BC PNP periodically, setting out minimum required scores for each program and sometimes excluding some occupational codes.</li> <li>Once an applicant is invited to apply, they have 30 days to submit their application online and pay the $1,475 fee.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Activity: Issue Spotting on Job Offer Form<ul> <li>To hire a foreign national to come to BC as a skilled worker, an employer must demonstrate genuine and bona fide efforts were made to recruit from the local labour market, and that hiring the foreign national will not adversely affect employment or development opportunities for Canadian citizens and/or permanent residents.One way to meet this requirement is to first make efforts to recruit locally before making an offer to a foreign national.</li> <li>Please examine the attached job offer form, including the supporting print-out of the job posting from the Canada Job Bank.</li> <li>There are at least two problems with the job offer form.<ul> <li>(1) The job was not advertised for long enough. On page 52 of the Program Guide, it states that \u201cFor NOC Skill Type 0 or NOC Skill Level A occupations (based on the National Occupational Classification), recruitment advertisement must be for at least 14 days.\u201d  Here the advertisement was for 1 week, or 7 days.

The federal government made the class permanent in 2018.</li> <li>The current regulations for the Start-Up Business Class are now found in sections 98.01 to 98.13 of the IRPR.</li> <li>the Start-Up Business Class, the Self-Employed Persons Class, and Quebec business immigration classes.</li> <li>Subsection 98.01(1) of the IRPR establishes the Start-Up Business Class as a class of persons who may become permanent residents<ul> <li>on the basis of their ability to become economically established in Canada,</li> <li>who meet the requirements of subsection (2), and</li> <li>who intend to reside in a province or territory other than Quebec.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Subsection 98.01(2) then sets out the main requirements for the class:<ul> <li>The applicant must demonstrate official language proficiency through an approved language test. (CLB 5)</li> <li>The applicant must have sufficient settlement funds. (50% of LICO, online guide)</li> <li>The applicant must have started a qualifying business.</li> <li>The applicant must have obtained a commitment from a designated entity to support the business.</li> </ul> </li> <li>an applicant must have started a \u201cqualifying business\u201d and must have obtained a \u201ccommitment\u201d from one or more \u201cdesignated entities\u201d that is less than 6 months old.</li> <li>subsection 98.01(3) makes clear that up to 5 foreign nationals can apply as founders of the same business.</li> <li>Rules for Qualifying Businesses. There are four requirements established by subsection 98.06(1):<ul> <li>The applicant must provide active and ongoing management of the business.</li> <li>That active and ongoing management must be from within Canada.</li> <li>An essential part of the business\u2019s operations must be conducted in Canada.</li> <li>The business must be incorporated in Canada.</li> <li>The business must have an ownership structure that complies with certain percentage requirements established by the Minister of IRCC.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Currently, the ownership structure requirements established by the Minister are:<ul> <li>that each applicant must hold 10% or more of the voting rights attached to all outstanding shares of the corporation; and</li> <li>that the applicants and the designated entity that has entered into a commitment with them jointly hold more than 50% of the total voting rights attached to all outstanding shares.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> The Start-Up Business Class: Designated Entities and Commitments <ul> <li>Three kinds of organizations may be designated, as set out in subsection 98.03(1):<ul> <li>Business incubators: The IRCC website currently lists over 40 designated business incubators.</li> <li>Angel investor groups: The IRCC website currently lists 6 angel investors.</li> <li>Venture capital funds: The IRCC website currently lists 26 venture capital funds.</li> </ul> </li> <li>To be designated, an organization must belong to one of 2 industry associations, the Canadian Venture Capital &amp; Private Equity Association (for venture capital funds) or the National Angel Capital Organization (for angel investors and business incubators).</li> <li>on April 30, 2024, the Minister announced Designated Entities would only be permitted to put forward 10 applicants per year, essentially limiting the number of commitment certificates they can issue per year.</li> <li>You can find definitions of \u201cdesignated angel investor group\u201d, \u201cdesignated business incubator\u201d, and \u201cdesignated venture capital fund\u201d on the Glossary of the IRCC website.</li> <li>One difference is whose money is invested. Angel investors are made up of members who invest their own capital in start-ups, usually in exchange for equity. Venture capital funds raise and manage capital from others to place equity investments in start-ups. The two kinds of organizations also offer different kinds of help.</li> <li>Physical space and facilities. Angel investors also offer mentorship and networking; these are listed as among the kinds of support that venture capital funds provide. In addition, business incubators may provide \u201ccapital\u201d, but while this is not listed among the services that venture capital funds provide, the very point of such funds is to provide capital.</li> <li>Criteria for Designation. Under subsection 98.03(2) of the IRPR, the Minister designates business incubators, angel investors, and venture capital funds based on whether:<ul> <li>the entity is recognized for its expertise in assessing the potential for and assisting in the success of start-up business opportunities in Canada; and</li> <li>it has the ability to assess the potential for and assist in the success of start-up business opportunities in Canada.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Failure to comply with these conditions by the entities may lead to the suspension or revocation of a designation under subsections 98.03(4) and 98.03(6).</li> <li>Commitments. Designated angel investors, business incubators or venture capital funds must enter into \u201ccommitments\u201d with an applicant who has started a qualifying business in order for the applicant to be a member of the Start-Up Business Class. The formal requirements in section 98.04 include that:<ul> <li>A commitment must be in written or electronic form and must be provided by the person with the authority to bind the designated entity.</li> <li>It must include information on each applicant associated with the business.</li> <li>It must identify the applicant or applicants considered by the designated entity as essential to the business.</li> <li>The designated entity must not have charged a fee to review and assess the business proposal or business.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The commitment certificate, along with a term sheet or client agreement, must be sent to IRCC by the designated entity. The letter of support must be provided by the designated entity to the applicant. The letter must be submitted with the application.</li> <li>If an essential applicant is identified, there are two consequences:<ul> <li>First, under subsection 98.08(2), if an essential applicant is refused for any reason or withdraws their application, other applicants applying in relation to the same the business will also be refused whether or not they meet the other requirements for the class. This was confirmed in Damangir v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2024 FC 599.</li> <li>Second, the essential applicant can apply for a work permit to come to Canada to work on the business even before applying for permanent residence. The designated entity must support the application for a work permit; specifically, the commitment certificate and the letter of support must indicate that there are \u201curgent business reasons for [the essential applicant\u2019s] early entry to Canada.\u201d Applicants must submit their application for permanent residence before the commitment certificate expires.</li> </ul> </li> <li>For how long is a commitment certificate valid?<ul> <li>Answer: According to paragraph 98.01(2)(a), a commitment certificate included in an application for permanent residence under the Start-Up Business Class must be less than 6 months old.</li> <li>The operational instructions further state: Your work permit will only be valid for one year to allow you to begin working in Canada while your application for permanent residence (APR) is being processed. APRs used to be processed within a year, however are currently taking 3 years plus. However, if you need an extension, it will be considered on a case-by-case basis through the normal\u202fextension process.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Commitments from the different kinds of Designated Entities:<ul> <li>\u201ca designated angel investor group confirming that it is investing at least $75,000\u202fin a qualifying business or 2 or more designated angel investor groups confirming that they are together investing a total of at least $75,000\u202fin such a business\u201d</li> <li>\u201ca designated venture capital fund confirming that it is investing at least $200,000\u202fin a qualifying business or 2 or more designated venture capital funds confirming that they are together investing a total of at least $200,000\u202fin such a business\u201d</li> <li>\u201ca designated business incubator confirming that it is accepting the applicant into its business incubator program.\u201d</li> </ul> </li> <li>Requirements of the Commitment Certificate:<ul> <li>The commitment certificate must be issued by 1 or more designated entities.</li> <li>It must be less than 6 months old on the date of application.</li> <li>It must be issued without the designated entity charging a fee to review and assess the business proposal or to assess the business.</li> <li>It must include a term sheet/client agreement.</li> <li>It must include details of the amount of the investment and who is investing.</li> <li>It must include details of the services to be provided by the designated entity to the applicant.</li> <li>It must include details of any fees to be charged to the applicant by the designated entity (or other costs/exchange of funds) and when these fees will be collected.</li> <li>It must include information on each applicant\u202f(no more than 5\u202fpersons may be identified in a commitment to a single business proposal).</li> <li>It must describe the relationship between the applicant and the investment team.</li> <li>It must describe the business and the applicant\u2019s role in the business, including the applicant\u2019s title and any tasks the applicant is expected to perform for the company.</li> <li>It must identify those considered essential to the business.</li> </ul> </li> <li>In addition, the instructions sets out specific requirements for term sheets or client agreement, depending on whether the designated entity is an angel investor, business incubator, or venture capital fund.</li> </ul> The Start-Up Business Class: Evaluating Commitments and Substituted Evaluation <ul> <li>subsection 98.08(1) of the IRPR states:<ul> <li>If the officer is not satisfied that the entity assessed the applicant and the applicant\u2019s business in a manner consistent with industry standards or is not satisfied that the terms of the commitment are consistent with industry standards, the officer may refuse to issue the permanent resident visa.</li> </ul> </li> <li>subsection 98.09(1) of the IRPR allows an officer to request that<ul> <li>a commitment, the applicants and designated entities party to the commitment and the qualifying business to which the commitment relates be independently assessed by a peer review panel established under an agreement referred to in section 98.02 by an organization that has expertise with respect to the type of entity making the commitment.</li> </ul> </li> <li>However, under subsection 98.09(4) the officer is not bound by the review.</li> <li>Substituted Evaluation<ul> <li>section 98.10 of the IRPR provides for a power of substituted evaluation:<ul> <li>An officer may substitute their evaluation of the applicant\u2019s ability to become economically established in Canada for the requirements set out in subsection 98.01(2), if meeting or failing to meet those requirements is not a sufficient indicator of whether the applicant will become economically established in Canada.</li> </ul> </li> <li>It allows the officer essentially to override the four criteria set out in subsection 98.01(2) if they conclude those criteria do not reflect the applicant\u2019s actual ability to become economically established in Canada. As with those other provisions, exercise of the power requires the concurrence of a second officer (see IRPR, s 98.10(3)).</li> <li>Substituted evaluation cannot be used overcome an initial failure to obtain a commitment from a designated entity.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Start-Up Business Class: Legal Research Exercise <ul> <li>According to the Federal Court case law, what seems to be the most common ground for refusing applications under the Start-Up Business Class?<ul> <li>A search for \u201cstart-up business class\u201d in the Federal Court database on CanLII yielded 20 cases (the search was conducted on May 1, 2024). In 8 cases, the application was refused because the officer concluded that the applicants had embarked on the business and commitment for the primary purpose of acquiring a status or privilege under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).</li> </ul> </li> <li>What are some of the factors that have led visa officers to refuse applications on that basis?<ul> <li>Possible conflicting venture, Kwan v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 92 at para 3</li> <li>Changes to the nature of the business model, Kwan v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 92 at paras 3-4</li> <li>Payment for incubator services beyond industry standard, Kwan v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 92 at para 3</li> <li>Lack of seriousness, Kwan v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 92 at para 5</li> <li>Lack of progress in venture, Kwan v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 92 at para 6</li> <li>Lack of progress in venture and large fee paid to incubator without notation on Commitment Certificate, Ngyuen v.

Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2022 FC 1327 at para 39-42</li> </ul> </li> <li>During a peer review of the commitment, does the applicant have a right to participate?<ul> <li>Under the current case law, your client does not have a right to attend and participate at the meeting. In Bui v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 440 at paragraph 36, Justice LeBlanc writes:<ul> <li>[36]\u202f\u202fIn my view, the Panel was not required to invite the Applicant to attend the peer review. This process, I repeat, is to examine if Empowered had conducted due diligence in accepting the Applicant\u2019s business proposal, and does not focus on the conduct of the Applicant.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> Self-Employed Persons Class <ul> <li>Foreign nationals who have the intention and ability to be self-employed in Canada and to make a \u201csignificant contribution\u201d to either cultural activities or athletics.</li> <li>the Minister has paused intakes for the Self-Employed Persons Class as of April 30, 2024.</li> <li>the regulatory scheme for the Self-Employed Persons Class has two parts:<ul> <li>A minimum eligibility requirement, namely that a foreign national fall within the definition of \u201cself-employed person\u201d in subsection 88(1), and</li> <li>The ability to become economically established in Canada, which is determined according to a points system set out in sections 102 to 105.</li> </ul> </li> <li>subsection 88(1) of the IRPR states:<ul> <li>self-employed person means a foreign national who has relevant experience and has the intention and ability to be self-employed in Canada and to make a significant contribution to specified economic activities in Canada.</li> </ul> </li> <li>In Zhang v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 764, Madam Justice Walker wrote that this definition has three requirements:<ul> <li>relevant experience;</li> <li>the intention and ability to be self-employed in Canada; and</li> <li>the intention and ability to make a significant contribution to specified economic activities in Canada.</li> </ul> </li> <li>If a worker operates with significant autonomy, takes on the risk of loss and the opportunity to profit, and hires people to assist them, they are likely to be considered self-employed.</li> <li>relevant experience, in respect of<ul> <li>(a) a self-employed person, other than a self-employed person selected by a province, means a minimum of two years of experience, during the period beginning five years before the date of application for a permanent resident visa and ending on the day a determination is made in respect of the application, consisting of<ul> <li>(i) in respect of cultural activities,<ul> <li>(A) two one-year periods of experience in self-employment in cultural activities,</li> <li>(B) two one-year periods of experience in participation at a world class level in cultural activities, or</li> <li>(C) a combination of a one-year period of experience described in clause (A) and a one-year period of experience described in clause (B),</li> </ul> </li> <li>(ii) in respect of athletics,<ul> <li>(A) two one-year periods of experience in self-employment in athletics,</li> <li>(B) two one-year periods of experience in participation at a world class level in athletics, or</li> <li>(C) a combination of a one-year period of experience described in clause (A) and a one-year period of experience described in clause (B), and</li> </ul> </li> <li>(iii) in respect of the purchase and management of a farm, two one-year periods of experience in the management of a farm; and</li> </ul> </li> <li>(b) a self-employed person selected by a province, has the meaning provided by the laws of the province.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The operational instructions clarify how officers are to interpret \u201cexperience in self-employment\u201d and \u201cexperience in participation at a world class level\u201d:<ul> <li>Self-employed experience in cultural activities or athletics will capture those traditionally applying in this category, for example, music teachers, painters, illustrators, film makers, freelance journalists. Beyond that, the category is intended to capture those people who work behind the scenes as a self-employed person, for example, choreographers, set designers, coaches and trainers.</li> <li>Participation at a world-class level in cultural activities or athletics intends to capture performers. This describes those who perform in the arts, and in the world of sport. \u201cWorld class\u201d identifies persons who are known internationally. It also identifies persons who may not be known internationally but perform at the highest levels in their discipline.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Intention and Ability to be Self-Employed in Canada. The operational instructions states the following:<ul> <li>(1) sufficient funds to launch their self-employment and support themselves and their family members; and</li> <li>(2) a demonstrated past ability to support themselves and their family members through their talents.</li> </ul> </li> <li>\u201cspecific economic activities\u201d of the Self-Employed Persons will be cultural activities, athletics, or the purchase and management of a farm.</li> <li>Significant Contribution\". The operational instructions state the following:<ul> <li>It is intended that the Self-Employed Persons Class enrich Canadian culture and sports. In other words, when applicants meet the test of experience and there is a reasonable expectation they will be self-employed, the test of significant contribution becomes relative. For example, a music teacher destined to a small town can be considered significant at the local level. Likewise, a freelance journalist who contributes to a Canadian publication will meet the test.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Self-Employed Persons Class: Selection Criteria <ul> <li>the Self-Employed Persons Class is defined in subsection 100(1) IRPR as a class of persons<ul> <li>who may become permanent residents on the basis of their ability to become economically established in Canada and</li> <li>who are self-employed persons within the meaning of subsection 88(1).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Subsection 102(1) sets out the five factors to be assessed in order to determine if a foreign national and their family members will be able to become economically established in Canada:<ul> <li>age, for up to 10 points;</li> <li>education, for up to 25 points;</li> <li>proficiency in the official languages of Canada, for up to 24 points;</li> <li>experience, for up to 35 points; and</li> <li>adaptability, for up to 6 points.</li> </ul> </li> <li>108(1)(a) of the IRPR in turn states that applicants must receive the minimum number of points set by the Minister. The current minimum number of points that has been set is 35.</li> <li>Section 109 of the IRPR sets out a power of substituted evaluation.</li> </ul> Case Review <ul> <li>Zhang v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 764<ul> <li>The applicant's annual income, benefits, the length of his time on contract with the school, and the fact that he did not coach players outside the school were indicative of an employment relationship.</li> <li>Madam Justice Walker states that the definition of relevant experience \u201crequires a foreign national to establish participation at a world class level in athletics during the relevant period. It does not require the foreign national to establish participation as a world class athlete during that period.\u201d</li> </ul> </li> <li>Wei v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 982<ul> <li>At paragraph 33, Justice Annis writes that \u201cto make a significant contribution to Canadian culture, unless otherwise essential, it should not involve Chinese actors from China, or recourse to the Applicant's Chinese facilities in China to support filmmaking. In order to contribute significantly to the Canadian cultural economic scene, all aspects of the production of the films should occur to the greatest extent possible in Canada.\u201d</li> <li>How can one establish an ability to make a significant contribution to specified economic activities in Canada? By demonstrating \u201cthe possession of the means to be able and to execute the project\u201d (\u00b634)</li> <li>How can one establish an intent to make a significant contribution to specified economic activities in Canada?

Under normal circumstances, this will require a demonstration of significant pre-application efforts taken with a view to advancing a well-conceived, researched and executed project that indicates a serious possibility of economic success,\u202fsuch that it is unlikely\u202fthat the applicant would not proceed with the project so long as permanent residency is obtained to enable this to happen under normal circumstances.\u201d</li> <li>Five problems and advices:<ul> <li>Minimal role in production of film: Provide detailed information of his role and responsibilities in past projects similar to those proposed to be undertaken in Canada.</li> <li>Lack of detailed information on new project, including lack of budget: Provide as much detail as possible for proposed venture as self-employed person in Canada, including timelines, budgets, who will be hired and how, and so on.</li> <li>All workers and actors from China: Set out concrete plans to hire Canadian workers and collaborate with Canadian businesses.

The M v H case and a growing number of Charter victories by gays and lesbians resulted in a wave of legislation across Canada to recognize same-sex relationships in common law.</li> <li>In paragraphs 59 and 60, Justices Cory and Iacobacci, writing for the majority, refer to the case of Molodowich v Penttinen, 1980 CanLII 1537, 17 RFL (2d) 376 (Ont Dist Ct). They list the factors discussed in that case and add some comments regarding the necessity of a flexible approach to the application of these factors. Note that the Molodowich case is quite old and from a fairly low level of court. But by citing these factors and implicitly approving of them, the Supreme Court essentially enshrined them as the test for conjugal relationships, at least in the context of family law.<ul> <li>Molodowich v. Penttinen (1980), 1980 CanLII 1537 (ON SC), 17 R.F.L. (2d) 376 (Ont. Dist. Ct.), sets out the generally accepted characteristics of a conjugal relationship.</li> <li>They include shared shelter, sexual and personal behaviour, services, social activities, economic support and children, as well as the societal perception of the couple.</li> <li>However, it was recognized that these elements may be present in varying degrees and not all are necessary for the relationship to be found to be conjugal.  While it is true that there may not be any consensus as to the societal perception of same\u2011sex couples, there is agreement that same\u2011sex couples share many other \u201cconjugal\u201d characteristics.</li> <li>In order to come within the definition, neither opposite\u2011sex couples nor same\u2011sex couples are required to fit precisely the traditional marital model to demonstrate that the relationship is \u201cconjugal\u201d.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The importation of these factors into immigration law occurred later. It is interesting to note that Molodowich is only mentioned once in the entire SCC judgement, but it has had a substantial impact on how one might argue whether their client is in a conjugal relationship. These factors are referred to in many other cases, including in the Clouthier decision, which is in your readings list, at paragraph 13.<ul> <li>Genuineness may be assessed by reviewing a number of factors such as mutual commitment to a shared life to the exclusion of all other conjugal relationships and physical, emotional, financial and social interdependence. In M. v H., the Supreme Court of Canada adopts the seven characteristics of a conjugal relationship as set out in Molodowich:<ol> <li>Shelter - Whether the partners live together in the same home as a couple;</li> <li>Sexual and personal behaviour - Whether the partners\u2019 relationship is exclusive, committed and evidenced by emotional, intellectual and physical interaction;</li> <li>Services - Whether household and other family-type responsibilities are shared and whether there is evidence of mutual assistance especially in time of need;</li> <li>Social activities - Whether the partners share time together or participate in leisure activity together - Whether they have relationships or interaction with each other\u2019s respective family;</li> <li>Economic support - Whether the partners are financially interdependent or dependent - Whether the partners have joined, to some extent, their financial affairs (for example, as in joint-ownership of assets or arranged them to reflect their ongoing relationship) (for example, naming the other partner beneficiary in an insurance policy or will);</li> <li>Children - The partners\u2019 attitude and conduct towards children in the context of their relationship; and,</li> <li>Special perception - Whether the partners are treated or perceived by the community as a couple.</li> </ol> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> Exclusion and Inclusion of LGBTQ+ Families by Michael Battista <ul> <li>Question: When were LGBTQ+ families recognized under IRPA to permit sponsorship?<ul> <li>MB: LGBTQ families were first allowed into the family class sponsorship regime with the promulgation of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act in 2002.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Question: What impact did the M v H case have on sponsorships under Canadian immigration law?<ul> <li>MB: The impact of the M v H case on immigration sponsorships was and is profound. Using M v H, immigration policymakers have taken the principles defining a conjugal relationship for the purpose of family law and applied them to immigration law. This has led to a flexible and realistic approach to determining a genuine spousal or partner relationship which looks beyond a marriage certificate or proof of cohabitation. Often, a marriage certificate or proof of cohabitation are not realistic expectations in the immigration context.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Question: What did LGBTQ+ families do before IRPA was amended to include LGBTQ+ relationships?\u202f<ul> <li>MB: Prior to IRPA, LGBTQ+ families could not be sponsored by their same-sex Canadian partners because they did not meet the definition of \"spouse\" in the 1976 Immigration Act.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Question: Is the current definition of a spouse inclusive of LGBTQ+ relationships? What needs to be changed?<ul> <li>Same-sex couples are likely more dependent on the conjugal partner relationship category because there are fewer places in the world where they can legally marry, and cohabitation is unrealistic in the immigration context. Yet the conjugal partner relationship category involves more evidence and less guidance in adjudicating what is sufficient proof of a relationship.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Question: How are LGBTQ+ sponsorships unique in the practice sense of preparing the application or preparing for an IAD sponsorship\u202fappeal?<ul> <li>MB: Parties in LGBTQ+ relationships are usually concerned with stigma and shame, and they may fear being judged for their orientation and/or choices, or misunderstood. They may not be forthcoming with details regarding the reality and complexity of their lives and decisions.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Take Away of Top 5 Questions Asked About Family Sponsorships by Steven Meurrens <ul> <li>The difference between Family outside Canada and in Canada class:<ul> <li>The application paperwork goes to different office.</li> <li>In Canada class can still apply through outside Canada stream.</li> <li>In Canada class comes with an open work permit, typically after two to four months.

Evidence will likely be seen as more relevant, the stronger the nexus between that evidence and the issues that must be decided. For example, if an issue is whether or not the applicant is in a genuine marital relationship with their spouse, a DNA test showing that they have a child together is likely to be highly relevant. In contrast, a letter from a family friend discussing how lovely the applicant is, is likely to be deemed less relevant because it does not support or negate the key issue in the case.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>What are the primary considerations of an IRB member when assessing evidence in a proceeding?</p> <ul> <li>Pursuant to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), members of the IRB are not bound by the technical rules of evidence and may receive and base a decision on evidence that is adduced in a proceeding that is considered credible or trustworthy in the circumstances (see s 170 of the IRPA). As a result, members of the IRB must ensure that the evidence is relevant to the determination that they have to make and they must ensure that the evidence is credible and trustworthy. This includes ensuring that the evidence is coming from a reliable source and is not the product of torture.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>What are the hallmarks of \"reliable evidence\" in an IRB proceeding?</p> <ul> <li>What amounts to reliable evidence will depend on the facts and situation at hand. For example, research evidence will generally be viewed as reliable if it is recent and from a reputable source and corroborated by other sources. Evidence from witnesses will be assessed based on the witness\u2019s credibility, including the consistency of their testimony and their knowledge and ability to testify about the facts that they are testifying to. Documentary evidence is likely to be assessed based on the source of the document, the nature of the document, and whether it has internal markers of credibility (is it dated, signed, set out as such a document ought to be, etc.), and whether it can be corroborated with, or at least is consistent with, other documentation.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>As counsel for the individual in an IRB proceeding, what arguments assist in showing that more weight should be given to a certain piece of evidence?</p> <ul> <li>Establishing that the evidence has the hallmarks of reliability are important in demonstrating that the evidence that you bring forward should be given weight. Set out in your submissions where the evidence came from, and how it is supported by, or consistent with, other evidence that you have provided. Also set out other markers that would support a finding that it is credible (Is it sworn testimony? Does the evidence come from a particularly reputable or objective source? Is the evidence internally consistent? etc.). Be sure to set out how the evidence that you are putting forward actually supports the factual assertions that you are saying it supports.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>As Minister's counsel in an IRB proceeding, what arguments assist in showing that less weight should be given to a certain piece of evidence?</p> <ul> <li>Demonstrating that evidence does not have the hallmarks of credibility or reliability will help to ensure that the evidence is given less weight in a proceeding. Arguments which demonstrate that the evidence is inconsistent with, or not supported by, any other evidence are often useful in demonstrating that the evidence should be given little weight. Arguments that demonstrate that the evidence is self-serving, not from a reliable source, and does not have other indicators of reliability (e.g., a letter that is unsigned or not dated, receipts that do not have information about what they are for, etc.) also assist in establishing that little weight should be given to the evidence. Finally, pointing out that the evidence being offered does not actually support the proposition that it is said to support can also assist in showing that less weight should be given to that evidence.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>How does an individual's credibility impact on the weighing of evidence?</p> <ul> <li>Generally the more credible a person\u2019s evidence the more weight it will be given. Similarly the less credible a person\u2019s evidence the less weight their testimony will be given. The caveat here is that in addition to credibility the person\u2019s evidence must be relevant to the decision makers determination to be given weight. For example, a person can testify credibly that the applicant always pays their rent on time. But if the issue at hand is whether the applicant is in a genuine marital relationship with somebody, that credible testimony may not be relevant in which case it won\u2019t be given weight in the member\u2019s assessment.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>When the \"burden of proof\" rests on the appellant, claimant, or person concerned, what does this mean?</p> <ul> <li>The party that has the burden of proof is responsible for leading enough credible and trustworthy evidence to establish their case on a particular standard of proof. In a sponsorship appeal hearing, that standard of proof is a balance of probabilities which means that the party with the burden of proof must show that it is more likely than not that their version of events occurred. In such cases, if the member finds that either outcome is equally likely, then the party with the burden of proof would lose as they would not have established their case to the necessary standard.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>What is the standard of proof that the IAD member applies to sponsorship appeal hearings?</p> <ul> <li>The standard of proof in a sponsorship appeal hearing is a balance of probabilities. That is, the party with the burden of proof has to establish that it is more likely than not (50% + 1) that their version of events occurred.</li> </ul> </li> </ol>","tags":["ICL850","Notes","Quizzes"]},{"location":"immigration/850/ICL850week4/#quizzes","title":"Quizzes","text":"Module 4 Knowledge Check <ol> <li> <p>Jenny is an immigration consultant.

(Select all that apply.)</p> <ul> <li> That it may be difficult for the couple to display their relationship publicly.</li> <li> That it may be difficult for the couple to confirm the relationship by showing evidence of economic support for one another.</li> <li> That the couple's relationship may not evolve along the same trajectory as that of an opposite-sex couple.</li> <li> That it may be difficult for the couple to verify the relationship (e.g., showing evidence of living together). <p>Each of the above factors should be considered by the IAD in assessing the genuineness of a SOGIE-diverse relationship in accordance with Sections 10.1 and 10.2 of the Chairperson's Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB involving SOGIE.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Charlie, a Canadian Citizen, and Hayden, a foreign national, are appealing a sponsorship application refusal based on the genuineness of their relationship.

The Federal Court has repeatedly criticized the rejection of evidence provided by relatives and family members of an applicant solely because such evidence is self-serving. In Magonza, the Federal Court observed that it is a reviewable error to dismiss evidence in its entirety for the sole reason that it is self-interested.

In accordance with Magonza v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) 2019 FC 14 (para 16), credibility is the answer to the question \"is this a trustworthy source of information?\" The issue, however, also concerns the weight of the evidence, as the weight of evidence is a function of both credibility and probative value.

Following his testimony, Jose opted not to call his wife to testify though she was at the hearing and able to do so. Which of the following statements is correct?</p> <ul> <li> The IAD should draw a negative inference from Jose's wife not testifying because she was available to testify.</li> <li> The IAD should draw a negative inference from Jose's wife not testifying as both the sponsor and applicant are required to testify in an appeal before the IAD.</li> <li> The IAD should not draw a negative inference from Jose's wife not testifying as an applicant is not required to testify in all appeals.</li> <li> Both a) and b). <p>In accordance with Mann v Canada 2005 CanLII 56894 (CA IRB) (at para 9), \"the applicant is not required to testify in all appeals.

As George is fluent in English and Tina is not, he is the one who completed the application. Tina has a very minimal understanding of English and signs the papers that George sends to her without reading them carefully. When IRCC reviews the application, the officer discovers that there are major inconsistencies between the sponsorship application and a previous application for a temporary residence visa that Tina applied for 2 years ago. The officer determines that Tina is inadmissible on the grounds of misrepresentation under section 40 of the IRPA. Is Tina admissible?</p> <ul> <li> No, Tina is inadmissible because she should have asked George to read the full application to her in a language that she understands before signing.</li> <li> Yes, Tina is admissible because neither she nor George intended to deceive IRCC, and the mistakes were inadvertent.</li> <li> Yes, Tina is admissible because she was not the one who filled out the application and should not be held responsible for the mistakes that George made without her knowing.</li> <li> No, Tina is inadmissible for indirect misrepresentation as her sponsor completed an application for her and included incorrect information without her knowledge.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Raj had applied for and received permanent residence in Canada as the result of an overseas sponsorship. In his application, Raj omitted listing his 6-year-old child from a previous relationship. Raj was of the belief that he was to include only his current wife and children in the application and that when he would be interviewed by an immigration officer, he would inform the officers about his child from his previous relationship. He was, however, not interviewed by an officer and was instead granted permanent residence. Will Raj be permitted to sponsor his 6-year-old child?</p> <ul> <li> Yes, if Raj can prove that the omission was not fraudulent then he can keep his permanent residency and his child can come to Canada as a dependent.</li> <li> No, Raj will face lifetime exclusion for failing to mention all his dependents in his application.</li> <li> Yes, Raj will be permitted to sponsor his child in accordance with an Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) public policy to avoid the application of provisions 117(9)(d) and 125(1)(d) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR).</li> <li> Raj must make an application under the Humanitarian and Compassionate (H&amp;C) category seeking forgiveness for his omission from the Minister responsible. <p>Yes, there is a public policy under R.117 (9)(d), wherein a temporary policy has been introduced for certain persons excluded under paragraph 117(9)(d) and 125(1)(d) of the IRPR. This policy allows applicants under the family class such as Raj to seek exemption under this policy, provided he meets its requirements.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Ahmed is eager to sponsor his mother, who resides in Lebanon. Living with his father, Karim, in Toronto, Ontario, Ahmed faces challenges meeting the minimum income requirements for sponsorship on his own. Fortunately, his father, Karim, a permanent resident of Canada for the past 5 years and divorced from Ahmed's mother, has agreed to co-sign the application. Ahmed is hopeful that the combined income of both himself and his father will fulfill the minimum requirements. Will Ahmed's father, Karim, be allowed to co-sign the application?</p> <ul> <li> No, Ahmed's father cannot co-sign the application because he is elderly, and IRCC will not be satisfied that he can meet the obligation for a 20-year undertaking required to sponsor a parent or grandparent.</li> <li> No, Ahmed's father cannot co-sign the application because only a spouse or common-law partner of a sponsor is permitted to be a co-signer on the sponsorship application.</li> <li> Yes, Ahmed's father is permitted to co-sign the application as long as he provides proof of income from the Canada Revenue Agency for the three consecutive taxation years immediately preceding the date of the sponsorship application.</li> <li> Yes, Ahmed's father is permitted to co-sign the application because Ahmed's mother will be moving in with both of them, and they can jointly cover her expenses.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Nour, an applicant for permanent residence in Canada, unintentionally provided incorrect information about her work experience in her application. The immigration authorities later discovered the error and determined it as misrepresentation.

She provided all of the necessary documents and application criteria to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and is waiting for her parents to complete their medical tests in order to receive their permanent residence. As part of her application package, Amelia provided her Notice of Assessment from the Canada Revenue Agency for the previous three years, which showed that she was making the minimum necessary income (MNI) to be approved for sponsorship. While waiting for her parents to receive their visas, Amelia was laid off from work and no longer has any income. Will losing her job be a problem even though she has already been approved as the sponsor?</p> <ul> <li> No, Amelia does not need to worry because she already gave all of the evidence that was necessary to prove that she met the requirements to sponsor.</li> <li> Yes, Amelia does need to be concerned and aware that a sponsor must continue to meet the minimum necessary income (MNI) until the day their sponsored family members are granted permanent resident status.</li> <li> Yes, Amelia does need to be concerned and aware that once her parents arrive, she will have to show IRCC her plan to pay for them to stay with her for a period of 20 years.</li> <li> No, Amelia does not need to worry because no one at IRCC will check to see what her ongoing income is. They only cared about what her previous income was in processing the application. <p>Amelia must meet the MNI on application and approval.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Kelly is a citizen of Canada and a resident of Ontario. Kelly suffers from a disability. She wants to sponsor her spouse, a citizen of Jamaica, but she is not sure if she can do so since she receives assistance for her physical disability. Which advice to Kelly would be the most correct and prudent?</p> <ul> <li> Persons with any disability cannot sponsor anybody irrespective of their need for disability benefits.</li> <li> Persons with disabilities can sponsor individuals that qualify under the Family Class even if they are on disability benefits.</li> <li> Persons with disabilities can sponsor individuals that qualify under the Family Class if they have a guarantor that can co-sign for financial support.</li> <li> Persons with disabilities can sponsor individuals that qualify under the Family Class if the disability benefit provided is not more than 35% percent of their total income. <p>See IRPR s. 133(1)(k) is not in receipt of social assistance for a reason other than disability.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Tom, a foreign national, was convicted of impaired driving in Canada and thereafter was granted a record suspension (formerly a pardon). For the purposes of immigration, will Tom be considered admissible to Canada?</p> <ul> <li> No, a record suspension does not overcome a conviction for the purposes of immigration to Canada.</li> <li> Yes, a record suspension would make Tom admissible in Canada.</li> <li> No, Tom is a threat to Canadian society and therefore will remain inadmissible in Canada.</li> <li> Yes, but only if he can pay monetary compensation to the pedestrian's family and they agree to co-sign the suspension then he will be admissible in Canada. <p>s. 36 of the IRPA requires a conviction. The effect of a record suspension is the removal of the conviction.

He was pleased to receive a notice from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (\"IRCC\") that he was approved to be a sponsor for David, but unfortunately, his application was refused at the second stage of processing due to his failure to meet the requirements for sponsorship. Julian is now looking for help to decide if he can appeal or not.</p> <ul> <li> No, Julian cannot appeal the negative decision to the IAD because a Canadian citizen is only able to appeal the decision about a spouse, common law partner, or conjugal partner, not a decision about a child.</li> <li> No, Julian can only appeal a negative decision about his eligibility to be a sponsor. Since he was approved to be a sponsor for David, he is not able to appeal to the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD).</li> <li> Yes, Julian can appeal the decision to the IAD. An application that is refused due to the failure of a sponsor to meet the requirements for sponsorship may be appealed to the IAD.</li> <li> Yes, Julian can appeal the decision to the IAD on the basis that he is a Canadian citizen and therefore has every right and entitlement to appeal any decision on an application he makes to IRCC. <p>Under section 62(1) of the IRPA, a member of the family class may appeal to the IAD.

Two weeks before he was set to travel to Canada, he married his partner, Samar. He was worried that if he disclosed this information to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) he might get into trouble, and he would not be allowed to resettle to Canada, so he did not tell anyone about his new wife. In 2018 Aram filed an application to sponsor his wife under the Family Class and was denied because he had not previously disclosed his relationship. Can Aram apply to sponsor his wife under the new IRCC public policy to avoid the application of provisions 117(9)(d) and 125(1)(d) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR)?</p> <ul> <li> No, Aram will not be permitted to apply under the public policy as he knowingly did not disclose his wife to IRCC when he became a permanent resident.</li> <li> Yes, Aram will be permitted to apply to sponsor his wife in accordance with the IRCC public policy to avoid the application of provisions 117(9)(d) and 125(1)(d) of the IRPR.</li> <li> No, the only way that Aram would be able to sponsor his previously undisclosed wife would be to ask for consideration on Humanitarian and Compassionate grounds under section 25(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).</li> <li> No, Aram would have to show that he did not intentionally avoid disclosing his wife to IRCC when he did not disclose his spouse in order to take advantage of the IRCC public policy to avoid the application of provision 117(9)(d) and 125(1)(d) of the IRPR.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>According to Section 130(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR), what are the eligibility requirements for an individual to sponsor a foreign national under the family class or spouse or common-law partner in Canada class?</p> <ul> <li> The sponsor must be a permanent resident, at least 18 years of age, residing in Canada, and have filed a sponsorship application in the past two years.</li> <li> The sponsor can be any individual regardless of citizenship or age,residing in Canada, and must have filed a sponsorship application.</li> <li> The sponsor must be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident, at least 21 years of age, residing in Canada, and have filed a sponsorship application.</li> <li> The sponsor must be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident, at least 18 years of age, residing in Canada, and have filed a sponsorship application. <p>The correct answer reflects the eligibility criteria outlined in Section 130(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, which specifies that a sponsor must be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident, at least 18 years of age, residing in Canada, and have filed a sponsorship application.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Matthew wishes to sponsor his wife and two youngest children to join him in Canada. He has an older daughter, Courtney, who is 19 years old and is studying at university to become a doctor. She does not wish to join Matthew in Canada with the rest of her family, because she wants to complete her education in her home country and become a doctor there. When filling out the application, Matthew is confused as to whether he should still list Courtney or not in the application forms. What would you advise Matthew in this situation?</p> <ul> <li> Because Courtney is choosing to remain in her home country of her own free will she does not need to be included on Matthew's forms. She only needs to include dependent family members who will be processed to join him in Canada through the sponsorship.</li> <li> Matthew can choose to list Courtney on his forms if he would like, but he isn't required to do so, and there will not be any immigration consequences if he leaves her out.</li> <li> Because Courtney is over the age of 18, she does not need to be listed on Matthew's application forms.</li> <li> Matthew must list Courtney on the forms even though she does not wish to accompany him to Canada. All dependent family members must be listed in the application forms, whether they are accompanying the applicant to Canada or not.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>According to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR), a foreign national shall not be considered a spouse, a common-law partner, or a conjugal partner if the marriage, common-law partnership, or conjugal partnership is:</p> <ul> <li> solely for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the Act.</li> <li> a genuine relationship.</li> <li> entered into without proper documentation.</li> <li> primarily for financial gain.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>On January 13, 2023, Amber submitted an application from within Canada to be sponsored by her wife, Ingrid, who is a permanent resident. She received a notice from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (\"IRCC\") that her application had been received, checked for completeness, and was now being reviewed by an immigration officer. On March 14, 2023, Amber learned that her wife, Ingrid, is now being investigated because IRCC believes that she obtained her own permanent residence through misrepresenting important facts about her work experience in her home country and she might not have been eligible for permanent residence at all. Amber is worried that this will impact her spousal sponsorship application. What should you advise Amber?</p> <ul> <li> Sponsorship applications can be suspended if proceedings are brought against the sponsor or co-signer that challenge the validity of the sponsor's own immigration status for matters such as misrepresentation.</li> <li> Sponsorship applications can only be suspended if proceedings are brought against the sponsor or co-signer for serious matters involving criminality.</li> <li> Sponsorship applications can only be suspended if proceedings are brought against the sponsor or co-signer for financial reasons.</li> <li> Once sponsorship applications have been received by IRCC they cannot be suspended until a final decision on the application has been rendered. <p>Under R136(1)(b), if the sponsor is the subject of an inadmissibility report, the sponsorship application may be suspended.

If they are removed from Canada to their country of origin, they risk being persecuted for their religion. They are thus protected against removal unless they are inadmissible to Canada based on grounds of:</p> <ul> <li> Serious criminality</li> <li> Gross misrepresentation</li> <li> Non-compliance with the Act</li> <li> All of the above</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Which of the following do not have to be established in order for a claimant to be accepted as a Convention Refugee under s. 96 of IRPA?</p> <ul> <li> That the nature of the persecution amounts to risk to life, torture, or cruel and unusual treatment</li> <li> The grounds of persecution must be linked to one of the five enumerated grounds</li> <li> That the claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution</li> <li> The claimant's identity</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>One year ago, James beat up Tommy in their native country. Tommy\u2019s father, a corrupt judge, arranged to have James convicted and sentenced to the maximum term of imprisonment, 14 years. James managed to escape and flee to Thailand, where he claimed refugee status from UNHCR. UNHCR rejected his claim. James then flew to Canada and claimed refugee protection at the airport. In Canada, the offence of assault is a hybrid offence punishable on indictment by up to 5 years\u2019 imprisonment. Will James\u2019s claim for refugee protection in Canada be eligible? Please select the best answer. Assume there are no other relevant facts that might render him ineligible.</p> <ul> <li> No. James is ineligible under s. 99(3) of the IRPA because he should be subject to a removal order for coming to Canada without status.</li> <li> No. James is rendered ineligible by virtue of s. 101(1)(b) of the IRPA because his claim has been rejected by UNHCR.</li> <li> No. James is ineligible by virtue of s. 101(1)(f) and 101(2)(a) of the IRPA because he was sentenced to 14 years imprisonment.</li> <li> Yes. Despite the sentence received in his country, James's offence is not sufficiently serious to render him ineligible according to s. 101(1)(f) and 101(2)(b) of the IRPA.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Joanna\u2019s refugee claim was denied on credibility. The RPD found that Joanna\u2019s claim was not credible because she did not provide enough supporting documents. The RPD\u2019s decision is most vulnerable to criticism because it violated which principle set out in The Federal Court of Appeal decision in Maldonado v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1980] 2 F.C.\u202f302 (C.A.)?</p> <ul> <li> That the Refugee Protection Division must consider whether a claimant has acceptable identity documents when assessing their credibility</li> <li> That the Refugee Protection Division must presume a claimant's allegations are true unless there is a reason to doubt their truthfulness</li> <li> That, while the onus in establishing a claim lies with the claimant, the Refugee Protection Division must consider issues that emerge perceptibly from the record</li> <li> That the Refugee Protection Division must only consider evidence that is considered credible and trustworthy in the circumstances</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Julia\u2019s father intends to force her to marry the nephew of a local crime boss. Which of the following evidentiary factors may be considered by the Refugee Protection Division in determining whether Julia has rebutted the presumption of state protection?</p> <ul> <li> Whether Julia can live alone away from her father in another city</li> <li> The protection afforded to other similarly situated young women facing forced marriage in a neighbouring country</li> <li> Whether Julia made efforts to seek protection from the police or other authorities</li> <li> Whether Julia's mother can stand up to her father on her behalf</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The evidence in a claim establishes the following on a balance of probabilities: Omega is facing arrest after publishing a leaflet. In it, she criticized the ruling political party\u2019s policies with respect to a religious minority. Omega is not a member of that religious minority, and the authorities do not believe she is.

If found eligible, refugee protection claims are decided by the Immigration and Refugee Board (or IRB), more specifically the two divisions of the Board that deal with refugee matters - the Refugee Protection Division (or RPD) and the Refugee Appeal Division (or RAD).</li> <li>Time limit for appeal<ul> <li>R159.91 (1) Subject to subsection (2), for the purpose of subsection 110(2.1) of the Act,<ul> <li>(a) the time limit for a person or the Minister to file an appeal to the Refugee Appeal Division against a decision of the Refugee Protection Division is 15 days after the day on which the person or the Minister receives written reasons for the decision; and</li> <li>(b) the time limit for a person or the Minister to perfect such an appeal is 30 days after the day on which the person or the Minister receives written reasons for the decision.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Extension: (2) If the appeal cannot be filed within the time limit set out in paragraph (1)(a) or perfected within the time limit set out in paragraph (1)(b), the Refugee Appeal Division may, for reasons of fairness and natural justice, extend each of those time limits by the number of days that is necessary in the circumstances.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Making a Refugee Protection Claim <ul> <li>A95 establishes a foundation for understanding the framework regarding claiming refugee protection in Canada.</li> <li>A95(1) sets out three ways a person may apply for refugee protection.<ul> <li>Apply for a visa from abroad to be resettled to Canada as a Convention refugee or a person in similar circumstances. We will address resettlement as a refugee from abroad in Module 8.</li> <li>Making a claim for \u201crefugee protection\u201d, which will be processed by the Refugee Protection Division, or RPD, and possibly the Refugee Appeal Division, or RAD, of the IRB. Such claims will be the focus of this module.</li> <li>Make a claim for \u201cprotection\u201d by applying for a pre-removal risk assessment. Pre-removal risk assessments are dealt with in the course on Enforcement (ICL 870).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Sections 99 to 105 provide the framework for making claims that go to the IRB.<ul> <li>These provisions first of all set out how and where to make a claim (section 99).</li> <li>Second, they set out the process for assessing eligibility and the grounds for deeming a claim to be ineligible to go before the RPD (sections 100-101).</li> <li>Third, they set out the grounds for suspending or terminating proceedings before the RPD or the RAD (sections 103-105).</li> </ul> </li> <li>How and Where To Make a Claim (Section 99)<ul> <li>Claims made by a person in Canada may be made either:<ul> <li>at a port-of-entry, such as an official border crossing or an airport;</li> <li>within Canadian territory (\u201cinside Canada other than at a port of entry\u201d).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Can Canadian citizens make a claim for refugee protection?<ul> <li>No. As confirmed by the operational instructions, Canadian citizens may not make a claim for refugee protection. However, claims may be made by both foreign nationals and permanent residents.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Claims at Port of Entry<ul> <li>Claims at a port of entry are made to officers of the Canada Border Services Agency, or CBSA</li> <li>Claimants will be asked to fill out several forms, including the Generic Application Form for Canada (IMM 0008) and provide supporting documents (as described on the IRCC page, Applying for Refugee Protection from within Canada (IMM 5746))</li> <li>The officer will seize claimants' passport and travel documents (providing claimants with true copies of genuine passports and travel documents)</li> <li>The Claimant must submit the Basis of Claim (BOC) to the IRB within 15 days, in accordance with subsection 159.8(2) of the IRPR. It is possible to apply for an extension of time under subsection 159.8(3) of the IRPR and rule 8 of the RPD Rules.</li> <li>Claimants will also be issued a conditional removal order, in most cases because they are considered to be in non-compliance with the IRPA (under section 41 of the IRPA). The removal order comes into force once the claim has been rejected, abandoned, or withdrawn.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Claims from inside Canada<ul> <li>Claims for refugee protection made inside Canada other than at a port of entry are made to officers of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, or IRCC.</li> <li>Persons making claims to IRCC officers will have to submit the various application forms and the completed BOC to the IRCC officer when they make their application. They will also be interviewed and, in most cases, issued a conditional removal order.</li> <li>The IRCC recently changed their inland claims process and requires refugee claimants to initiate their claims through the online portal.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Eligibility Determinations (Sections 100 and 101)<ul> <li>Once a person has made an application for refugee protection to a CBSA or an IRCC officer, either at a port of entry or inland, the officer will interview them to determine their eligibility.</li> <li>The grounds for ineligibility are as follows:<ul> <li>That refugee protection has been conferred on the claimant in Canada.</li> <li>That a claim for refugee protection by the claimant has been rejected by the IRB.</li> <li>That a prior claim by the claimant was determined to be ineligible to be referred to the RPD, or to have been withdrawn or abandoned.<ul> <li>A withdrawal occurs when a claimant chooses not to pursue their claim and formally withdraws it.</li> <li>An abandonment is a determination by the RPD or RAD that a claimant is in default in the proceedings, including by failing to appear. In other words, it is a deemed rejection in response to a lack of diligence.</li> <li>Withdrawals and abandonments are governed by section 168 of the IRPA, rules 59 and 65 of the RPD rules, and rules 47 and 68 of the RAD Rules.</li> </ul> </li> <li>That the claimant has, before making a claim for refugee protection in Canada, made a claim for refugee protection to a country other than Canada, and the fact of its having been made has been confirmed under an information-sharing agreement with that other country.<ul> <li>This ground of ineligibility was introduced in 2019. The countries with which Canada has an \u201cinformation sharing\u201d agreement are Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States. Persons found ineligible on this ground may apply for a pre-removal risk assessment, with respect to which they are entitled to an oral hearing.</li> </ul> </li> <li>That the claimant has been recognized as a Convention refugee by a country other than Canada and can be sent or returned to that country.</li> <li>That the claimant came directly or indirectly to Canada from a country designated by the regulations, other than a country of their nationality or their former habitual residence.<ul> <li>This ground of ineligibility refers to the Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA) with the United States, which is the only country designated (under section 159.3 of the Regulations). The STCA is discussed by Desloges and Sawicki in section II.B of Chapter 13.</li> <li>Note, however, that the constitutional challenge to the ongoing applicability of the STCA was successful before the Federal Court in Canadian Council for Refugees v Canada (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship), 2020 FC 770.  However, the Federal Court of Appeal overturned that decision Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Canadian Council for Refugees, 2021 FCA 72.</li> <li>That decision is currently under appeal. However, if the determination that paragraph 101(1)(e) of the IRPA and section 159.3 of the IRPR are unconstitutional is upheld on appeal, then paragraph 110(2)(d) would cease to have any application. Pending appeal, the STCA and its implementing provisions remain in force. Thus the fate of the STCA, its implementing provisions, and paragraph 110(2)(d) of the IRPA in particular, is uncertain at this time.</li> </ul> </li> <li>That the claimant has been determined to be inadmissible on grounds of security, violating human or international rights, serious criminality or organized criminality, except for persons who are inadmissible solely on the grounds of paragraph 35(1)(c).</li> <li>In addition to the listed grounds of ineligibility in section 101, subsection 99(3) provides that a claim for refugee protection may not be made by someone who is the subject of a removal order.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The officer will provide the claimant with a Confirmation of Referral form. For claims made at a port of entry, the Confirmation of Referral will also include the deadline for submitting the Basis of Claim (BOC) form - 15 days after the claim is referred. For claims inland, the BOC must be submitted to an officer via the online portal.</li> <li>Although rule 3 of the RPD Rules requires officers to fix the date, time and location of a hearing, that has not been the practice since 2018. Claims are heard on a first-in, first-out basis. The Notice to Appear with a hearing date for the claim is provided to claimants later by the IRB.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Suspension or Termination (sections 103 to 105 of the IRPA)</li> </ul> Refugee Protection Division and Refugee Appeal Division: The Statutory Framework <ul> <li>Sections 162 to 169 of the IRPA set out rules governing all 4 IRB divisions, including the RPD and the RAD.</li> <li>Sole and exclusive jurisdiction<ul> <li>162(1)\u202fEach Division of the Board has, in respect of proceedings brought before it under this Act, sole and exclusive jurisdiction to hear and determine all questions of law and fact, including questions of jurisdiction.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Procedure<ul> <li>162(2)\u202fEach Division shall deal with all proceedings before it as informally and quickly as the circumstances and the considerations of fairness and natural justice permit.</li> </ul> </li> <li>What factors determine the requirements of procedural fairness before the RPD and RAD?<ul> <li>As set out in Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 SCR 817, the requirements for procedural fairness before an administrative tribunal \u2013 like the RPD or RAD \u2013 are determined by examining the following non-exhaustive list of 5 factors:<ul> <li>(1) the nature of the decision being made and process followed in making it;</li> <li>(2) the nature of the statutory scheme and the terms of the statute pursuant to which the body operates;</li> <li>(3)\u202fthe importance of the decision to the individual or individuals affected;</li> <li>(4) the legitimate expectations of the person challenging the decision;</li> <li>(5) the choices of procedure made by the agency itself.\u202f</li> </ul> </li> <li>As we will see when reading Thamotharem v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2007 FCA 198, the procedural requirements before the RPD and RAD have generally be held to be high, in part because of the importance of the decision to refugee protection claimants.</li> </ul> </li> <li>RPD and RAD: Inquisitorial, not Adversarial<ul> <li>section 165 of the IRPA gives them the authority to summon witnesses and to require witnesses to give evidence, orally in or in writing, or to produce documents.</li> <li>This provision confirms that proceedings before the RPD and RAD are meant to be inquisitorial, rather than adversarial. The member is to play an active role in questioning witnesses and determining how evidence is to be elicited during proceedings.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Proceedings<ul> <li>in principle, proceedings must be held in public</li> <li>but proceedings before the Refugee Protection Division and the Refugee Appeal Division must be held in the absence of the public;</li> </ul> </li> <li>The Right to Counsel &amp; Representation<ul> <li>subsection 167(1) of the IRPA provides a right to be represented by counsel before the IRB. Subsection 167(2) of the IRPA provides a right to have the division designate a representative for persons who are under 18 years of age or who are \u201cunable to appreciate the nature of the proceedings.\u201d</li> <li>RPD rule 20 provides the duties of a designated representative include deciding whether to retain counsel, making decisions regarding the claim, assisting in gathering evidence, and filing an appeal with the RAD, if necessary.</li> <li>RAD rule 23 includes many of the same requirements. The rule also states that if someone has been a designated representative for a claimant before the RPD, they are deemed to have been designated as a representative by the RAD on appeal.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Abandonment &amp; Withdrawals<ul> <li>Section 168 is very important, as it governs abandonments and withdrawals.</li> <li>RPD Rule 65 provides that before a claim can be declared abandoned, the Division must give the claimant the opportunity to explain why it should not be.</li> <li>RAD Rule 68 is similar, although it only applies if a hearing has been scheduled.</li> <li>It is very important to avoid abandonment. If a claim or appeal has been declared abandoned, under RPD Rule 62 or RAD rule 49, it may only be reopened if there was a failure of natural justice.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> The Refugee Protection Division <ul> <li>Section 96 reproduces in its essentials the refugee definition from the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. Persons falling within section 96 are referred to as \u201cConvention refugees\u201d in the IRPA.</li> <li>Persons falling under section 97 are referred to as \u201cpersons in need of protection\u201d in the IRPA.<ul> <li>Note that \u201cpersons in need of protection\u201d as defined in section 97 are distinct from \u201cprotected persons\u201d who receive refugee protection under section 95. Being a person in need of protection is one ground for receiving refugee protection, hence for becoming a protected person. Not all protected persons, however, are persons in need of protection. Some of them may simply be Convention refugees.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Persons falling under section 98 are expressly excluded from the definitions in sections 96 and 97 and hence cannot receive refugee protection.</li> <li>subsection 107(1) states that the RPD shall accept a claim for refugee protection if the claimant is either a Convention refugee (i.e., if they fall within section 96) or a person in need of protection (i.e., if they fall within section 97). Otherwise, the RPD shall reject the claim.<ul> <li>First, it uses the mandatory \u201cshall\u201d, rather than the discretionary \u201cmay.\u201d Second, no other criteria are mentioned other than those found in sections 96 and 97.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Subsection 107(2) requires the RPD, if it is of the opinion that there was no credible or trustworthy evidence on which it could have made a favourable decision, to state that there is \u201cno credible basis\u201d for the claim. The leading case on \u201cno credible basis\u201d statements is Rahaman v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 FCA 89.</li> <li>Section 107.1 states that if the RPD, in rejecting a claim, is of the opinion that a claim is clearly fraudulent, it must state in its decision that the claim was \u201cmanifestly unfounded\u201d. To make such a declaration, the RPD member must have a firm conviction that refugee protection is sought through fraudulent means that go to the core of the claim (see He v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 2 at paragraph 21; Warsame v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration),\u202f2016 FC 596\u202fat paragraphs 31 and 36).</li> <li>Under paragraph 110(2)(c) of the IRPA, if the RPD makes a declaration that a claim has no credible basis or is manifestly unfounded, then the decision may not be appealed to the RAD.</li> <li>paragraphs 170(b) and 170(f) provide that in most cases the RPD must hold a hearing and give notice of the hearing to the claimant and the Minister. However, the RPD may decide not to hold a hearing if a claim is allowed, and the Minister has not given notice of an intention to intervene.</li> </ul> The Refugee Appeal Division <ul> <li>The provisions governing the RAD are found in sections 110-111 and 171-171.1 of the IRPA.</li> <li>The RAD has been designed to be a primarily paper-based appeal of the RPD\u2019s decision, with very limited powers to either receive new evidence or to hold oral hearings. It reviews RPD decisions on a correctness standard (see Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Huruglica, 2016 FCA 93)</li> <li>Seven Grounds For Denying a Right of Appeal<ul> <li>Designated Foreign Nationals: paragraph 110(2)(a) of the IRPA, an RPD decision concerning a \u201cdesignated foreign national\u201d may not be appealed. This is a reference to section 20.1 of the IRPA, which empowers the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness to designate certain groups arriving in Canada as \u201cirregular arrivals.\u201d Foreign national belonging to a group whose arrival was designated irregular are deemed \u201cdesignated foreign nationals.\u201d the government has used this designation power in only a very small number of cases, and not at all since the first weeks immediately after section 20.1 came into force in December 2012.</li> <li>Withdrawn or Abandoned Claims: paragraph 110(2)(b) of the IRPA, there is no appeal from a decision by the RPD that a claim has been withdrawn or abandoned, in accordance with section 168 of the IRPA. The only recourse for a person whose claim has been determined to be withdrawn or abandoned by the RPD is to seek to reinstate (in the case of a withdrawal) or reopen (in the case of an abandonment) the claim before the RPD (Rules 60 and 62 of the RPD Rules govern reinstatements and reopenings, respectively).</li> <li>No Credible Basis: under paragraph 110(2)(c) of the IRPA, there is no appeal from a decision by the RPD rejecting a claim that states that the claim has no credible basis or is manifestly unfounded, in accordance with subsection 107(2) and section 107.1.</li> <li>Safe Third Country Agreement: under paragraph 110(2)(d) of the IRPA, there is no right of appeal for foreign nationals who were able to come to Canada and claim refugee protection from the United States under an exemption to the Safe Third Country Agreement, or STCA.<ul> <li>The provisions implementing the STCA \u2013 paragraph 101(1)(e) of the IRPA and section 159.3 of the IRPR, designating the United States \u2013 were successfully challenged under the Charter in Canadian Council for Refugees v. Canada (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship), 2020 FC 770. However, the Federal Court of Appeal overturned that decision Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Canadian Council for Refugees, 2021 FCA 72.</li> <li>if the determination that paragraph 101(1)(e) of the IRPA and section 159.3 of the IRPR are unconstitutional is upheld on appeal, then paragraph 110(2)(d) would cease to have any application.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Designated Countries of Origin: Paragraph 110(2)(d.1) denied appeals from a decision concerning foreign nationals who were citizens of countries designated under section 109.1 of the IRPA. However, paragraph 110(2)(d.1) was declared unconstitutionally discriminatory under section 15 of the Charter in Y.Z. v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 892. The Y.Z. decision was not appealed. Therefore, paragraph 110(2)(d.1) is of no force or effect.</li> <li>Cessation: 110(2)(e) a decision of the Refugee Protection Division allowing or rejecting an application by the Minister for a determination that refugee protection has ceased;</li> <li>Vacation of Refugee Protection: paragraph 110(2)(f) of the IRPA bars appeals from decisions of the RPD allowing or rejecting an application under section 109 by the Minister to vacate a decision to allow a claim for refugee protection.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Under rule 3 of the RAD Rules, a perfected record must include:<ul> <li>The notice of decision and written reasons of the RPD.</li> <li>All or part of the transcript of the RPD decision, if the appellant wants to use it in the appeal.</li> <li>Any documents that the RPD refused to accept as evidence if you want to use those documents in support of your appeal.</li> <li>A written statement that states whether you are submitting new evidence that that was not submitted to the RPD and whether you are requesting an oral hearing on the basis of that evidence.</li> <li>Legal authorities that support your arguments on appeal.</li> <li>A memorandum of argument.</li> </ul> </li> <li>subsection 110(4): On appeal, the person who is the subject of the appeal may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim or that was not reasonably available, or that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection.</li> <li>The Court of Appeal In Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Singh, 2016 FCA 96 at paragraph 34 stated that subsection 110(4) only allows for the submission of evidence<ul> <li>that arose after the rejection of the claim;</li> <li>that was not reasonably available; or</li> <li>that was reasonably available, but that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection.</li> </ul> </li> <li>subsection 110(5) states that the restrictions on new evidence in subsection 110(4) do not apply when a claimant is responding to evidence submitted by the Minister.</li> <li>Subsection 110(6) of the IRPA significantly limits the availability of oral hearings at the RAD. the RAD may only hold oral hearings to resolve determinative issues of credibility arising out of evidence that was not part of the RPD record. Even when there is new evidence that meets those criteria, the power to hold a hearing or not is still discretionary (on this point, see Oluwakemi v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 973 at paragraph 7).</li> <li>Referrals:<ul> <li>A111(2) The Refugee Appeal Division may make the referral described in paragraph (1)(c) only if it is of the opinion that<ul> <li>(a)\u202fthe decision of the Refugee Protection Division is wrong in law, in fact or in mixed law and fact; and</li> <li>(b)\u202fit cannot make a decision under paragraph 111(1)(a) or (b) without hearing evidence that was presented to the Refugee Protection Division.</li> </ul> </li> <li>In Huruglica v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FCA 93 at para 70, the Federal Court of Appeal said that the power to send a case back to the RPD applied to cases where the RPD enjoys a \u201cmeaningful advantage\u201d over the RAD.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Case law and the use of policy instruments <ul> <li>Thamotharem v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2007 FCA 198<ul> <li>having the RPD member, or (at the time) RPO, question the claimant first did not violated the principles of procedural fairness</li> <li>the evidence did not show that Guideline 7 was unlawfully fettering RPD members\u2019 discretion.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 1126<ul> <li>The decision involved a challenge to jurisprudential guides identified by the Chairperson as providing guidance on certain questions of fact or mixed fact and law that arose frequently with respect to claims from four different countries.</li> <li>the Chairperson of the IRB was empowered by paragraph 159(1)(h) of the IRPA to issue jurisprudential guides addressed issues of fact: YES</li> <li>whether the jurisprudential guides unlawfully fettered members of the RPD and RAD: NO</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Application to Change in the Date and Time of a Proceeding <ul> <li>reading requirements:<ul> <li>IRB, Chairperson Guideline 6: Scheduling and Changing the Date or Time of a Proceeding (December 15, 2012)</li> <li>RPD Rules, rules 49-52, rule 54</li> </ul> </li> <li>New Medical Certificate Form for Refugee Claimants before the Refugee Protection Division (RPD)</li> </ul>","tags":["ICL860","Notes","Quizzes"]},{"location":"immigration/860/ICL860week2/#quizzes","title":"Quizzes","text":"Making a Claim in Canada <ol> <li> <p>If an officer has not made a decision on eligibility, the Refugee Protection Division can determine a claimant's eligibility on its own and proceed to hear the claim.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False <p>IRPA, s 100(3) states that the \"Refugee Protection Division may not consider a claim until it is referred by the officer.\"</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Which of the following claimant(s) may be ineligible to be referred to the Refugee Protection Division?

Please see a sample Basis of Claim narrative here. </li> <li>First, tell me a bit about yourself. <ul> <li>I am Francisco Ram\u00edrez L\u00f3pez. I am 66 years old. I was born on June 1, 1955, in Irapuato. Irapuato is in the state of Guanajuato, Mexico. I am a citizen of Mexico. \u2026 I am sorry. I am a bit nervous. I don\u2019t know why. What do you want to know? </li> </ul> </li> <li>Maybe tell me about your family. <ul> <li>I have a son and a daughter. I had another daughter, Elizabeth Ram\u00edrez Hern\u00e1ndez. She died in 2004, hit by a car. I think the car may have been driven by her ex-boyfriend, a police officer. It was terrible, but despite our suspicions, the police would not investigate. She spent three days in the hospital and then died of her wounds. \u2026 I think \u2026 I think of her every day \u2026 My son \u2026 my son does not live in Irapuato. He has moved to Loreto, which is in Baja California. He works in a restaurant there. It is hard to go to visit him, because of the shop, but he comes and visits us from time to time. He is not married, which I wonder about. \u2026. My other daughter, Alejandra Ram\u00edrez Hern\u00e1ndez, still lives in Irapuato and works in my shop with my wife and I. She has lived with us, too, ever since her divorce. She has a son and daughter, who sometimes live with her, sometimes with her husband. \u2026  </li> </ul> </li> <li>Ok. Good. We can firm up the details later. Tell me about your life in Irapuato.  <ul> <li>I own a motor parts shop in Irapuato. The shop is called La Bodeguita Moto Partes Y Accessorios, a motor parts shop, in Irapuato, in the state of Guanajuato, Mexico. I run the shop with my wife and my eldest daughter, who has lived with us since divorcing her husband, as I said. We also have two employees, although in the past we\u2019ve had 4 or 5. Lately business has not been as good, because of the amount of extortion. About 20 years ago, I would have to had to pay only about 100 pesos per month in extortion money. Now, I regularly pay about 5000 pesos per month.   </li> </ul> </li> <li>To whom do you pay extortion?  <ul> <li>I don\u2019t remember who I was paying 20 years ago. It may have been Los Zetas. More recently the money has gone the Cartel Santa Rosa de Lima. I wish I didn\u2019t have to pay, but extortion is just the cost of doing business. The police cannot protect us, so we have to pay. Going to the police is not possible. Or it is a waste of time. \u2026 </li> </ul> </li> <li>OK. Now, can you tell me a bit about why you have come to Canada now to seek refugee protection? <ul> <li>Although I have been extorted for years, my real troubles began in 2019. \u2026 I was attacked by members of the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Genera\u00e7ion. They told me they were looking for my sister and wanted me to tell them where to find her. There were three or four of them. One of them twisted my arm behind my back while another pointed a gun at me, and another asked me where my sister was. When I said I did not know, I was hit and kicked. The man holding my arm twisted it so hard it broke. I collapsed on the ground. They went away. \u2026  My younger sister, Mar\u00eda Ram\u00edrez L\u00f3pez, belongs to the local police. I have always loved Mar\u00eda de Jesus. I was 14 when she was born. When she was a child, she would follow me around like I was a God. I hope that does not sound arrogant. Maybe it is. But it\u2019s what it was like. She would hang around with me every day after school, watching me as I worked on cars in the local neighbourhood. I\u2019ve always loved cars, fixing them, taking them apart and putting them back together. \u2026 I was worried about Mar\u00eda de Jesus when, after high school, she decided to go into the police. But by then she was a fierce young woman who believed in keeping the people in our city safe. \u2026 I have only grown more worried about her as the city became more dangerous. But she has continued to work with integrity, even after marrying and having a child. To the extent it is possible, she did her job well. I am proud of her. \u2026  </li> </ul> </li> <li>Are you ok? Would you like to take a break? <ul> <li>No. It\u2019s fine. </li> </ul> </li> <li>Ok. Can you tell me why you think you might have been attacked? <ul> <li>In 2018 or maybe 2017 \u2026 I\u2019m not sure \u2026 the members of one Cartel, the Santa Rosa de Lima, murdered the nephew of the leader of another cartel. The other cartel was the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Genera\u00e7ion. Their leader is El Mencho \u2013 a terrible man. For years there has been fighting between the two cartels in Guanajuato, our state. Nueva Genera\u00e7ion wants to take over the drug business and the theft of oil \u2013 there are, you know, pipelines running through the state \u2013, but Santa Rosa is not backing down. The two cartels fight, and lots of innocent people and police officers lose their lives. This is one of the reasons I worry for my sister. \u2026 She had a run-in with Nueva Genera\u00e7ion at around April or May 2019. \u2026 That is, members of the Santa Rosa had murdered El Mencho\u2019s nephew in a coffeeshop in January 2017. The police took it very seriously. My sister told me they were taking the murder very seriously. In Mexico, a lot of murders get treated like nothing, but this one was treated like something because \u2013 well \u2013 no one wanted to imagine how bad things could get if the issue was not settled by the police. Even more people dying. \u2026 I think the police took it seriously because they did not want violence between the SLRC and CJNG to spin even further out of control. \u2026 My sister was not on the investigation, but the police were not solving it. Finally, her boss decided to use more officers to investigate the murder of the nephew. So my sister joined the investigation. Her partner too. \u2026 Of course, she wanted to help. But this was also the beginning of her trouble. \u2026 That\u2019s because the Cartel Jalisco had grown impatient \u2013 even more impatient. I think they had not been able to find El Marro. That\u2019s the head of the Santa Rosa de Lima.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>Sorry. The Jalisco had not been able to find El Marro? <ul> <li>Yes \u2026 That\u2019s right. Cartel Jalisco had not been able to find El Marro, so they thought they might have more luck by squeezing the police. \u2026 They would go to the officers working on the investigation and try to get them to tell them what they knew. They would accuse them of being corrupt. Threaten them, you know. Of working for the Santa Rosa de Lima. Of taking bribes, you know, to make the investigation go nowhere. \u2026 It makes some sense, but I know my sister would not take bribes. She has never taken bribes. You just have to look at her, at her house, at the way she lives. She never takes vacations. She does not have a car. She rides a, what do you call it, a scooter. No. She does not take bribes. \u2026 But the investigation continued to go nowhere. Cartel Jalisco members accused my sister and some of her colleagues of being in the Santa Rosa\u2019s pocket. They threatened them with death if they did not tell them where to find their chief. But my sister refused. \u2026 I think her other colleagues refused too. \u2026 At least that\u2019s what I think because the Jalisco attacked and killed two officers on the investigation. That may have been in April, May, or June 2019. I\u2019m not sure. \u2026 But after that happened, my sister went into hiding. Of course, she did. And they attacked me and broke my arm and said they would be back in a week \u2026  </li> </ul> </li> <li>Can you tell me what you did after they attacked you? <ul> <li>My wife and I went to the Centro Medico, where they did an x-ray and gave me a cast. \u2026 We spent the next day trying to decide what to do. I couldn\u2019t reach my sister, so I didn\u2019t know what to do. I wanted to leave with my wife and daughter. I said it was not worth keeping the business going. I am old anyway. But they wanted to stay. My wife said she could not start over in a new place. My daughter said she would stay with her mother to look after her. Besides she had her children, who she could not leave \u2026 Our discussions of what to do went on in circles for days and days. I stayed hidden in home, lying in bed, afraid. We sometimes yelled. My wife cried. \u2026 Then, one week later, one of our employees from the shop said that someone had slipped a note into our mailbox. It said \u201cTu hermana o tu vida \u2013 El Mencho.\u201d You know. Do you speak Spanish? </li> </ul> </li> <li>No. <ul> <li>Your sister or your life, signed El Mencho, the head of the Nueva Genera\u00e7ion. When I saw the note, I began to shake, like this. \u2026 I called my wife to tell her. She said, \u201cWell, Francisco, now you have to go.\u201d I agreed with her. We cried together on the phone. \u2026 I made arrangements quickly so the shop could be run by my wife and daughter. Then I packed my things. I drove me to the airport in Mexico City the next day with my daughter. I was terrified the whole way, for both of us. \u2026 Then she left me at the airport, and I went to the ticket desk. I couldn\u2019t get a ticket I could afford for two days, so I hid out in the sleep pods in the airport. They are these pods, like mini-hotels, where you can sleep. They are called Izzzleep. Spelled I-z-z-z-l-e-e-p. I only went outside to buy food. I was scared the Nueva Genera\u00e7ion would come find me. Maybe that did not make sense. I don\u2019t know. I was very confused. The Nueva Genera\u00e7ion are very dangerous, and they are everywhere. \u2026 They even attacked the police chief in Mexico City. \u2026 When I finally boarded the plane, I felt so relieved. Ever since then I have been living with my cousin in Toronto. </li> </ul> </li> <li>Ok thank you. I suggest that we stop for today. Thank you for telling me your story. What I will do is go over what you\u2019ve told me, prepare an outline, and then we will go over it together in more detail.</li> </ul> Onus and Identity <ul> <li>it is well-established that the person making the claim for refugee protection bears the onus of establishing all the elements of the claim. The RPD or RAD cannot rely solely on the arguments provided by the claimant.</li> <li>Typically, the claimant will do so with a mixture of claimant-specific evidence as well as more generic documentary evidence concerning conditions in their country of origin.</li> <li>It is important to note here that there is a difference between the evidentiary onus for each required element and the legal test that must be satisfied.</li> <li>Mmono v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration),\u202f2013 FC 219\u200b<ul> <li>[13] The Board is not required to make a claimant\u2019s case or advance a grounds for a claim that an applicant did not contend.</li> <li>[14] However, the Court of Appeal did require the Board to consider evidence that obviously emerged from the evidence.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Generic documentary evidence may be submitted by the claimant or may come from the National Documentation Package, or NDP, that is maintained by the IRB for all countries.</li> <li>the NDP for the claimant\u2019s country or countries of origin are considered part of the record before the RPD and the RAD in any claim. The claimant needs to familiarize themselves with the documents in the NDP that might support or challenge their claim.</li> <li>when a claim is rejected because of credibility concerns, the Federal Court reviews the RPD or RAD\u2019s findings on an extremely deferential basis, since credibility is said to lie within the \u201cheartland\u201d of their discretion. (See Siad v. Canada (Secretary of State), [1997] 1 FC 608 (CA), cited most recently in Ahmed v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2021 FC 351 at para 26.)</li> <li>since 1980, it has been accepted that the statements of a refugee protection claimant are presumed true. This presumption was stated expressly in the Federal Court of Appeal decision in Maldonado \u202fv. \u202fCanada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1980] 2 \u202fF.C.\u202f302 (C.A.), at 305:<ul> <li>When [a claimant] swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are true unless there be reason to doubt their truthfulness.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Negative credibility findings rebutting the presumption of truthfulness may be based on:<ul> <li>Contradictions, inconsistencies, omissions</li> <li>Implausibilities</li> <li>Silence of the documentary evidence</li> <li>Incoherent or vague testimony, level of knowledge</li> <li>Alteration or fabrication of documents</li> <li>Lack of identity or other documents</li> </ul> </li> <li>the UNHCR Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status (at paragraph 196) states that refugee claimant\u2019s should be given the benefit of the doubt in seeking to establish their claim:<ul> <li>196 It is a general legal principle that the burden of proof lies on the person submitting a claim. Often, however, an applicant may not be able to support his statements by documentary or other proof, and cases in which an applicant can provide evidence of all his statements will be the exception rather than the rule. \u2026 Even such independent research may not, however, always be successful and there may be statements that are not susceptible of proof.\u202f In such cases, if the applicant's account appears credible, he should, unless there are good reasons to the contrary, be given the benefit of the doubt.</li> </ul> </li> <li>A majority of the Supreme Court cited this passage approvingly in Chan v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [1995] 3 SCR 593 at para 142.<ul> <li>The benefit of the doubt should, however,\u202fonly be given when all available evidence has been obtained and checked\u202fand when the examiner is satisfied as to the applicant's general credibility.\u202f The applicant's statements must be coherent and plausible, and\u202fmust not run counter to generally known facts.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Identity and Rejection of Claim. Senghor v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 1041:<ul> <li>[16] A claimant who cannot establish their identity will not be granted refugee protection. It has been consistently held in this Court that failure to establish identity is fatal (Najam v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration),\u202f2004\u202fFC\u202f425;\u202f Rahal v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration),\u202f2012 \u202fFC \u202f319). The most frequently quoted passage comes from \u202fYang v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration),\u202f2009 FC 681, where Justice\u202f Snider wrote at paragraph \u202f6:<ul> <li>As I read the jurisprudence, the law is clear that, where identity is not established it is unnecessary to further analyze the evidence and the claims (Li v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FC 296\u202fat para.\u202f8;\u202f Husein v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 1998 CanLII 18842). However, when making identity findings, the Board must arrive at its conclusions based upon the totality of the evidence relevant to identity before it.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>A sample decision rejecting a claim due to lack of identity establishment. </li> </ul> Identity and Credibility <ul> <li>Identity Scenario: The claimant alleges to be a citizen of Sri Lanka. The claimant alleges that he entered Canada on a false document, which was taken by the agent. The claimant has provided no identity documents except for an illegible document purporting to be a Birth Certificate. It is a copy of a copy. The claimant has not made any attempt to obtain any identity documents from Sri Lanka. Identify:<ul> <li>A. Challenges the claimant might face establishing their identity and/or credibility. </li> <li>B. Questions a member of the Refugee Protection Division might raise. </li> <li>C. Strategies for addressing those questions.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Answers:<ul> <li>A.  1) The fact that the claimant entered Canada using a false document may show that they might have access to other false documents; 2) The fact that the claimant entered Canada using a false document may be taken as an indication that they are willing to use false documents to advance their claim; 3) The birth certificate as described does not seem to match Sri Lankan birth certificates as described in Document 3.1 of the Sri Lanka NDP (LKA200299.E); 4) Document 3.1 of the Sri Lanka NDP (LKA200299.E) indicates that document fraud, including with respect to birth certificates, is common in Sri Lanka; 5) Failure to make efforts to obtain other identity documents may be taken into account in assessing the claimant\u2019s credibility, under IRPA s 106.</li> <li>B. The RPD is likely to ask the claimant about where he obtained the false document and why he did not have or travel on an authentic passport. The RPD is also likely to ask the claimant about the provenance of the birth certificate; why it does not match the description of birth certificate from Document 3.1 in the NDP; and likely why he does not have a birth certificate matching the description of genuine birth certificates. Finally, the RPD is likely to ask the claimant what efforts he has made to obtain other identity documents.</li> <li>C. You and your client should brainstorm about what efforts you might make to obtain genuine identity documents. For instance, you might see if family or friends in Sri Lanka could send identity documents. Alternatively, you might see if the client could apply for identity documents from the Sri Lankan embassy without putting himself at further risk. For instance, Document 3.1 in the Sri Lanka NDP indicates that the Consulate General of Sri Lanka in Toronto has the authority to issue temporary travel documents.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Alienage and Country of Reference <ul> <li>The following readings treat the first of these requirements \u2013 that a claimant be outside each of their countries of citizenship or, if they are stateless, outside their countries of former habitual residence. This is sometimes referred to as the alienage requirement:<ul> <li>Tretsetsang v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FCA 175</li> <li>IRB, Interpretation of the Convention Refugee Definition in the Case Law (March 31, 2019) chapter 2.</li> </ul> </li> <li>If the claimant has a country of nationality, the claim should be assessed only against that country and not against some other country where the claimant may have residency status. If a claimant is a national of more than one country, the claimant must show that they are a Convention refugee with respect to all such countries.</li> <li>Where citizenship in another country is available, a claimant is expected to make attempts to acquire it and will be denied refugee status if it is shown that it is within their power to acquire that other citizenship. Consequently, a person who is able to obtain citizenship in another country by complying with mere formalities is not entitled to avail themself of protection in Canada.</li> <li>A consideration of former habitual residence is only relevant where the claimant is stateless. A stateless person is someone who is not recognized by any country as a citizen.</li> <li>The Court of Appeal in Thabet at 33 and 39, in the context of discussing whether a stateless claimant who has more than one country of former habitual residence must establish the claim with respect to one, some or all of the countries, had this to say about the issue of state protection:<ul> <li>\u2026 The definition takes into account the inherent difference between those persons who are nationals of a state, and therefore are owed protection, and those persons who are stateless and without recourse to state protection. Because of this distinction one cannot treat the two groups identically, even though one should seek to be as consistent as possible. (At 33.)</li> <li>\u2026 If it is likely that a person would be able to return to a country of former habitual residence where he or she would be safe from persecution, that person is not a refugee. This means that the claimant would bear the burden \u2026 of showing on the balance of probabilities that he or she is unable or unwilling to return to any country of former habitual residence.

On the one hand, you might conclude that the claimant has rebutted the presumption of state protection. The documentary evidence shows that protection is inadequate. While the Ukrainian government has announced an Action Plan and pursued other initiatives to protect LGBT people, the evidence shows that those actions have yet to translate into operational results (Zalzali). On the other hand, taking a contextual approach to the issue (Gonzalez Torres), you might conclude that, given that the claimant is a lesbian and not a gay man (who are the only victims of crimes noted in a survey of court cases), the progress made by Ukrainian authorities is adequate in the circumstances. While the protection is imperfect, there are real improvements \u2013 including guidelines on investigating hate crimes, a newly-formed patrol police that is earning the trust of the LGBT community in the Ukraine, and a national police leadership willing to work with LGBT groups to make further changes.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Case study on Rebutting the Presumption of State Protection<ul> <li>Q1: The claimant alleges that she is a Convention refugee because her former boyfriend threatened to kill her when she refused to marry him. According to the claimant, she did not go to the police because she believed they were collaborating with her former boyfriend. The claimant asserts that her belief that the police were working with the agent of persecution is a sufficient explanation for her failure to seek police protection. Is the claimant's assertion accurate? Yes or no? Why?<ul> <li>No. As noted in chapter 6 of the IRB\u2019s guide to the Interpretation of the Convention Refugee Definition in the Case Law (March 31, 2019), \u201cThe issue of state protection goes to the objective portion of the test of fear of persecution and it is not enough to simply assert a subjective belief that protection is not available.\u201d The IRB cites several cases to this effect. If the RPD makes no adverse credibility finding, the issue is one of the weight of the claimant\u2019s evidence: on its own, her asserted belief is unlikely to qualify as \u201cclear and convincing evidence\u201d sufficient to displace the presumption of state protection. If the RPD makes an adverse credibility finding, then the assertion would likely be accorded even less weight.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Q2: The claimant, a Sunni Muslim, was beaten in the street by a group of young Shia Muslims just outside the local police station. No one came to the claimant's aid despite his repeated calls for help. The claimant went to the police station and told them everything. The policeman, a Shia Muslim to whom the claimant told the story, said that he saw nothing and heard nothing. The claimant believed that the policeman knew the perpetrators well, sympathized with them, and did not want to help the claimant. The claimant asserts that the failure of the police to provide him with protection is sufficient to demonstrate the state's inability to adequately provide protection. Is the claimant's assertion accurate? Yes or no? Why?<ul> <li>Likely not. The claimant bears the onus of rebutting the presumption of state protection by showing that it is more likely than not that he will not receive adequate (not perfect) state protection. To rebut the presumption, he must take \u201call reasonable steps in the circumstances\u201d (see section 6.1.7.1 of chapter 6 of IRB, Interpretation of the Convention Refugee Definition in the Case Law (March 31, 2019)). Here it is unlikely that, without more evidence, the claimant should be found to have taken all reasonable steps. For instance, could the claimant have approached another policeman? Obviously, in such an assessment, the country condition evidence will be important. If that evidence, for example, shows that the police are predominantly Shia and that they discriminate against Sunnis, then the claimant\u2019s assertion should be given more weight. However, no such facts are given here.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Case study on IFA<ul> <li>Q1: Mr. Bakkabulindi is a citizen of Uganda. He alleges persecution based on his sexual orientation. When he lived in Kampala, he was discovered by the police in a car with another man in a compromising situation. The police extorted him. Is there a viable IFA in Mbale? <ul> <li>Likely not. The two-part test for establishing an IFA requires: (1) a finding on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the IFA; (2) a finding that conditions in the proposed IFA are not such that it would be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, for the claimant to seek refuge there (Rasaratnam; Thirunavukkarasu; see also IRB, Interpretation of the Convention Refugee Definition in the Case Law (March 31, 2019), chapter 8, section 8.1.)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Q2: Ms. Chernyavskaya is a citizen of Russia. She alleges domestic abuse by her husband. Her husband is a farmer in lrbit, which is about 2000 km from Moscow. Is there a viable IFA in Moscow? <ul> <li>Likely yes, although it depends. The two-part test for establishing an IFA requires: (1) a finding on a balance of probabilities that there is no serious possibility of the claimant being persecuted in the IFA; (2) a finding that conditions in the proposed IFA are not such that it would be unreasonable, in all the circumstances, for the claimant to seek refuge there (Rasaratnam; Thirunavukkarasu; see also IRB, Interpretation of the Convention Refugee Definition in the Case Law (March 31, 2019), chapter 8, section 8.1.) </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Section 96 or 97?<ul> <li>Q1: The claimant is a citizen of Pakistan whose father, a policeman, was involved in the war on terrorism and arrested members of criminal and terrorist groups.  The claimant's father testified at their trial.  The claimant's father was the victim of an attempt on his life and his family members' lives were threatened.  The claimant argues that, as a family member, he fears persecution by reason of his membership in a particular social group. Does this fall under s. 96 or s. 97?  Or do you need more information to make this determination? <ul> <li>Section 96. \u201cFamily\u201d may be considered a particular social group, but \u201cfor a derivative claim based on family membership to succeed, the family member who is the principal target of the persecution must be subject to persecution for a Convention reason.\u201d (See IRB, Interpretation of the Convention Refugee Definition in the Case Law (March 31, 2019) chapter 4, section 4.5, fn. 44.) Here, then, whether the claimant falls within a particular social group depends on whether his father belongs to a particular social group. It seems that the father may belong to a \u201cgroup associated by a former voluntary status, unalterable due to its historical permanence\u201d \u2013 the third category of particular social groups mentioned in Ward. Indeed, the IRB\u2019s handbook on the Convention refugee definition refers to a finding by the Federal Court that \u201cthe children of police officers who are anti-terrorist supporters\u201d can count as a particular social group (see IRB, Interpretation of the Convention Refugee Definition in the Case Law (March 31, 2019) chapter 4, section 4.5, item 12, citing Badran v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1996] FCJ No 437.)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Q2: The claimant's wife was found to be a Convention refugee on the basis of the domestic violence she experienced at the hands of her ex-boyfriend. The claimant alleged that the ex-boyfriend, a member of a notorious criminal gang, had threatened him because of his relationship with his wife. Does this fall under s. 96 or s. 97?  Or do you need more information to make this determination? <ul> <li>Section 96. The Federal Court has recognized the particular social group of \u201cmen who become victims of abuse at the hands of former abusive partners of their spouse because of that relationship with their spouse\u201d (see IRB, Interpretation of the Convention Refugee Definition in the Case Law (March 31, 2019) chapter 4, section 4.5, item 7, citing Sebok v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2012 FC 1107). This is an instance of a case where family membership gives rise to a nexus because of membership in a particular social group. Note that the claimant\u2019s nexus depends on the fact that the wife has an independent nexus, as a victim of domestic abuse.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Torture?<ul> <li>Q1: Mr. Singh is a citizen of India. He alleges he was beaten by the Punjab state police detained him for 5 days. They suspended him from the ceiling and hit him with belts. They wanted to know the whereabouts of his father, who is suspected to be a terrorist. Is this torture? Is there a nexus? <ul> <li>There is no nexus. The claimant was targeted because his father was an alleged terrorist. \u201cAlleged terrorist\u201d is not a \u201cparticular social group.\u201d Because the father is not being targeted for a Convention ground, the claimant\u2019s family relationship does not fall within the \u201cparticular social group\u201d ground either.  That is, \u201cfamily\u201d may be considered a particular social group, but \u201cfor a derivative claim based on family membership to succeed, the family member who is the principal target of the persecution must be subject to persecution for a Convention reason.\u201d (See IRB, Interpretation of the Convention Refugee Definition in the Case Law (March 31, 2019) chapter 4, section 4.5, fn. 44.) However, this is torture. There was severe pain or suffering was intentionally inflicted by public officials to obtain information. See the Schedule to the IRPA for the definition of torture. In this case, then, if the claimant continues to face a danger of torture on a balance of probabilities, his claim under IRPA, s 97 may succeed.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Q2: Mr. Salei is a citizen of Russia. This year, the police raided his apartment complex and arrested a number of individuals belonging to a drug trafficking organization. The police also arrested Mr. Salei. They imprisoned him for three days and abused him, asking him if he was a drug trafficker. Later, he was released and then picked up again two months later. He was released and told that he would be watched for criminal activity. ls this torture? ls there a nexus? <ul> <li>There is no nexus. Mr. Salei is being targeted by police because of his apparent connections to a drug trafficking organization. That does not fall under any Convention ground. It is unclear if the case involved torture. Torture requires severe pain or suffering that is mental or physical. We need more facts about the \u201cabuse\u201d to know whether the definition of torture was met.<ul> <li>There is no nexus.

In Portillo, Justice Gleason wrote that the analysis to determine if the generalized risk exception in IRPA, s 97(1)(b)(ii) applies must follow two steps: <ul> <li>First, appropriately characterize the risk faced by the claimant \u2013 including whether there is a future risk, what the risk is, whether the risk is one to his life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment, and the basis for the risk (see para. 40). </li> <li>Second, compare the correctly-described risk faced by the claimant to that faced by a significant group in the country to determine if the risks are of the same nature and degree (see para. 41). </li> <li>In this case, Mr. Pappa faces a future risk to his life because he refused to transport drugs across an international border for a criminal organization, the Perrones. The documentary evidence in the NDP speaks of the danger presented by gangs such as the Barrio 18, as well as the crimes committed by the Perrones (see various documents in section 7 of the NDP for El Salvador). However, threats of death due to recruitment into smuggling by the Perrones does not appear to be a widespread phenomenon \u2013 and thus not a risk faced by a significant group in the country. It is unmentioned (that we have found) in the documentary evidence in the NDP. Indeed, on the facts, Mr. Pappa appears to have been singled out because of the proximity of his home to the border with Honduras, as well as his dual citizenship.  </li> </ul> </li> </ul>","tags":["ICL860","Notes","Quizzes"]},{"location":"immigration/860/ICL860week4/#quizzes","title":"Quizzes","text":"Nexus, with a Focus on Membership in a Particular Social Group, Political Opinion <ol> <li> <p>A refugee claimant has previously belonged to a terrorist group.

His religion does not require public worship or other public manifestations of belief (including forms of dress). Hiram could therefore continue to practice his religion without publicly revealing it. Which of the following statements best characterizes the nature of her claim? Choose one. </p> <ul> <li> Hiram does not face a well-founded fear of persecution since he can practice his religion without revealing it. </li> <li> Hiram faces a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of his religion even his religion remains unknown. </li> <li> Hiram faces a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of his religion because there is a reasonable chance it may become known.</li> <li> We do not have enough facts to answer this question.  <p>What is needed are facts about how likely it is that Hiram's religious affiliation might become known even though he need not reveal it. Otherwise, the facts do not reveal any persecution of Hiram; in particular, because his faith requires no public worship or other manifestations, he is not being asked to conceal it. </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The Court in Klinko v Canada, [2000] 3 FC 327 (CA) held that to establish a nexus based on political opinion, it is sufficient that the state or machinery of state \"may be engaged\" in the issue that is the subject of the opinion. </p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Patricia comes from the country of Phionia where criminality, including rape, is widespread. The police are largely ineffective. There is no question that Patricia is at risk.

It therefore concludes that Jan has not rebutted the presumption of state protection. Based on these facts, which statement below best characterizes the RPD's decision? </p> <ul> <li> The decision is likely correct because the standard of protection is not perfection.</li> <li> The decision is likely in error because it considered only government's efforts to provide protection without inquiring into whether its efforts had achieved operational adequacy. </li> <li> The decision is likely in correct because to go beyond the inquiry into serious efforts would shift the burden onto the RPD to prove adequate state protection.

This includes clients, but also counsel and other witnesses.</li> <li>Requests for accommodations must be made in accordance with the relevant Rules of the Division. You can request a case conference prior to the hearing to discuss the specifics of an accommodation. </li> <li>The Guideline also provides guidance to Members to avoid reliance on myths, stereotypes, and incorrect assumptions relating to vulnerabilities, disabilities, and/or personal characteristics in their decision-making process. When you observe that the Member or the opposing counsel is relying on these myths, stereotypes and incorrect assumptions in their questioning, you may object to their questions on the basis that they are not adhering to this Guideline.</li> <li>Trauma-informed adjudication principles. Members must:<ul> <li>lead the proceeding with sensitivity to help prevent re-traumatization through the\u202fIRB\u202fdecision-making process; </li> <li>anticipate the possibility that trauma may impact a person's memory and ability to provide testimony and </li> <li>create a safe adjudicative environment for all participants to facilitate the giving of testimony. </li> </ul> </li> </ul> Designated Representatives, Accessibility, and Related Situations <ul> <li>A designated representative is a person who may make decisions and representations on behalf of a claimant who is younger than 18 or who is unable to appreciate the nature of the proceedings before the RPD or RAD.</li> <li>Designated representatives must be 18 or older, they must be able to understand the nature of the proceedings before the Refugee Protection Division, or RPD, and they must not have interests that conflict with the claimant\u2019s. Parents are usually the designated representative for their children.</li> <li>The Federal Court\u2019s decision in Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Patel, 2008 FC 747 discusses their role.<ul> <li>[38] The Court therefore finds that the Board is not unreasonable or incorrect when it fails to explicitly address the subjective fear of the minor child. It was open to the Board to infer the subjective fear of the minor child from the evidence presented, including the testimony of the child\u2019s designated representative who was speaking on his behalf.</li> <li>[45] The Court has constantly recognized that a tribunal is required to assess the cumulative impact of the hardships faced by the claimant. Therefore, even if none of the individual harms feared by the applicant are persecutory when viewed individually, the combined or cumulative effect of these harms may be persecutory. In this way, the cumulative effect of \u201cmerely\u201d discriminatory acts can amount to persecution. The tribunal is required to assess the circumstances of the claimant, including the claimant\u2019s age, when assessing whether or not the harm feared amounts to persecution.</li> <li>[58] The applicant submits that humanitarian and compassionate considerations have no place in the determination of whether or not a claimant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. And that the Board is required to make a determination on the basis of the factors set out in sections 96 and 97 of the Act. Any humanitarian and compassionate factors raised by a particular claimant, such as the best interests of the child, can only be fully considered once a determination is made on the issue of whether a claimant merits protection in Canada.</li> <li>[63] In addition, the Guidelines on Children Refugee Claimants clearly states that \u201crefugee children have different requirements from adult refugees when they are seeking refugee status\u201d. For instance, the Guidelines provide that in determining the procedure to follow when considering the refugee claim of a child, the Board should give primary consideration to the \u201cbest interests of the child\u201d. It also states that: \u201cthe \u2018best interests of the child\u2019 should be given primary consideration at all stages of the processing of these claims\u201d.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Principles for Evaluating Credibility <ul> <li>Three most important principles regarding credibility:<ul> <li>First, the principle from Maldonado that the evidence of a refugee protection claimant is to be presumed true unless there is a reason to doubt their truthfulness. This presumption may be rebutted. Examples of credibility concerns that may rebut the presumption of truthfulness are listed in Rahal and Magonza. They include contradictions or inconsistencies in the evidence, findings based on implausibility, and findings based on the demeanour of a claimant or witness.</li> <li>Second, fairness requires that any doubts about credibility must be put to a claimant in order for an adverse inference to be fair. The requirement of giving notice is discussed in the IRB\u2019s guide to Assessment of Credibility in Claims for Refugee Protection (December 31, 2020).</li> <li>Third, as stated in Rahal at paragraph 46, \u201cwhere a decision turns on credibility, it is incumbent on the RPD [or RAD] to provide reasons for its assessment given the importance of the issues at stake in a refugee claim.\u201d The RPD or RAD must explain why it has rejected a claimant\u2019s explanation or response to the concerns raised about credibility.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> From Theory to Practice: Designated Representatives, Accessibility, and Related Situations <ul> <li>Scenario 1: A local shelter has referred a client to you. She is a 15-year-old girl who crossed the border irregularly into Canada and made a claim for refugee protection. While young, she is exceptionally mature and clearly able to grasp the nature of her upcoming hearing before the Refugee Protection Division (RPD). She tells you that she has not secured representation and no one has been helping her with her claim. What steps should you take?<ul> <li>Subrule 20(1) of the Refugee Protection Division Rules states that \u201c[i]f counsel or if an officer believes that the Division should designate a representative for the claimant \u2026 because the claimant \u2026 is under 18 years of age \u2026 counsel or the officer must without delay notify the Division in writing.\u201d On the facts given, you do not know whether an officer notified the RPD that they believe it should name a representative for the claimant. Therefore, you should write the RPD write away to advise them of your belief that they must appoint a designated representative for her.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Scenario 2: Your client is an elderly man, about 84 years old, who was a victim of torture in his country of origin. You believe his age and trauma will significantly affect his ability to give coherent testimony about his experiences before the RPD. What steps should you take?<ul> <li>You should consider seeking procedural accommodations to ensure your client has a fair opportunity to present his case. To do so, you will need to make an application (see rule 50 of the RPD Rules; see paragraph 12 of Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 8). Such an application should be made as soon as possible (Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 8, paragraph 11). If possible, you should seek to support the claim with psychological evidence (Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 8, paragraph 13). </li> <li>As part of the application, you should request appropriate procedural accommodation. The specifics of what you should request will depend on your client. It may be that creating a more informal setting, varying the order of questioning will be sufficient, or asking for a support person to be present will suffice (see Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 8, paragraph 10). </li> </ul> </li> <li>Scenario 3: Your client is a woman from Iran. Her and her husband\u2019s claim was rejected by the RPD, where she was represented by other counsel. You asked to meet with them separately. While meeting with her to prepare her appeal, she tells you for the first time that prison guards raped her. The reason she did not reveal the rape earlier because her husband was with her during all her meetings with counsel, as well as at the RPD hearing. How might you bring the allegation of rape before the Refugee Appeal Division? <ul> <li>Your client might swear an affidavit or make a statutory declaration detailing her experience in the prison. You would then have to include that affidavit or statutory declaration as new evidence in the perfected appeal record and call the RAD\u2019s attention to it (see Refugee Appeal Division Rules, subrule 3(3)(d)(i) and (e)).</li> <li>You also need to include argument as to why this new evidence should be accepted (RAD Rules, subrule 3(3)(g)(iii)). Subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act states that a person who is the subject of an appeal may only present evidence that is \u201cnew\u201d, including evidence that the \u201cperson could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection.\u201d</li> <li>Here you may argue that due to the husband\u2019s presence during meetings with counsel and at the RPD hearing, in the circumstances your client could not reasonably have been expected to present evidence of her rape at the time of the rejection.</li> <li>In support, you may cite section D.1 of Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 4, on gender-based claims, which states: \u201cWomen from societies where the preservation of one's virginity or marital dignity is the cultural norm may be reluctant to disclose their experiences of sexual violence in order to keep their \"shame\" to themselves and not dishonour their family or community.\u201d </li> </ul> </li> <li>Scenario 4: Your client is making a claim based on their sexual orientation. During the hearing, the RPD member begins asking them about their sexual experiences since coming to Canada. When your client says they has not had any, the RPD member asks, \u201cWhy not? After all, there\u2019re no laws against homosexual behaviour here.\u201d Should you intervene?<ul> <li>You may want to intervene to remind them that it is inappropriate to rely on stereotypes when adjudicating claims based on sexual orientation and/or gender identity or expression (Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9, section 6).</li> <li>You may specifically want to bring their attention to the fact that it is a stereotype to think that \u201c[i]ndividuals with diverse\u202fSOGIE\u202fwould actively participate in\u202fLGBTIQ+\u202fculture in Canada, including frequenting\u202fLGBTIQ+-predominant areas and social establishments, or be involved in community organizations and groups.\u201d (Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 9, section 6, last bullet point) </li> </ul> </li> <li>Scenario 5: Before the RPD, a family of claimants included a father, his wife, and their 5-year-old child. The father was named the designated representative of the child. The RPD rejected the claim of the father and the child, but accepted the claim of the mother. The mother and father divorced in the days before the RPD released its decision. The mother was granted custody of the child. You are the RAD member. Should the father continue to serve as the designated representative for the child? <ul> <li>Recall that the RAD must act in the best interests of the child (Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 3, section I). The Guideline also contemplates situations where it is no longer appropriate for a designated representative to continue in that role (see section II).</li> <li>Subrule 23(1) of the RAD Rules states that if the RPD named a designated representative for a claimant, that person is deemed to have been designated by the RAD unless the RAD orders otherwise.</li> <li>Subrule 23(5) of the RAD Rules states that a designated representative must: be 18\u202fyears of age or older; understand the nature of the proceedings; be willing and able to act in the best interests of the person who is the subject of the appeal; and not have interests that conflict with those of the person who is the subject of the appeal.</li> <li>the RAD may wish to name an independent designated representative (i.e., neither the mother nor father) to act on the child\u2019s behalf.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> From Theory to Practice: Evaluating Credibility <ul> <li>Scenario 1 (Evidence): The claimant alleges a fear of his ex-wife\u2019s family, as well as of discrimination amounting to persecution against his ethnic group. In his Basis of Claim form and testimony, he said that after having been attacked by thugs in December 2018 and losing his job as an electrician because he was injured, he travelled from his home country to a neighbouring European country for work after obtaining a passport in May 2019. \u201cI lost my job and I \u2026 I knew that I cannot find job so probably I would go somewhere to find the work \u2026 That country is not far from mine, I would be working around 400 kilometres from us, so I could come home to \u2026 to visit.\u201d He visited home once more in September 2019. During his visit home he was attacked, and decided to come to Canada with his family to claim protection.<ul> <li>RPD\u2019s Finding: \u201c[34] The claimant alleges he was attacked in December 2018 so severely that he could not work for a time as an electrician, there being no workers\u2019 rights for members of his ethnic group. If the claimant was in fact injured in such an attack, his decision to obtain a passport so he could work in the neighbouring country is strange behaviour, inconsistent with a fear of persecution. I therefore draw an adverse credibility inference.\u201d </li> <li>Suggested Response: This credibility finding is based on the RPD\u2019s conclusion that the claimant\u2019s actions are inconsistent with his alleged fear of persecution; in other words, it is like a finding based on delay in leaving the country where he fears persecution. Therefore, as set out in Zeah, the RPD must assess whether the claimant has provided a satisfactory explanation to its concerns. Here the claimant provided such an explanation \u2013 that he needed to work, and wanted to work close to home. It might still be open to the RPD to find this explanation insufficient, but it must explain as much. </li> </ul> </li> <li>Scenario 2 (Evidence): The claimant is a member of an ethnic minority group with a sixth-grade education. He alleges that he faces discrimination amounting to persecution. In his Basis of Claim form he wrote that he was fired from his job in construction after he and some colleagues went on strike to protest the fact that they were paid less because of their ethnicity. The following testimony was given at the RPD hearing: (omitted)<ul> <li>RPD\u2019s Finding; \u201c[25] The claimant embellished the part of his story surrounding his job loss to enhance his claim. In his Basis of Claim form, he described the job loss as the result of a strike, whereas it appears no actual strike, as that word is normally understood, took place. The claimant was never fired, but left of his own volition when his manager refused to give in to his demands on the part of himself and a small group of disaffected fellow workers. This is hardly a case of not being able to find work. It is a case of being unhappy with the terms of the work that was available. I therefore draw an adverse credibility finding.\u201d</li> <li>Suggested Response: Rahal at para 43 states that contradictions that underpin a negative credibility finding must be real as opposed to illusory and that the RPD \u201ccannot seize on truly trivial or minute contradictions to reject a claim.\u201d Here, the supposed inconsistency between the \u201cstrike\u201d mentioned in the Basis of Claim form and the events recounted in the claimant\u2019s testimony seem to be trivial. They also seem to turn on a technical definition of the word strike that perhaps eludes the claimant, given his level of education. Further, the testimony given distinction does not support the RPD\u2019s finding that the claimant actually chose to leave his job. The claimant gave uncontradicted evidence about how firings took place at his workplace.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Scenario 3 (Evidence): The claimant is a young woman from Nigeria who claims protection based on her former membership in the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSB). In her Basis of Claim form and again in testimony, she said she had belonged to the group from 2005 to 2013. Further, the claimant provided a letter from a friend and secretary to the movement attesting to her membership. However, the documentary evidence in the National Documentation Package includes a statement from a lawyer with MASSB indicating that it does not provide letters to support asylum claims. In post-hearing submissions, the claimant provided a follow-up letter from her friend explaining that the lawyer\u2019s statement in the NDP does not reflect a consistent policy.<ul> <li>RPD\u2019s Finding: The RPD made no adverse credibility findings. Nonetheless it rejected the claim because it found the claimant had not established on a balance of probabilities that she had been a member of MASSB: \u201cI decline to give any weight to the letters provided by the claimant to prove her membership in MASSB. I have no evidence before me as to whether the author of the letter, whom the claimant admits is a friend, holds a position with the group. In the absence of such confirmation, I prefer the evidence found in the National Documentation Package, which is subject to quality assurance by the research directorate.\u201d </li> <li>Suggested Response: It is open to the RPD to prefer certain evidence to other contradictory evidence. In this case, you might nonetheless argue that the RPD\u2019s finding that the claimant is not a member of the MASSB is in effect an adverse credibility finding, since her testimony and evidence of membership is uncontradicted. By requiring corroborating evidence the RPD is in effect failing to follow the presumption of truthfulness from Maldonado. Indeed, in a case called Ahortor v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration) (1993), 21 Imm. L.R. (2d) 39 (F.C.T.D.), the Federal Court-Trial Division (as it was then) found that the corollary of the presumption of truthfulness from Maldonado is that if a claimant\u2019s account is uncontradicted and credible, there is no legal requirement to provide independent evidence to corroborate the claimant\u2019s sworn testimony. Further, as Evans Cameron notes in her book, the Court has found that the RPD should not find evidence to be unreliable simply because it comes from a friend of the claimant (see Evans Cameron, \u201cThe Wrong Mistake\u201d at pp 70-71.)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Scenario 4 (Evidence): The claimant alleges that she is claiming refugee protection in Canada because she does not want her daughter (a co-claimant) to be subjected to female genital mutilation in her home country. When asked why she could not find safety by moving to Big City, she said that her brother lived there. He was a lawyer working in the federal justice department. He would be able to track her down in Big City.<ul> <li>RPD\u2019s Finding: The RPD found that it was implausible that the claimant\u2019s brother, who is a lawyer, would help her family track her and her daughter down: \u201cI find it implausible that the claimant\u2019s well-educated brother would collaborate with his family members in order that FGM performed.\u201d</li> <li>Suggested Response: This seems like a case where the RPD has made an improper implausibility finding. In Rahal at paragraph 44, the Federal Court says that \u201ca finding of implausibility must be rational and must also be duly sensitive to cultural differences. It must also be clearly expressed and the basis for the finding must be apparent in the tribunal\u2019s reasons.\u201d In this case, the implausibility finding seems not to be sensitive to potential cultural differences. In particular, the RPD may not be taking into account that in the claimant\u2019s culture, education may not determine the stance an individual takes with respect to practices like female genital mutilation. Further, as Evans Cameron notes: \u201cUnderstanding across cultures is even more problematic when gender is added into the mix\u201d (see Evans Cameron, \u201cThe Wrong Mistake\u201d at pp 53.)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Scenario 5 (Evidence): The claimant alleges he was tortured and raped by prison guards in his home country, after having been arrested for his political activities. He has submitted a psychological report by Dr. Sigmund Freud. Dr. Freud\u2019s report recounts the fact that the claimant relayed to him. It then concludes that in his opinion, the claimant is suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome and that his symptoms are consistent with the story recounted. The report also indicates that the claimant\u2019s severe trauma made it difficult for him to recount the events he had experienced in a linear or consistent manner. Before the RPD, the claimant testified in ways that contradicted his Basis of Claim form in certain respects. His BOC said three guards were present during the rape, with two guards holding him down. At the hearing, however, he said that half-a-dozen guards were present. In his BOC, he said he was beaten with a cane every morning for a week. At the hearing, he said the beatings occurred only every other day, sometimes in the morning and sometimes in the afternoon. The RPD designated the claimant as a vulnerable person and allowed his counsel to take the lead in questioning him. <ul> <li>RPD\u2019s Finding: \u201cNotwithstanding the claimant\u2019s vulnerability and evident difficulty providing testimony, I am unable to find his allegations to be credible. Even keeping in mind the psychological report from Dr. Freud and the claimant\u2019s evident difficulty providing testimony, the discrepancies in the claimant\u2019s evidence are significant. I am unable to accept that the claimant would have trouble keeping track of whether three guards or six were present when he was raped. I am equally unable to accept that he would not be able to say whether he was beaten every day or every other day. It seems to me that each day\u2019s respite would be something that would stick in his mind during such a harrowing experience.\u201d</li> <li>Suggested Response: This may be a case where the RPD has misunderstood or downplayed the psychological report admitted into evidence (see Evans Cameron, \u201cThe Wrong Mistake\u201d at pp 45-46.) The RPD should have given more weight to Dr. Freud\u2019s evidence and less weight to its own expectations about what a claimant might be able to recall. It is also arguable that the RPD failed to apply Guideline 8 properly, in that the RPD failed to \u201c[t]o recognize that certain individuals face particular difficulties when they appear for their hearings or other IRB processes because their ability to present their cases is severely impaired.\u201d (Guideline 8, paragraph 3.1) </li> </ul> </li> </ul> From Theory to Practice: Trauma-Informed Interviewing <ul> <li>The author, Jill Taylor, lists five steps to ending the interview (See page 216). Test yourself. <ol> <li>Check in: Ask ask your client how they are feeling, and ask them how are they going to take care of themselves if the meeting was emotionally difficult or triggering.</li> <li>Ask for feedback: Ask your client what helped them during the interview process. Ask the what you could have done better.</li> <li>Provide resources if need be: Try to normalize the idea that everyone needs support.</li> <li>Provide contact information: Let them know how to reach you if they have questions, being clear about your availability and setting boundaries.</li> <li>Let them know what's next: Book the next appointment and let them know what to expect from you. </li> </ol> </li> <li>An Example Interview Closing<ul> <li>Rebecca: Shreya, you have done an incredible job today. I know you spoke about some really traumatic things. I just want to make sure you\u2019re going to be okay. What are your plans after this?</li> <li>Shreya: I think I need a nap; I feel really exhausted. Afterwards, my boyfriend is coming over and we\u2019re going to watch a movie.</li> <li>Rebecca: That sounds nice! I\u2019m glad you have someone supportive in your life. We\u2019re going to end here for today. How did you find the interview went? Is there anything you found particularly helpful? Or anything that didn\u2019t work for you? I promise you won\u2019t hurt my feelings, and it helps me to improve my interviewing technique.

What could have made it more convincing?</li> </ul> From Theory to Practice: Fairness and Natural Justice <ul> <li>fairness and natural justice can roughly be broken down into two overarching principles: <ul> <li>The right to be heard, which can lead to rights such as the right to notice, the right to be present at a hearing, the right to present evidence and make submissions, and the right to be represented, among others. </li> <li>The right to an impartial decision-maker, which translates into the right to have a decision-maker who is open-minded and is free of undue or untoward influence during the decision-making process. The test for reasonable apprehension of bias is What would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically \u2013 and having thought the matter through \u2013 conclude. Would he think that it is more likely than not that [the decision-maker], whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly. Committee for Justice and Liberty v. National Energy Board, 1976 CanLII 2 (SCC) at 394.  </li> </ul> </li> <li>Scenario 1: During a hearing, an RPD member repeatedly interrupts questions posed to the claimant by his counsel. For example, at one point counsel asked the claimant, \u201cWhat was your state of mind like at that period?\u201d The member interrupted and stated, \u201cI think we are losing, wasting time on state of mind. Let\u2019s go back, okay, please. We can cover that afterwards.\u201d At the end of the hearing the member asked counsel how long his submissions were going to be. Counsel replied about twenty minutes. The member responded that she needed to be out of there by 12 and could the submissions be given in writing. Counsel reluctantly agreed. Has there been a breach of natural justice or procedural fairness?  Yes, no, or it depends?<ul> <li>It depends. </li> <li>First, it depends on whether counsel was indeed allowed to go back and ask about the claimant\u2019s state of mind. </li> <li>Second, if not, it depends on how important that evidence was to the claim. For example, if the RPD rejects the claim based on delay in leaving the country of origin, and the questions about the claimant\u2019s state of mind would have nourished an explanation of the delay, then there may have been a breach of procedural fairness. </li> <li>Finally, it depends on whether requiring submissions in writing rather than orally was procedurally unfair for some reason. Here, there may be an argument that could be made based on the RPD\u2019s failure to follow the rules. RPD Rule 10(7) (which we read in Module 2) states that \u201c[r]epresentations must be made orally at the end of a hearing unless the Division orders otherwise.\u201d Here, the RPD ordered otherwise, but does not give reasons for the order. On the other hand, RPD Rule 71 states that \u201c[u]nless proceedings are declared invalid by the Division, a failure to follow any requirement of these Rules does not make the proceedings invalid.\u201d In other words, even if the RPD violated its own rules by not giving a good enough reason for declining to receive oral submissions, you would have to prove an independent breach of procedural fairness. It is not clear how being required to make submissions in writing leads to unfairness by violating the claimant\u2019s right to be heard.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Scenario 2: The member found that the claimant had never been attacked by skinheads based on a discrepancy between his testimony and his written narrative about the number of attacks. The member had said to the claimant during the hearing that he thought that this was only a slight discrepancy and that it would be unfair of him to make a finding based upon it. Has there been a breach of procedural fairness or a failure of natural justice? Yes, no or it depends?<ul> <li>Yes. A \u201clegitimate expectation\u201d refers to a procedural expectation that is created by a representation from someone in authority that is \u201cclear, unambiguous, and unqualified\u201d (Canada (Attorney General) v Mavi, 2011 SCC 30 at para 68). Such an expectation may be with respect to a procedure that will be followed. Alternately, an expectation may be with respect to a certain result. In the latter case, while there is no right to that result, there is an expectation of greater procedural fairness if the opposite result is reached. </li> <li>Here, the RPD member made a clear, unambiguous, and unqualified representation as to how they would treat a certain issue with respect to credibility. It was unfair to then make a finding on that issue without giving the claimant the right to offer further evidence, likely in the form of an explanation, or submissions. (For a discussion of legitimate expectations, see Nastasi et al. at 56-57.) </li> <li>In addition, a principle in the credibility case law is that important credibility concerns must be put to a claimant. This principle is expressed as follows in Jurado Barillas v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 825 at para 14:<ul> <li>I find that the RPD erred by not alerting the Principal Applicant to credibility concerns and allowing the Principal Applicant an opportunity to address these concerns. While the RPD is not required to put every deficiency to an applicant, when a deficiency is central to the RPD\u2019s determination, the RPD\u2019s failure to put the matter to an applicant may be a violation of procedural fairness \u2026 </li> </ul> </li> <li>Therefore, independently of the member\u2019s statement, there seems to have been a requirement of notice that the member considered the issue to be important. </li> </ul> </li> <li>Scenario 3: The claim was heard by a member who became ill after the hearing but prior to rendering a decision. The claimants were given the choice to have the matter heard anew by a new member or to have the new member make a decision based on the transcript of the hearing. Counsel for the claimants chose to have the new member make a decision based on the transcript of the hearing. The claimants also requested that they be provided with a transcript and allowed an opportunity to provide submissions prior to a decision being made. The RPD did not make a decision on this request. The transcript was not provided prior to the final decision being rendered. Has there been a breach of procedural fairness or a failure of natural justice?  Yes, no, or it depends?<ul> <li>It depends, but probably not. First, it depends on whether the claimant had made submissions orally at the end of the hearing. If not, the claimant was deprived of the right to make submissions and there has likely been a breach of procedural fairness. It also depends on whether or not the \u201crequest\u201d was made in the form of an application under RPD rule 49 and 50. If the request was not made in accordance with the rules, a failure to provide a decision would be less likely to be considered a breach of procedural fairness. Even if there were a formal application, however, it is unlikely that a breach of procedural fairness has occurred (so long as oral submissions were made). The claimant has had the right to present evidence and make submissions. The change in the decision-maker does not introduce any new burden or circumstance to which the claimant would be entitled to respond.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Scenario 4: The Member informs the Minister's counsel and the claimant's counsel that when they present their representations, they should take into account that the Member is very familiar with the country conditions and unless there is a very recent development, the Member is interested in hearing only claim-specific observations, which, in the Member's estimation, should not take more than 20 minutes. Has there been a breach of procedural fairness or a failure of natural justice?  Yes, no, or it depends?<ul> <li>No. RPD subrule 10(7) covers submissions; it states that counsel should be ready to give oral submissions at the end of a hearing. Paragraphs 5.8 and 5.9 of Chairperson\u2019s Guideline 7 cover the power of the RPD to place limits on representations:<ul> <li>5.8 Parties will have an opportunity to make representations at the hearing. The member will set time limits for the representations after all the evidence has been heard.

Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2020 FC 1063<ul> <li>This case discusses the obligation of the RAD to give notice to a claimant of when it plans to decide an appeal on an issue that was not treated by the RPD or raised in the claimant\u2019s memorandum of argument. Its focus is specifically on when the RAD must give notice that it plans to make a decision on a new credibility issue.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> From Theory to Practice: Appeals to the Refugee Appeal Division <ul> <li>Scenario 1: Your client claims refugee protection on the basis of having been pursued by Turkish authorities because she and her family are all members of the Hizmet movement, which was blamed for a coup attempt in July 2016. The RPD rejected her claim in a decision dated January 4, 2018. The RPD found the documentary evidence in the National Documentation Package did not support the claim that all persons associated with Hizmet are at risk. On appeal, the claimant submitted two pieces of evidence that were not before the RPD: (1) a letter from her father dated January 14, 2018 outlining the different ways Turkish authorities have gone after members of the family since the July 2016 coup; (2) a transcribed version of a positive decision (delivered orally on December 28, 2017) in an asylum claim made by her brother in the United Kingdom, in which the UK tribunal accepted that all members of the family were at risk. Is this new evidence admissible on appeal to the RAD? Be sure to consider the application of the relevant provisions of the Act, as well as the Singh decision.<ul> <li>Subsection 110(4) of the IRPA states that on appeal, a claimant may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim or that was not reasonably available, or that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection. The key date for determining the applicability of s 110(4) is the date of the RPD decision. In addition to being \u201cnew\u201d in the sense of complying with the express requirements of subsection 110(4), Singh confirms that the evidence must be credible, relevant and material.  </li> <li>The letter from the claimant\u2019s father is \u201cnew\u201d in the sense that it is dated after the RPD decision. However, it outlines information that would have been available to the claimant before the RPD\u2019s decision. There is no information given that indicates why the claimant would have been unable to obtain such a letter prior to the RPD\u2019s decision. Therefore, the letter is not \u201cnew\u201d in the sense required by IRPA, s 110(4), and therefore not admissible. </li> <li>The decision by the UK tribunal is dated prior to the RPD decision. However, the facts suggest that the decision was only rendered orally on December 28, 2017. It is unlikely \u2013 more facts are needed, but importantly a holiday intervened between the UK and RPD decisions \u2013 that a written version would have been released prior to January 4, 2018, the date of the RPD decision. In addition, the evidence is \u201ccredible\u201d because of its source, relevant because it tends toward proving the fact that the claimant is at risk, and it is material in the sense that \u201cit may have an impact on the RAD\u2019s overall assessment of the RPD\u2019s decision\u201d (see Singh at para 47). Therefore, it seems likely that the UK tribunal decision is admissible, subject to the proviso about the need for more facts about how long it took to get the written version of the decision. </li> </ul> </li> <li>Scenario 2: The RPD has rejected your client\u2019s claim on the basis that they have failed to rebut the presumption of adequate state protection. The RPD\u2019s decision was delivered orally. Its entire treatment of the state protection issue consists of two paragraphs outlining evidence of efforts made by the claimant\u2019s home country to provide protection and then a third paragraph where it states: \u201cI have taken into account all of the claimant\u2019s oral testimony and documentary evidence regarding her negligible attempts to seek state protection. In my view, the claimant\u2019s evidence falls far short of what is needed to rebut the presumption of state protection for an enlightened monarchy like Wakanda.\u201d The claimant had submitted two official records of complaints she had made to the Wakandan Police about being the object of reprisals by a member of the elite palace guard unit, the Dora Milaje. The receipts state that the claimant\u2019s complaint was the subject of \u201cfollow up.\u201d The claimant says, however, that nothing was done. Is it worthwhile trying to appeal the RPD\u2019s finding on state protection?<ul> <li>Yes. In Cepeda-Guttierez, the Federal Court states that a tribunal need not refer to every piece of evidence before it and that a statement that it had considered all the evidence would usually suffice (para 16). The Federal Court then says: \u201cHowever, the more important the evidence that is not mentioned specifically and analyzed in the agency\u2019s reasons, the more willing a court may be to infer from the silence that the agency made an erroneous finding of fact \u2018without regard to the evidence\u2019\u201d (para 17). In this case, the police receipts are important evidence with respect to the claimant\u2019s supposedly \u201cnegligible\u201d efforts to seek state protection. Therefore, the RPD may be found to have erred based on Cepeda-Guttierez.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Scenario 3: Hijda Morali claimed refugee protection on the basis of his sexual orientation. Homosexuality is illegal in his country of origin, and homosexuals are subject to significant discrimination and persecution. The RPD rejected his claim on the ground that it did not believe Mr. Morali was gay. After the rejection, Mr. Morali married another man at Victoria City Hall. He has submitted a marriage certificate, photographs of his wedding, as well as copies of Facebooks post announcing the wedding under a photograph of him kissing his new husband. The posts have been shared with friends and family in his home country. Mr. Morali has requested an oral hearing in his appeal record, in accordance with subparagraph 3(3)(d)(ii) of the RAD Rules. Should an oral hearing be held? Please explain.<ul> <li>IRPA, s 110(6) states an oral hearing may only be held by the RAD where there is new documentary evidence: that raises a serious issue with respect to the claimant\u2019s credibility; that is central to the decision with respect to the claim; and that, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the claim. </li> <li>Here, the central issue of the claim is Mr. Morali\u2019s sexual orientation and, perhaps more important, whether he is perceived as gay by potential agents of persecution in his home country. The documentary evidence establishes he married a man and that this has become known by family and friends in his home country. Whether or not the marriage is \u201cgenuine\u201d, knowledge of the marriage may be enough to put him at risk. Therefore, the RAD could bypass an oral hearing and overturn the RPD\u2019s decision. If it is contemplating dismissing the appeal, however, it should likely hold an oral hearing to test the genuineness of the marriage and whether it would likely be seen as genuine by the claimant\u2019s family and friends.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>","tags":["ICL860","Notes","Quizzes"]},{"location":"immigration/860/ICL860week7/#quizzes","title":"Quizzes","text":"The Refugee Protection Division Hearing <ol> <li> <p>If there is relevant information from another claim that the RPD wants to use for the current claimant, the RPD must obtain the other claimant's consent. </p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False <p>See Rule 21.

Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), (2004) 3 FC 195, 2004 FCA 49, Paragraphs 9-19, 46, 66-68<ul> <li>is a key case on procedural fairness in resettlement applications. In its decision, the Federal Court of Appeal applied the five Baker factors to determine that procedural fairness mandates that counsel should be allowed to attend resettlement interviews. In the analysis of those factors, we recommend you focus on the nature of the decision being made by the visa officer and the rights of counsel during the interview. Is the decision a predominantly legal one, or is it characterized by considerable discretion? What purposes may be served by having counsel attend the resettlement interview?</li> </ul> </li> <li>Helal\u202fv. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 37, Paragraphs 15-23<ul> <li>is a more recent case concerning procedural fairness in a resettlement application. The Federal Court found that \u2013 notwithstanding Ha \u2013 the procedural fairness owed to foreign nationals seeking entry to Canada is \u201cat the lower end of the spectrum\u201d (para 18). It goes on to consider whether there was a breach of procedural fairness in that case. Here we recommend asking yourself: What was the alleged breach of procedural fairness? What principle did the Court use to resolve the issue?</li> </ul> </li> <li>Anku\u202fv. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2021 FC 125<ul> <li>discusses several, cross-cutting errors in an officer\u2019s decision on a resettlement. This aspect of the decision is helpful for its break down of the nature of the decision that must be made by an officer. Later, the court zeroes in on the issue of whether or not the applicants\u2019 had a \u201cdurable solution\u201d and so failed to meet the requirements of IRPR, s 139(1)(d) (which requires that a foreign national must be \u201ca person in respect of which there is no reasonable prospect, within a reasonable period, of a durable solution in a country other than Canada\u201d). The court affirmed that an evaluation of whether there is a durable solution is \u201ca highly contextual exercise, driven by the facts\u201d (para 30). Here we recommend you consider comparing the court\u2019s discussion of this issue with the discussion of durable solutions in the IRCC operations manual.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Scenario 1: It is 2011. The principal applicant is a widow and citizen of Afghanistan. Her application includes her three adult sons, their wives and children (the principal applicant\u2019s grandchildren). The family left Afghanistan in 1993 after the Mujahadeen took over the country and the principal applicant\u2019s son was injured in an attack. They fled the country and have lived in a refugee camp in Pakistan since then. The applicants are from Kabul, which in 2011 was under government control and enjoyed relative stability. They do not have any family members in Afghanistan. Are the applicants members of either the Convention refugees abroad class or the Country of asylum class?<ul> <li>Likely not. To be a member of the Convention refugees abroad class, an applicant must \u201chave been determined, outside Canada, by an officer to be a Convention refugee\u201d (IRPR, s 145). However, the facts as described to do not disclose a fear of persecution for a Convention reason (recall the requirements from Module 3). To be a member of the Country of asylum class, an applicant must have been determined by an officer to be in need of resettlement because (a) they are outside all of their countries of nationality and habitual residence; and (b) they have been, and continue to be, seriously and personally affected by civil war, armed conflict or massive violation of human rights in each of those countries (IRPR, s 147). However, the relative stability of Kabul indicates that they do not continue to be seriously and personally affected by the civil war, armed conflict or human rights violations that plagued Afghanistan for so long.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Scenario 2: The principal applicant has lived in South Africa with refugee status for 14 years with his wife and their four children. All of them are citizens of Ethiopia. The principal applicant has been the victim of several burglaries, losing items such as a television set and 15,000 Rand stolen from a box under his sofa, as well as other items and amounts. The principal applicant has a business. His children are all entitled to attend public school. The principal applicant says that he and his family are the victims of discrimination, including at school. He says they are targeted by burglars also because they are foreigners. The principal applicant\u2019s first cousin and some other individuals sponsored his application. Does the principal applicant and his family have a durable solution in South Africa?<ul> <li>Likely yes. Note that there is no precise definition of \u201cdurable solution.\u201d Whether someone has a durable solution is a \u201chighly contextual exercise, driven by the facts\u201d (Anku, para 30). IRPR, s 139(d) refers to two types of durable solution \u2013 voluntary repatriation and resettlement. IRCC\u2019s operational instructions also refer to a third \u2013 local integration (presumably subsumed under \u201cresettlement\u201d). Here, local integration in South Africa is candidate durable solution. The instructions indicate that \u201c[l]ocal integration allows the refugee to live permanently in safety and dignity in the country of refuge and partake of its enduring legal, economic and social benefits.\u201d Determining whether local integration has or can occurred \u201crequires careful analysis \u2026 of both country conditions, the applicant\u2019s individual circumstances and a comparison of these circumstances\u201d to the instructions. Among the indicators of local integration are \u201clong-term residency\u201d and \u201caccess to participate in society.\u201d In this case, it is not clear whether the principal applicant and his family have access to long-term residency. The severity of the discrimination is not clear either. However, the principal applicant has a business, and his children have access to schooling. Unless their status is precarious (leading to a fear of refoulement) and the discrimination is serious, they likely at least have access to at least de facto local integration.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Scenario 3: The applicant is a citizen of Eritrea who was accepted as a refugee in Italy in 2015. In Italy, the applicant alleges she experiences discrimination, racism, and exploitation as a single female refugee. She works long hours (50+ hours a week) as a factory worker, facing harassment, verbal and physical abuse, and inappropriate touching. The applicant has three children who currently live in Ethiopia with an aunt. She says it would be easier to reunite with them and care for them in Canada because there she would have her sponsors\u2019 help. Her sponsors are a group of her relatives. Is the applicant entitled to a permanent resident visa because she is in need of refugee protection?<ul> <li>Likely not. The applicant\u2019s circumstances in Italy, while difficult, do not indicate that she does not have a durable solution there. However, Desloges &amp; Sawicki notes (at 513) that: \u201cIn the event of an ineligibility problem, section 25 of the IRPA affords officers the broad discretion to \u2018grant the foreign national permanent resident status\u2026\u2019\u201d Note that section 25 requires that the \u201cbest interests of a child directly affected\u201d be taken into account. In this case, the applicant could request that the officer take into account the best interests of her children, including their chances of reuniting with their mother and the increased support they would get from the applicant\u2019s relatives in Canada.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Cessation and Vacation <ul> <li>These are two ways that a person who has been granted refugee protection may lose their status as protected persons on application by the Minister.<ul> <li>Cessation applies when a person no longer needs protection.</li> <li>Vacation applies when a person obtained protection through fraudulent means.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Cessation can occur either because circumstances in a person\u2019s country of origin have changed or because the person has taken certain actions that indicate they are not at risk. Specifically, section 108 of the IRPA, applies when a person:<ul> <li>Has voluntarily \u201cre-availed\u201d themselves of the protection of their country of nationality;</li> <li>Has voluntarily reacquired their nationality;</li> <li>Has acquired a new nationality and enjoys the protection of the country of that nationality;</li> <li>Has voluntarily become re-established in the country that the person left or remained outside of and in respect of which the person claimed refugee protection in Canada; or</li> <li>The reasons for which the person sought refugee protection have ceased to exist.</li> </ul> </li> <li>the last ground for cessation does not apply under subsection 108(4) \u201cif there are compelling reasons arising out of previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment for refusing to avail themselves of the protection of the country which they left\u201d.</li> <li>If the Minister\u2019s application is accepted, the person\u2019s claim is deemed to have been rejected. If the person was a permanent resident, they will lose permanent resident status under paragraph 46(1)(c.1) of the IRPA (unless the application is allowed under paragraph 108(1)(e) for a change in circumstances) and will be deemed inadmissible under section 40.1.</li> <li>Nsende\u202fv. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2008 FC 531<ul> <li>Nsende addresses the interpretation of paragraph 108(1)(a) of the IRPA, cessation because of voluntary re-availment. As the IRB\u2019s guide indicates, paragraph 108(1)(a) is the most frequently invoked ground of cessation. In reading the case, you should ask yourself: What are the requirements for establishing re-availment? What role does intention play?</li> </ul> </li> <li>Vacation applies when a person is found to have obtained refugee protection fraudulently. subsection 109(1) of the IRPA states:<ul> <li>The Refugee Protection Division may, on application by the Minister, vacate a decision to allow a claim for refugee protection, if it finds that the decision was obtained as a result of directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter.</li> </ul> </li> <li>If the Minister\u2019s application is accepted, the decision that conferred protection is \u201cnullified\u201d under paragraph 109(3).<ul> <li>If they were a permanent resident, the person who is the subject of the decision loses that status under paragraph 46(1)(d) of the IRPA. A person whose status has been vacated will be deemed inadmissible under paragraph 40(1)(c) of the IRPA.</li> <li>Although citizenship is not covered in this course, a successful application for vacation can also lead to loss of citizenship under sections 10 and 10.1 of the Citizenship Act (R.S.C. 1985, c. C-29).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Coomaraswamy v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 FCA 153, Paragraphs 1-7, 9-30, 42<ul> <li>This is an important case that establishes many key principles for applying section 109. In reading this case, we suggest that you focus on the different ways a person might resist a vacation application and, in particular, what evidence they may rely on.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Mella\u202fv. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2019 FC 1587 (CanLII), 1-22, 26-42:\u202f<ul> <li>Mella is a recent case in which the Court dealt with a number of \u201cequitable\u201d challenges to a vacation application: duress, \u201cinnocence\u201d of misrepresentation, or abuse of process by the Minister (in this case, in the form of a delay of about 10 years) in bringing an application.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Cessation Scenario 1: Thelonious Musque was granted refugee protection in 1998, at the age of 14. Five years later, he applied and was accepted into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. After four years, he graduated summa cum laude with a degree in Artificially-Intelligent Reverse Micro-Financial Quantum Computing. Degree in hand, he moved to Silicon Valley and launched an immensely successful start-up, SockMate, which helps people find matching pairs of socks under their beds no matter how hung over they are. Not only has the company made billions, but Thelonious pushed his roommates out of the business. In just five years, he had become one of the world\u2019s most famous billionaires, sitting atop a fortune of some US$10 billion and dating New Zealand-born pop sensation Lorde. He obtained a U.S. green card and is in default of his residency obligations under IRPA, s 28. The Minister brought an application to cease his refugee protection, arguing that he can no longer be a protected person since he was no longer a Canadian permanent resident and because, if he ever gets into trouble, he can just hide out in New Zealand with Lorde, along with all his money and his unlost socks. Should the application be accepted under IRPA, s 108?<ul> <li>No. Despite his loss of permanent residence and his obtention of a US Green Card, none of the grounds for cessation apply. IRPA, s 108(1)(c) provides that a protected person\u2019s refugee protection may be ceased if they obtain nationality in a third country and enjoys the protection of that country. However, Musque only has US permanent residence and not US citizenship. Finally, s 108 does not allow for cessation in cases of extreme wealth or romantic attachment to a celebrity.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Cessation Scenario 2: Miss Molly was granted refugee protection in 2004, claiming a fear of the police in her country of origin. In 2009, 2010, and 2016 she travelled back to her country of origin. The Minister applied to have her refugee protection ceased. During the cessation hearing, she testified that she returned home in 2009 because her mother was diagnosed with a terminal illness, and then in 2010 when her mother died. Both times, she said, she went immediately to the family home and never went out other than for the funeral. In 2016, she testified that she returned home after the death of her father. This time, she said, she stayed with a sister and went out for the funeral. On another occasion, she went to a bar for a night out with friends and family that she had not seen for 12 years. She admits it was risky, but fortunately nothing happened. It was part of the grieving process, she said. Please set out an analysis of whether the Minister\u2019s application should be granted under IRPA, s 108(1)(a).<ul> <li>The courts have accepted that \u201cre-availment\u201d under IRPA, s 108(1)(a) requires three things:<ul> <li>(1) voluntariness: the re-availing act must be voluntary (and not coerced);</li> <li>(2) intention: the refugee must intend to re-avail of the protection of their country of origin;</li> <li>(3) re-availment: the refugee must actually obtain such protection.</li> </ul> </li> <li>In a case such as this one, much will turn on the RPD\u2019s evaluation of the credibility of Miss Molly\u2019s testimony and the weight afforded to it. Here, Miss Molly\u2019s return to her country of origin in 2009, 2010, and 2016 was voluntary. She testifies that she did not intend to re-avail herself of her country\u2019s protection. Finally, whether she actually obtained protection may be assessed using factors listed in the IRB,\u202fInterpretation of the Convention Refugee Definition in the Case Law\u202f(December 31, 2020)\u202fchapter 12, section 12.5.3.3:<ul> <li>\u201cuse of a passport to travel, the reason for the travel, whether or not the protected person took precautions, and the length of the visit are all factors that the RPD and the Courts have considered to answer the question of whether the protected person has actually reavailed.\u201d</li> </ul> </li> <li>Militating in favour of allowing the application are the fact that Miss Molly returned three times to her country of origin and that, on her third visit, she went out in public to a place where she might easily be seen. Militating against allowing the application is the fact that \u2013 apart from the outing to the bar \u2013 she essentially remained in hiding.</li> <li>On balance, when comparing this case to a decision like Din v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 425 (cited in the IRB\u2019s chapter), it seems like the application should be rejected.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Vacation Scenario 1: A\u2019s claim for refugee protection was accepted on the ground that she took part in marches against the government in her country, protesting its treatment of A\u2019s minority ethnic group. The Minister has brought an application to vacate the decision. The application was brought after an investigation into the consultant who represented A at her initial hearing before the RPD. The consultant was found to have manufactured fraudulent evidence in several claims, including A\u2019s. In particular, he had manufactured a police summons and court judgment relating to her alleged arrest at a protest march. A admits that she did not take part in the protest march. How would the vacation application have to be analyzed?<ul> <li>As stated in the IRB's\u202fInterpretation of the Convention Refugee Definition in the Case Law (December 31, 2020)\u202fchapter 13 at section 13.5.2, the analysis of an application to vacate a decision granting refugee protection involves two steps:<ul> <li>First, the RPD must find that the decision granting refugee protection was obtained as a result of a direct or indirect misrepresentation, or a withholding of material facts relating to a relevant matter; and\u202f</li> <li>Second, the RPD should consider whether there remains sufficient evidence that was considered at the time of the positive determination to justify refugee protection and, if so, the RPD may reject the application to vacate, notwithstanding the misrepresentation.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Here, it appears that refugee protection was granted principally on the basis of A\u2019s participation in anti-government protests. However, there is also some suggestion that the government might engage in the mistreatment of or discrimination against A\u2019s minority ethnic group. Accordingly, under the second step of the analysis, the RPD will have to analyze whether, merely as a member of her ethnic group, A falls under either section 96 or 97 of the IRPA.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Vacation Scenario 2: P is an accepted refugee claimant who crossed into Canada from the United States. Her claim was accepted based on her alleged fear of being targeted for rape and other reprisals in Honduras, her alleged country of citizenship. The RPD also considered evidence that she had been convicted in Florida of three counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor and sentenced to 30 years\u2019 imprisonment. It decided that she was not excluded under article 1F(b) because her actions would not have constituted a crime in Canada, due to the age of the minor (16) and the fact that P was not in a position of trust relative to him. (Under the Criminal Code, the age of consent is 16 unless the adult is in a position of trust, in which case the age of consent is 18.) On a vacation application, in which it proffers evidence that P is not in fact a citizen of Honduras but of the United States. Should the application be allowed?<ul> <li>Likely not. The RPD considered evidence relating to P\u2019s conviction under the heading of exclusion. However, that same evidence might establish that P is a person in need of protection under IRPA s 97(1)(b). That is, even though P is a citizen of the United States, it is arguable that the sentence of 30 years\u2019 imprisonment is \u201ccruel and unusual treatment or punishment\u201d applied \u201cin disregard of accepted international standards\u201d (see IRPA, s 97(1)(b)(iii)). If so, she would be a person in need of protection under IRPA, s 97. The crucial point here is to ask whether the sentence complies with international standards. If not, then the application should be rejected under IRPA, s 109(2). For a case that considered this issue, see X (Re), 2012 CanLII 95148 (CA IRB) and Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Harvey, 2013 FC 717.</li> </ul> </li> <li>In cessation analysis, rthree-part test for re-availment: the refugee must have<ul> <li>1) acted voluntarily;</li> <li>2) intended to re-avail himself of their country\u2019s protection; and</li> <li>3) actually obtained such protection.</li> </ul> </li> <li>If refugees acquire and travel on passports issued by their country of nationality to travel to that country or to third country, then there is a presumption that they have intended to avail themselves of protection of their country of nationality.</li> <li>However, this presumption is rebuttable. In determining whether the presumption of re-availment has been rebutted, the RPD must consider the factors set out in Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Galindo Camayo, 2022 FCA 50 (CanLII), at para 84: \"Thus, in dealing with cessation cases, the RPD should have regard to the following factors, at a minimum, which may assist in rebutting the presumption of re-availment. No individual factor will necessarily be dispositive, and all of the evidence relating to these factors should be considered and balanced in order to determine whether the actions of the individual are such that they have rebutted the presumption of re-availment.\"<ul> <li>The provisions of subsection 108(1) of IRPA, which operate as a constraint on the RPD in arriving at a reasonable decision: Vavilov SCC, above, at paragraphs 115\u2013124;</li> <li>The provisions of international conventions such as the Refugee Convention and guidelines such as the Refugee Handbook, as international law operates as an important constraint on administrative decision makers such as the RPD. Legislation is presumed to operate in conformity with Canada\u2019s international obligations, and the legislature is \u201cpresumed to comply with the values and principles of customary and conventional international law\u201d: Vavilov SCC, above, at paragraph 114, citing R. v. Hape, 2007 SCC 26, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 292, at paragraph 53; R. v. Appulonappa, 2015 SCC 59, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 754, at paragraph 40; see also IRPA, paragraph 3(3)(f).</li> <li>The severity of the consequences that a decision to cease refugee protection will have for the affected individual. Where the impact of a decision on an individual\u2019s rights and interests is severe, the reasons provided to that individual must reflect the stakes: Vavilov SCC, above, at paragraphs 133\u2013135;</li> <li>The submissions of the parties. The principles of justification and transparency require that an administrative decision maker\u2019s reasons meaningfully engage with the central issues and the concerns raised by the parties: Vavilov SCC, above, at paragraphs 127\u2013128;</li> <li>The state of the individual\u2019s knowledge with respect to the cessation provisions. Evidence that a person has returned to her country of origin in the full knowledge that it may put her refugee status in jeopardy may potentially have different significance than evidence that a person is unaware of the potential consequences of her actions;</li> <li>The personal attributes of the individual such as her age, education and level of sophistication;</li> <li>The identity of the agent of persecution. That is, does the individual fear the government of her country of nationality or does she claim to fear a non-state actor? Evidence that a person who claims to fear the government of her country of nationality nevertheless discloses her whereabouts to that same government by applying for a passport or entering the country may be interpreted differently than evidence with respect to individuals seeking passports who fear non-state actors. In this latter situation, applying for a passport or entering the country will not necessarily expose the individual to their agent of persecution. This may be especially so when all the individual has done is apply for a passport: applying for a passport may have little bearing on the risk faced by a victim of domestic violence, for example, or her level of subjective fear;</li> <li>Whether the obtaining of a passport from the country of origin is done voluntarily;</li> <li>Whether the individual actually used the passport for travel purposes. If so, was there travel to the individual\u2019s country of nationality or to third countries? Travel to the individual\u2019s country of nationality may, in some cases, be found to have a different significance than travel to a third country;</li> <li>What was the purpose of the travel? The RPD may consider travel to the country of nationality for a compelling reason such as the serious illness of a family member to have a different significance than travel to that same country for a more frivolous reason such as a vacation or a visit with friends;</li> <li>The frequency and duration of the travel;</li> <li>What the individual did while in the country in question;</li> <li>Whether the individual took any precautionary measures while she was in her country of nationality. Evidence that an individual took steps to conceal her return, such as remaining sequestered in a home or hotel throughout the visit or engaging private security while in the country of origin, may be viewed differently than evidence that the individual moved about freely and openly while in her country of nationality;</li> <li>Whether the actions of the individual demonstrate that she no longer has a subjective fear of persecution in the country of nationality such that surrogate protection may no longer be required; and</li> <li>Any other factors relevant to the question of whether the particular individual has rebutted the presumption of re-availment in a given case.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Rights of Protected Persons <ul> <li>IRCC,\u202fApplications for permanent residence: Protected persons\u202f(May 18, 2021).

As per s. 64(2) of the IRPA he has no right of appeal to the IAD. He may, however, seek leave for judicial review of the admissibility finding to the Federal Court.

Overall, H&amp;C applications allow foreign nationals who are inadmissible or ineligible to apply for permanent residence based on humanitarian and compassionate considerations and if successful allows the foreign national to stay in Canada. Although on its own, an H&amp;C application does not stay a removal proceeding, it may assist in obtaining a stay of removal from the Federal Court.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>If Yuri applies for a TRP, in order for the application to succeed, what must Yuri show?</p> <ul> <li> It is in the best interests of Yuri's children for Yuri to stay in Canada\u202f\u202f</li> <li> The benefit of having Yuri stay in Canada outweigh the risks</li> <li> There are compelling reasons for Yuri to be in Canada and these reasons outweigh the risks to the health and safety of Canadians</li> <li> Yuri has been rehabilitated and will not commit any more crimes <p>The issuance of a TRP is authorized by s. 24(1) of the IRPA. TRPs are a catchall when permanent admission is not viable. Such application involves a balancing between the health or risk to the Canadian public versus the need or reason for entry to Canada.

This is also reflected in IRCC\u2019s operational instructions on procedural fairness.</li> <li>To ensure that the applicant has a meaningful opportunity to participate, decision-makers must give sufficient notice about any process or interview that could result in a decision on their application and must give the applicant a reasonable opportunity to bring evidence or make arguments supporting their application. Decision-makers should tell applicants which documents may be required in order to address concerns. Sufficient information should be included on interview invitation letters to allow applicants to prepare. If any additional concerns arise from an interview, decision-makers should provide the applicant with an opportunity to address those concerns either at the interview or subsequent to the interview, through a procedural fairness letter.</li> <li>The right to be heard requires that an applicant be given a meaningful opportunity to take part in the process. This requirement also applies in regard to information received from third parties, including IRCC partners. While this does not mean that the decision-maker must provide the physical documents consulted during the decision-making process (El Maghraoui v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 883), there is a requirement that the essence of the decision-maker\u2019s concerns be communicated to the applicant (Krishnamoorthy v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2011 FC 1342) and that the applicant is advised of the specific provisions of the Act at issue. What is important is that the decision-maker\u2019s concerns are adequately communicated to the applicant, who must then be given a reasonable opportunity to respond.</li> <li>The purpose of procedural fairness letters is described in Bui v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 440:<ul> <li>[29]\u202fAn officer may put concerns to an applicant by way of a procedural fairness letter. Said letter must contain enough detail to enable the applicant to know the case to meet, meaning that the applicant is provided with a reasonable understanding of why the officer is inclined to deny the application (Bayramov v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration),\u202f2019 FC 256 at para\u202f15;\u202fEzemenari v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration),\u202f2012 FC 619\u202fat para\u202f11). In other words, an applicant should not be\u202f\u201ckept in the dark\u201d\u202fabout the information upon which an officer may render a decision (Chawla v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 434 at para\u202f19). </li> </ul> </li> <li>Sample Procedural Fairness Letters: </li> </ul>","tags":["ICL870","Notes","Quizzes"]},{"location":"immigration/870/ICL870week1/#quizzes","title":"Quizzes","text":"Chapter 1 of Sharma &amp; Daghighian <ol> <li> <p>Kayo is learning about the various stakeholders involved in Canada's immigration system.

order:</p> <ul> <li>(a) an officer directed the foreign national to return temporarily to the United States under section 41; and</li> <li>(b) the foreign national is inadmissible under paragraph 41(a) of the Act for failing to establish that they will leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay.</li> </ul> <ul> <li>IRCC officer generally writes a 44(1) report. But when it's about security, human rights issue, organized criminality, CBSA will manage the case.</li> <li>The federal court in Hernandez v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 429 concluded that the scope of discretion under ss 44(1) and (2) is broad to allow consideration of H&amp;C.</li> <li>Onus of Proof: at an admissibility hearing the onus of proof depends on whether the person concerned (PC) has legal status in Canada.<ul> <li>if the PC was denied the right to enter Canada, and therefore has no legal status, the onus is on the PC to prove they are not inadmissible</li> <li>if the PC was allowed to enter Canada and is alleged at a later time to have become inadmissible, then the onus is on the hearings officer to prove those allegations.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Standard of Proof: In most cases the standard is \"reasonable grounds to believe\". For section 36(1) of the IRPA, where the permanent residents or foreign nationals are alleged to have \"committed an act\" outside Canada, the standard is \"on a balance of probabilities\".</li> </ul> Arrest and Detention <ul> <li>At the POE, an officer may arrest and detain a PR or FN to ensure that the person will be available for examination (IRPA s 55(3)(a)), or the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person is inadmissible on any of the most serious grounds of inadmissibility. The officer must notify the ID so that a detention review can be held within 48 hours (IRPA s 57(1)).</li> <li>Wihtin Canada, generally an office is required to issue an immigration warrant for arrest and detention. Within 48 hours of a detention, an officer may review the reasons for the detention and may exercise their authority under s 56(1) of IRPA to release the person. Otherwise, the officer must notify the ID so a review hearing could be held. (IRPA s 55(4)).</li> <li>A person appearing at an admissibility hearing may be detained at the end of the hearing.</li> <li>Unless a FN can prove they have the appropriate visa, a FN who is part of a group that is designated irregular arrival will be designated and known as a DFN under s 20.1(2) of the IRPA and subject to automatic detention if they are 16 years of age or older. (s 56(2))</li> </ul> The Immigration Division <ul> <li>Admissibility hearings. The ID has the authority under s 45 of the IRPA to hear and decide whether PR and FN alleged to have contravened the IRPA should be allowed to enter or remain in Canada or should be ordered removed.</li> <li>Detention reviews. The ID has the authority under s 54 of the IRPA to review the reasons for the immigration detention of PR, FN, and DFN to decide whether to release them or whether there are sufficient reasons to continue the detention.</li> <li>Hearings before an ID member are quasi-judicial proceedings and are adversarial.</li> <li>Family members who are included in the inadmissibility report may be subject to the same removal order.</li> <li>the PC (person concerned) must be personally in attendance at the hearing.</li> <li>Generally, the hearing officer (CBSA) first calls the PC. There is no right against self-incrimination at an admissibility hearing.</li> <li>s 229(3) of the IRPR directs the ID to make a deportation order instead of the prescribed removal order against a person if the PC meets any of the following criteria:<ul> <li>previous subject to a removal order</li> <li>failed to comply with any conditions or obligations imposed under IRPA or legislation</li> <li>convicted in Canada</li> </ul> </li> <li>the ID member may make any of the following decisions (s 45 IRPA):<ul> <li>allow PC to enter Canada</li> <li>grant status to PC</li> <li>authorize PC to enter Canada for further examination</li> <li>make removal order</li> </ul> </li> <li>Counsel may make a oral request for written reasons at the end of the hearing or later, in writing, provided that the request is made within 10 days of the date of the decision. (Rule 7(4))</li> <li>The PC has no right to appeal to IAD if the inadmissibility is based on \"security, human rights violation, serious criminality or organized criminality.\" (s 64 IRPA)</li> <li>DFN has no right of appeal to the RAD.</li> <li>The detention review is initiated when the ID receives a request for a detention review from the minister. The issue of detention may also arise at the end of the inadmissibility hearing, after the member has issued a removal order, if the minister argues that there is a reason to place the PC in detention.</li> <li>There is no limit to the amount of time that a person may be in immigration detention as long as there is a periodic review.</li> <li>The Ontario Court of Appeal (Wang v Canada, 2018 ONCA 798 at 23, 33) has ruled that immigration detainees can apply for hebeas corpus to challenge their incarceration in situations that amount to \"indefinite detention\" under the Charter.</li> <li>The time for ID to review the reasons for a continued detention (A 57(1) &amp; (2)):<ul> <li>the initial review: 48 hours of detention</li> <li>the second review: 7 days of first detention</li> <li>subsequent review: 30 days following each of the previous review</li> </ul> </li> <li>A DFN under 16 years of age is excluded from the detention.</li> <li>Detention reviews for PR who are being held under a security certificate are conducted by the federal court, not the ID (A82). 48 hours for the initial review and 6 months following the previous review.</li> <li>Detention reviews before the ID are adversarial hearings.</li> <li>Factors to be considered if a PC should be detained (R 244):<ul> <li>flight risk</li> <li>danger to the public</li> <li>identity not established, and</li> <li>other factors (R248, 249)</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Removal <ul> <li>Canadian citizen are not subject to removal. The only situation in which a citizen may be removed from Canada is if their citizenship is first revoked. This may happen if the citizenship was granted on the basis of a misrepresentation.</li> <li>Family members of a foreign national who is the subject of a removal order may also be included within the order.</li> <li>The type of removal order made against a PC depends on which ground of inadmissibility are found to have been violated. <ul> <li>departure orders (R224): no authorization is necessary to return. 30 days to becomes enforceable. require a certificate of departure when leaving.</li> <li>exclusion orders (R225): a written authorization is necessary to return during ONE year. Misrepresentation is FIVE years. family member is exempt from period restriction.</li> <li>deportation orders (R226): always need an authorization to return. family member is exempt from period restriction. A80 certificate of security is deemed as a removal order and always need an authorization to return.</li> </ul> </li> <li>R224(2). If a person fails to leave Canada within the 30-day time period, or leaves and fails to obtain a certificate of departure, the departure order is automatically deemed to be a deportation order. </li> <li>R229. An exclusion order must be issued by the ID when a person is found to be inadmissible to Canada. The person must apply for an authorization to return within barred period. How to apply? and ARC op1: procedure</li> <li>Five ways a removal may be stayed:<ul> <li>by the minister</li> <li>by application for leave for a judicial review</li> <li>by application for PRRA</li> <li>by approval on H&amp;C grounds</li> <li>by appeal to IAD</li> </ul> </li> <li>Furthermore, if a statutory stay is unavailable, a person can apply to the federal court for a stay of removal pending further judicial review litigation.</li> <li>R230. the minister may not issue a stay of removal order if the person is inadmissible on security, violation of human rights, serious criminality and organized crimes, or a person that consented in writing to their removal. </li> </ul> Procedural Fairness and ID Rules <ul> <li>Cha v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2006 FCA 126<ul> <li>The trial Judge quashed this order, finding that the Minister\u2019s delegate had an obligation to consider the particular circumstances of the applicant and his conviction to determine if there were any mitigating circumstances which would make it unreasonable to deport him.</li> <li>the appeal should be allowed. Because subsection 44(2) applies to all grounds of inadmissibility, the scope of discretion may vary depending on the grounds alleged, on whether the person concerned is a permanent resident or a foreign national and on whether the report is referred or not to the Immigration Division.</li> <li>Parliament has made it clear that criminality of non\u2011citizens is a major concern. It is their [officer] respective responsibility, when they find a person to be inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality or criminality, to prepare a report and to act on it.</li> <li>A review of the five duty of fairness factors set out in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) led to the conclusion that the respondent was entitled to a relatively low degree of participatory rights.</li> <li>[42] five factors set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 1999 CanLII 699. </li> <li>[47] the fact is that he came to Canada under a student permit renewable, we were told, every six months, that he was permitted as a matter of privilege to stay in Canada for a certain duration and subject to certain conditions, never had and could never have had any expectation that he would be allowed to remain in Canada and has breached a major condition of his right of entry. This factor points to a lower duty of fairness.</li> <li>[48] Furthermore, even though the issue of inadmissibility has been determined, a foreign national can still seek a stay of the removal order on H&amp;C considerations (section 233 of the Regulations) or in the course of a pre\u2011removal risk assessment (section 232 of the Regulations). He is therefore not out of the country yet, and not out of remedies. This factor also points to a lower degree of fairness.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Case Study \"Bora Park\" <ul> <li>The wording of the offence at article 44 of the\u202fKorean Road Traffic Act\u202fdoes not require any particular blood alcohol level to be established for a conviction.\u202fSimilarly, in\u202fCanada, the offence of \u201cimpaired driving\u201d at\u202fCriminal Code paragraph 320.14(1) does not require any particular blood alcohol reading. As long as the evidence establishes a degree of impairment, ranging from slight to great, the offence is made out: R v Stellato,\u202f1993 CanLII 3375 (ON CA), affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada. </li> <li>In order for a foreign conviction to result in inadmissibility, it must first be found to be the equivalent of an offence in Canada.  Once the Canadian equivalent of the foreign offence has been identified, the Canadian equivalent must fall within the parameters of IRPA 36(2) to result in inadmissibility. </li> <li>For a PR, the punishable conviction must be 10-year maximum. For a FN, any minor conviction could lead to inadmissibility.</li> </ul>","tags":["ICL870","Notes","Quizzes"]},{"location":"immigration/870/ICL870week2/#quizzes","title":"Quizzes","text":"Module 2: Chapter 3, Parts I, II, and III of Sharma &amp; Daghighian <ol> <li> <p>Which of the following best describes admissibility proceedings before the Immigration Division? </p> <ul> <li> Admissibility proceedings are criminal in nature </li> <li> Admissibility proceedings determine the individual's immigration status in Canada</li> <li> Admissibility proceedings rule on a verdict of the offense and sentence the individual according to the circumstances of the offense </li> <li> The purpose of admissibility proceeding is to determine whether the individual is guilty or innocent of the offense  </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>The best way to describe a hearing before the Immigration Division is: </p> <ul> <li> Formal and inquisitorial </li> <li> Quasi-judicial and adversarial </li> <li> Adversarial akin to criminal proceedings </li> <li> Judicial and adversarial </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Juliet is an IRCC officer preparing a Section 44 report for an inadmissible individual.

Although it is available to foreign nationals who are inadmissible for subsection 36(1) serious criminality irrespective of their sentence, it is not available to those who are inadmissible under subsection 37(1) organized criminality.</li> <li>[10] Section 42.1 provides that the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness may declare that subsection 37(1) organized criminality does not constitute inadmissibility in respect of a foreign national if he or she is satisfied that this exception is not contrary to the national interest.</li> <li>[11] Before a removal order is enforced, a foreign national can apply for a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA) (sections 112\u2013113). </li> <li>[12] While section 48 of the Act directs that removal orders be enforced as soon as possible, the person concerned may request that it be deferred. CBSA retains a limited discretion to defer (see Lewis v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2017 FCA 130, [2018] 2 F.C.R. 229 (Lewis), at paragraph 54).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Solmaz, 2020 FCA 126 and note that charges not proved beyond a reasonable doubt can still be used to establish the necessary elements. See para 23 - there can be a finding of inadmissibility, notwithstanding an acquittal. <ul> <li>[23] Furthermore, the IAD notes that although the offence giving rise to the removal order is the only one for which the respondent has been convicted, this is not his only experience with the criminal justice system. In this regard, it identifies, based on police reports produced by the Minister, four incidents, occurring between June 2007 and April 2010, of domestic violence and intra-family conflicts involving the respondent\u2019s former in-laws. In one case, charges of assault were allegedly laid against the respondent, then withdrawn. In another, he was acquitted of charges of making death threats against his former spouse and members of her family. In the other two cases, he was not summoned to stand trial.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Representing your Client before the IAD in Review <ul> <li>Burden of proof on appellant<ul> <li>You are responsible for providing the relevant information to the Member</li> <li>It is not the Member\u2019s responsibility to ask for documents or ask questions about topics that you have failed to address</li> <li>You must prove your client\u2019s case on the required standard of proof: a balance of probabilities</li> </ul> </li> <li>Documentary evidence<ul> <li>The disclosure deadline is 20 days in advance of the hearing</li> <li>If your documents are late, explain why they are late and how they are relevant</li> <li>If the Minister\u2019s counsel objects to late documents, suggest a recess and/or adjournment</li> <li>Format of documents: 8.5/11 paper, pagination, indices, translations and translator\u2019s declaration</li> <li>Include a list of proposed witnesses in your cover letter: name, address, and telephone number</li> </ul> </li> <li>Disclosure documents in H and C<ul> <li>Tailor your evidence to the factors for consideration for your specific type of removal order appeal (e.g., H&amp;C)</li> <li>Address establishment (e.g., economic-, familial-, and community involvement)</li> <li>Example documents for establishment: job letters, Notice of Assessment as proof of tax payments, letters of support from friends and family</li> <li>Address hardship (for your client and their family)</li> <li>Example documents for hardship:<ul> <li>Letters of support from family in Canada</li> <li>Evidence of adverse conditions in the country of origin (e.g., economic conditions, gender issues, availability of mental health care, etc.)</li> <li>Best interests of a child (e.g., birth certificates, photos, school documents)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Don\u2019t take anything for granted.

He received a 12-month conditional sentence consisting of house arrest.  On March 31, 2018 the Immigration Division determined that your client is inadmissible to Canada as he is a person described in IRPA paragraph 36(1)(a) and issued a Deportation Order against the appellant.

It involves the state holding non-citizens (foreign nationals and permanent residents) in custody. Detainees can be held in custody in jails (even where they have never committed a crime) and immigration holding centres.</li> <li>The Immigration Division holds hearings, called \u201cdetention reviews\u201d, at regularly prescribed intervals where the Minister must show that detention continues to be required.</li> <li>two parts of the analysis that occur in every detention review: <ul> <li>Step 1: is there a ground for detention (IRPA 55, 58; IRPR 245-247; other factors)? </li> <li>Step 2: if so, is detention justified (s. 248 IRPR)?   </li> </ul> </li> <li>While the Immigration Division does have authority to detain an individual under s. 58(2) of the Act, in almost all circumstances it is a CBSA officer who first detains a person for immigration purposes.  Section 55(1) of the Act sets out the grounds on which a CBSA officer can issue a warrant for the arrest and detention of any non-citizen - including permanent residents. </li> <li>Section 55(2) sets out the grounds on which a foreign national (other than a protected person) can be detained without a warrant.These grounds do not apply to permanent residents of Canada.</li> <li>CBSA officers also have the ability to detain any non-citizen upon their arrival into Canada (either by land or by air).  These grounds are set out in s. 55(3) of the IRPA. At subsection 55(3) of the Act, we see the power of arrest for examination or investigation, which applies to all non-citizens equally, including to permanent residents and protected persons. This arrest power is often referred to as the \u201cMinisterial inquiry\u201d ground of detention. </li> <li>The Minister also has authority under s. 20.1 of the IRPA to designate groups of persons arriving in Canada as \u201cdesignated foreign nationals\u201d. This provision covers situations where an officer believes that there has been human smuggling or where the officer cannot conduct an examination of a group of people (e.g., for identity/admissibility) in a timely manner. In these circumstances, an officer can designate the group to be \u201cdesignated foreign nationals\u201d. One consequence of this designation, stipulated at ss. 55(3.1) and 56(2) of the IRPA is mandatory detention.</li> </ul> Scenarios for Release <ul> <li>Once a person is arrested and detained under section 55 of the Act, there are two potential scenarios for release: <ul> <li>Release by a CBSA Officer.  Subsection 56(1) of the Act provides that, within the first 48 hours, the detainee can be released by an Officer (i.e., by the CBSA), who can also impose any conditions of release deemed necessary.  Although it is less common, counsel may be called upon by a client (especially if it is an existing client) to assist with release negotiations with a CBSA officer right after their client has been detained.  In such circumstances, you would want to discuss with the CBSA officer why the person\u2019s detention should not be continued and/or put together a release plan if possible and negotiate release terms and conditions.  </li> <li>Release by the Immigration Division.  Subsection 56(1) also provides that once the Immigration Division holds its first detention review, which must occur within the first 48 hours of detention, it is then only the Immigration Division that can order release or continued detention.  This is the stage where counsel most often gets involved and will be the focus of the rest of this module.   </li> </ul> </li> <li>The Minister bears the burden of establishing on a balance of probabilities that detention should be continued.  In practice, this is a two-step process.  <ul> <li>First, the Minister must demonstrate that at least one of the enumerated grounds under s. 58 has been established.  Indeed, s. 58 mandates that the Division must order release of a person unless it is satisfied that at least one of the enumerated grounds for detention has been made out. </li> <li>Once the Minister establishes a ground for detention, the Division must then assess each of the factors set out in s. 248 of the Regulations (referred to as \u201cthe s. 248 factors\u201d). In most instances a detained person will be released pursuant to this part of the analysis, not because the Division finds that a ground for detention does not exist.   </li> </ul> </li> </ul> Step 1: Is there a ground of detention? <ul> <li>Subsection 58(1) of the Act sets out the four grounds on which the Division can maintain a person\u2019s detention.</li> <li>Regulation s. 245 provides factors for assessing a non-citizen\u2019s flight risk. Section 246 provides factors for assessing danger to the public. And s. 247 provides factors for assessing identity.</li> <li>Danger to public<ul> <li>A danger opinion. A danger opinion written against them for being a danger to the security of Canada under either s. 101(2)(b); 113(d)(i) or (ii) or section 115(2)(a) or (b) of the Act.  It is important for counsel to raise relevant considerations such as the age of the opinion, and any rehabilitation or other material changes that have occurred since the opinion was issued or any other factors that weren\u2019t taken into consideration in the opinion.</li> <li>Association with a criminal organization. However, counsel can work to mitigate any potential association by setting out whether:<ul> <li>that association was dated </li> <li>the individual took steps to leave the association</li> <li>the individual took any rehabilitative steps </li> <li>the association was at a low level. </li> </ul> </li> <li>People smuggling or trafficking in persons. It is important to put any potential smuggling activities into context (for example, did the person concerned assist in a smuggling endeavor to help themselves escape to safety?). </li> <li>Previous criminal convictions for specified offences. The factors include convictions inside or outside Canada or pending charges outside of Canada for sexual offences, offences involving violence or weapons, many drug offences including trafficking, importing/exporting and producing a prohibited substance under the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act or the Cannabis Act. The Minister often relies on a much broader range of criminal convictions to ground their assertion that a person is a danger to the public. Case law is clear that a conviction alone is not enough to ground a danger finding. The Division must also assess factors surrounding a conviction</li> </ul> </li> <li>Flight Risk the Division will look at whether the Minister has established on a balance of probabilities that the person will not show up for either a proceeding (like an admissibility hearing or Minister\u2019s Delegate Review) or, more often, for their removal from Canada. This is by far the most common ground of detention that comes before the Immigration Division.<ul> <li>Whether the person is a fugitive from justice from another jurisdiction. As counsel it\u2019s important to make sure that any offence they are alleged to have committed is an offence in Canada as well, and that the Minister provides evidence that they are actually a fugitive. </li> <li>Whether a person has voluntarily complied with any: previous departure orders, required appearances at an immigration or criminal proceeding, conditions imposed with respect to their entry into Canada, their release from immigration or criminal custody, and conditions imposed along with any stay of removal. </li> <li>Whether the person has, or has attempted to, avoid an examination or escape from custody. </li> <li>Whether the person has been involved in smuggling or trafficking of persons or is vulnerable to being influenced or coerced by an organization involved in such an operation such that they are likely not to appear. </li> <li>Whether the person demonstrates strong ties to a community in Canada. </li> </ul> </li> <li>Identity There are three parts to this assessment.<ul> <li>First, the Minister has to establish that they are of the opinion that the identity of a foreign national has not been and may be established.</li> <li>Second, the Minister must demonstrate that the person\u2019s identity may be established.  That is, that there are steps that can be taken either by the Minister or the person concerned that could result in the person\u2019s identity being established. </li> <li>Finally, the Minister must demonstrate that either the person concerned is not cooperating by providing the Minister with relevant information or that the Minister is making reasonable efforts to establish their identity.</li> <li>Regulation 247 sets out the factors that must be assessed when the Division is assessing whether the identity ground has been set out.</li> <li>Whether they have taken steps to obtain evidence of their identity</li> <li>Whether the person is a refugee claimant and whether they or the Minister can obtain identity documents without divulging their personal information to government officials in their home country </li> <li>Whether the foreign national destroyed their identity or travel document or used false identity documents to mislead CBSA officials  </li> <li>Whether the information that the person concerned has provided is reliable</li> <li>there are many places from where it is impossible to have identity documents, and in such cases, secondary identity evidence should suffice. See: <ul> <li>Warsame v. Canada (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship), 2019 FC 118</li> <li>Sow v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 295</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Ministerial Inquiry The Ministerial Inquiry ground is the least common ground of detention (besides detention on the basis of being a designated foreign national). The Minister must demonstrate that they have a reasonable suspicion that the person is inadmissible on one of the enumerated grounds (security s. 34, violating international human rights s. 35, criminality (s. 36) or organized criminality (s.37)). Typically, the Minister just has to give a reason for their suspicion. Once the Minister has demonstrated a reasonable suspicion, the assessment turns to whether or not the Minister is taking the necessary steps to investigate the inadmissibility. </li> </ul> Step 2: Is detention justified? <ul> <li>If the Immigration Division finds that there is at least one ground of detention under s. 58 of the IRPA, it must still decide whether detention is actually justified. It does this by considering each of the factors set out in s. 248 of the Regulations.  </li> <li>The factors set out in\u202fIRPR\u202fsubsections 248(a)-(e) were inserted following a 1994 Federal Court judgment called\u202fSahin, in which the Federal Court held that these are among the factors that must be considered in order for a detention to remain consistent with section 7 of the Charter. </li> <li>the list of s. 248 factors is mandatory (i.e. every factor in s. 248 must be considered by the Member), but it is not exhaustive.</li> <li>s. 248 factors explained</li> <li>(a) reasons for detention<ul> <li>This factor always weighs in favour of detention, it just depends how much.  When assessing the weight to be given to this factor, the Member must assess which ground they are detaining on as well as the severity of that ground.</li> </ul> </li> <li>(b) Length of time in detention<ul> <li>As the length of a person\u2019s detention increases it will quickly start to weigh in favour of release.</li> </ul> </li> <li>(c) Anticipated length of time in detention<ul> <li>An assessment of this factor can take into consideration a variety of factors, but typically looks at how long it is going to be before the procedure or proceeding that the person is being detained for will occur. Simple estimates, not backed by any evidence, should be called into question by counsel, especially as the length of a person\u2019s detention increases.  If a person\u2019s probable length of detention cannot be determined on an ongoing basis, enforcement of a removal order may become illusory, in which case the person should be released.</li> </ul> </li> <li>(d) Unexplained delays or lack of diligence<ul> <li>This factor can weigh for or against detention.  If the person concerned is not cooperating or is responsible for delay, it can weigh in favour of their detention.  If, however, the Minister is responsible for the delay or has not diligently done what they were supposed to do (for example in investigating a person\u2019s identity), then this factor can weigh in favour of release. </li> </ul> </li> <li>(e) Alternatives to detention<ul> <li>This factor requires the Member to look at potential alternatives to a person\u2019s detention to determine if they offset the risks created by the grounds of detention.</li> </ul> </li> <li>(f) Best interests of a directly affected child<ul> <li>Typically, this will be the person\u2019s children, though it can also be a person\u2019s grandchild, niece or nephew even a neighbour or friend\u2019s child. </li> <li>There are specific sub-factors that have to be considered by the Member when determining how much weight to accord to this factor. These are outlined in Regulation 248.1(1) and include: <ul> <li>the child\u2019s physical, emotional and psychological well-being; </li> <li>their healthcare and educational needs; </li> <li>the importance of maintaining relationships and the stability of a family environment; </li> <li>the care protection and safety needs of the child; </li> <li>and the child\u2019s view and preferences depending on their ability to provide them. </li> </ul> </li> <li>Evidence include a statement from the child if they are able to provide one, medical and psychiatric documentation and letters from friends/family/schools etc. </li> </ul> </li> </ul>","tags":["ICL870","Notes","Quizzes"]},{"location":"immigration/870/ICL870week5/#quizzes","title":"Quizzes","text":"Module 5: Grounds and Factors for Detention <ol> <li> <p>Will the FN be detained under the IRPA?</p> <ul> <li> Yes</li> <li> No</li> <li> Whether or not she is detained is at the discretion of the CBSA</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>What are the possible ground(s) for the FN's detention?

The CBSA must disclose all of the relevant information, and not just facts that they are relying on in their argument for detention (see Guideline 2 at 7.3.4).</li> <li>This expanded scope of disclosure was clarified by the Federal Court of Appeal in\u202fBrown v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2020 FCA 130 (CanLII) at para 142, where the Court stated,<ul> <li>The need for detainees to know the case against them creates a disclosure obligation. To be meaningful, the disclosure obligation cannot be limited to information on which the Minister intends to rely. All relevant information must be disclosed, including information that is only to the advantage of the detainee.</li> </ul> </li> <li>When you are retained by your client after the 48-hour detention review it is important that you reach out to get all previous disclosures from CBSA as well as any other relevant evidence they have in their possession.  If you are retained prior to the 48-hour review, you will want to ensure that you get the Minister\u2019s disclosure before the hearing. If you do not receive sufficient disclosure, you can go to the hearing and argue that the Minister has not met his burden to continue detention.</li> <li>write a sample letter to CBSA. For the accessible and downloadable version of this letter, click here.</li> </ul> Putting Together a Release Plan <ul> <li>Start from the position that release should be granted as soon as possible and with the least onerous conditions available, in keeping with the guidance of the Supreme Court of Canada in\u202fR v Antic, 2017 SCC 27 at para 29,<ul> <li>The ladder principle generally requires that a justice not order a more onerous form of release unless the Crown shows why a less onerous form is inappropriate.</li> </ul> </li> <li>If the issue is just flight risk, you will want a plan that addresses and mitigates the reasons that the detainee has missed past appointments, or CBSA\u2019s belief that they might go underground if ordered deported based on what they fear in their home country. This is best remedied by a bondsperson taking responsibility for ensuring they comply with the release plan.\u202f</li> <li>If the ground for detention is that your client is a danger to the public, you may need a more detailed release plan that would mitigate any risk such as counselling or addictions treatment. Frequently, mental health or addiction issues are present in these cases. You may want to find and reach out to a community agency who can provide support and whose programming your client agrees to attend. Some other possible plans that could reduce the risk of \"danger\" are more frequent voice or email reporting to CBSA, living with a specific close friend or relative, a curfew, not communicating with certain individuals who have led to problems in the past, or ankle monitoring.</li> <li>A longer list of potential release conditions can be found in Guideline 2 at 3.2.2.</li> </ul> Finding a Bondsperson <ul> <li>At the centre of most release plans is the bondsperson. This is a person who has agreed to vouch for the detainee with a deposit of money (called a \u201ccash bond\") or a guarantee to pay an amount of money if a detainee is released and does not follow the agreed upon conditions (called a \u201cperformance bond\u201d).</li> <li>The following are important requirements that must be satisfied when putting forward a bondsperson.<ul> <li>PR and Residence: In order to put up a performance bond, the Bondsperson must be a citizen or permanent resident of Canada who is over 18 years old.</li> <li>Responsibility and Influence: The bondsperson must know the person in detention and be willing and able to take responsibility to ensure that the person concerned will comply with conditions of release. The strongest bondsperson is someone who is close enough to be able to exert influence on the detainee but not so close that they would put the detainee\u2019s interests before their own.</li> <li>Meaningful bonds: To determine what is a meaningful amount, the Member will look at the person\u2019s income, savings, assets and living expenses. Another consideration when you are determining what amount to put forward as a proposed bond is the seriousness of the danger/flight risk.<ul> <li>For a performance bond in particular, the general rule is that the person\u2019s income (less liabilities) and assets (minus liabilities) are at least three times the amount of the performance bond.</li> <li>It is illegal for the money to be coming from the detainee or for the detainee to be reimbursing the bondsperson if the bond is ultimately forfeited.</li> <li>This type of crowdsourcing reduces the impact of paying the bond on the bondsperson and, as a result, it is less likely to be considered a meaningful bond amount.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Suitability of Bondsperson: several factors to decide whether they believe the bondsperson is suitable,<ul> <li>Whether the bondsperson has been aware of and/or facilitated the detainee\u2019s lack of compliance in the past</li> <li>Whether the bondsperson has a criminal record</li> <li>whether they were successful or not in ensuring compliance for the detainee</li> <li>Whether the person can adequately supervise the detainee</li> <li>Whether they appear to take the position seriously and whether they understand what they are getting themselves into</li> </ul> </li> <li>Supervision Plan: The supervision plan should address the nature of the risks that the bondsperson is meant to offset. For example, you should make sure your bondsperson knows:<ul> <li>How they are going to keep tabs on the person concerned (e.g., will the person concerned live with them? Will they check in by video call regularly?).</li> <li>What they will do if the person concerned is not listening or cooperating (typically the bondsperson should understand that they will have to speak to them and, if need be, report them to the CBSA).</li> <li>How are they going to make sure that the person concerned shows up to report to CBSA/appears for hearings/appears for removal. (E.g., do they have a car? Will they go with them to appointments? etc.).</li> <li>Are other people going to play a role in the supervision of the person concerned (either multiple bondspeople or other support people).  If so \u2013 how are they going to communicate and work together?  If there are multiple people who are going to play a role in the supervision of the person concerned, you will want to make sure that they have met and communicated in advance of the hearing.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> Relevant Questions for the Bondsperson <ul> <li>What is your name? How is it written on your ID?</li> <li>Are you a Canadian citizen or permanent resident?</li> <li>What is your address and telephone number?</li> <li>How do you know the detainee and for how long? Where and when did you meet?</li> <li>Have you helped the detainee in the past when they were underground?</li> <li>When was the last time that you saw/spoke to the detainee? Have you visited the detainee since they were detained? Phone contact? How often?</li> <li>Can the detainee live with you after their release? Is there room? Who else lives there?</li> <li>How far do you live from where the person will be living? How often do you plan to have contact?</li> <li>Do you know what is going on with the detainee\u2019s case/status? Are you aware of their history with Immigration?  Do you know if they have any criminal charges or convictions?</li> <li>What is your occupation and annual salary? How long have you been at that job?</li> <li>Can you get a T-4 from your employer?</li> <li>Are you self employed?</li> <li>If you are self-employed, have you filed taxes? Can you get last year\u2019s Notice of Assessment?</li> <li>Do you have property? Own a house? Can you bring bank statement or house deed? Is there anyone else listed on the deed? (NOTE: they will also have to sign the bond that is based on the property) How much of a mortgage do you have?</li> <li>Do you have any savings? What do your monthly expenses typically total?</li> <li>Have you ever posted a bond before? When? What is the status of that bond?</li> <li>Do you have a criminal record?</li> <li>How much can you post for a cash bond? (Give a range.)</li> <li>How much are you willing to sign for a performance bond? (Give a range.)</li> <li>Do you understand what your role will be as a bondsperson?</li> <li>How will you supervise the detainee?  What will you do if they are not cooperating/listening to you?</li> <li>Can you attend the detention review? (Typically the bondsperson will appear virtually).</li> </ul> Six Common Bond-Related Questions <ul> <li>Why is a bond required?<ul> <li>Bonds may be required as an alternative to detention and as a means of making sure that the conditions of release are followed. For example, a bond can help to make sure that the person will appear for appointments, hearings or interviews regarding removal with Immigration. They can also make sure they advise Immigration of their address before they move. The Member of the Immigration and Refugee Board makes the decision about release at the detention review and determines the amount and type of bond required for release. The person who is offering the bond can suggest what amount they can pay and then the Member will decide if it is enough.</li> </ul> </li> <li>When must the bond be paid?<ul> <li>A Member at the detention review can either make an \u201cOrder for Release\u201d or an order for continued detention. If a release order is made, the bondsperson has until the next detention review to pay the bond, either 7 or 30 days. The detainee will not be released until the bonds are paid/signed.</li> </ul> </li> <li>How do I pay the bonds?<ul> <li>Security deposits (also known as cash bonds) can be paid by credit card (MasterCard or Visa only), debit card, certified cheque, money order or bank draft payable to: The Receiver General of Canada.</li> <li>To show eligibility for guarantees (also known as performance bonds), the bondsperson must present proof of employment in the form of a T4 slip or Notice of Assessment from Revenue Canada if they are self-employed. For every $3000 the bondsperson earns after taxes, they can sign for a $1,000 performance bond. It is also possible to present evidence of liquid assets such as bank savings, convertible stocks or bonds, and real estate (house/condominium deed).</li> </ul> </li> <li>When will my bonds be refunded?<ul> <li>Immigration can hold the money for years in some cases. Your cash bond will be refunded (or your performance bond nullified) 6-8 weeks after the case has been completed, provided the conditions have not been violated. In cases where the individual is ordered to leave the country, you must make sure that they register with Immigration officials in the airport prior to boarding their flight to get a \u201ccertificate of departure\u201d. If the person is granted approval to remain permanently in Canada, the practice of the CBSA is to consider the case complete after the person is granted permanent resident status. This could take up to 24 months after a positive decision is given in a refugee claim or a PRRA. It may be possible to argue that under s.49(3) of the Regulations, the deposit should be returned when the person gets protected person status because they have complied with all of the conditions in their Order for Release. There is no statutory authority to make the bondsperson wait until the person receives permanent resident status.</li> </ul> </li> <li>How can I be relieved from the bond obligation?<ul> <li>If you no longer want to be responsible for the person who has been released, you should call the CBSA or the ID to advise them. You will have to give their name, date of birth, and 8- or 10-digit immigration client identity number. This may be because you think that the person who was released will not comply with the conditions, or that you need your money back. Immigration will not always relieve you of your promise just because you ask them to. Immigration can require you to bring the person in to Immigration or that another, suitable bondsperson is proposed to take your place. Immigration can ask why you want to be relieved of your obligations. Your explanation could affect the person\u2019s ability to be released into the care of another bondsperson. If no alternative bondsperson is found, the person will likely be returned to detention.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Estreat the bonds<ul> <li>Immigration will estreat a bond if the person concerned did not comply with any condition of their release. Estreat means that they will take the cash or move to enforce a promise to pay a performance bond. For example, the person concerned may not have appeared for an appointment with Immigration or they may not have left the country by a set date. As the bondsperson, it was your responsibility to ensure the person concerned complied with the conditions of release, so Immigration is now holding you responsible. You can respond to Immigration\u2019s decision to estreat your bonds by writing a letter and explaining why you believe you should not be held responsible for the violations in the conditions of release. You may want to get legal representation for this.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Putting Together a Comprehensive Release Plan <ul> <li>A list of some potential release conditions can be found in Guideline 2 at 3.2.2.</li> <li>There are also standard conditions that are applied in most cases by the Immigration Division.<ul> <li>Appear whenever required by\u202fCBSA or the Immigration Division, including for removal;</li> <li>Provide\u202fCBSA\u202fwith a travel document or cooperate with\u202fCBSA\u202fin obtaining a travel document.</li> </ul> </li> <li>If the person is a danger to the public, the standard terms and conditions will likely also include:<ul> <li>to not commit criminal offences</li> <li>to report criminal charges or convictions to\u202fCBSA</li> <li>to not possess or use a firearm or other weapon</li> </ul> </li> </ul> CBSA-Controlled Alternatives to Detention <ul> <li>The CBSA controls programs that can form key parts of a proposed alternative to detention. Example programs are the Toronto Bail Program (TBP), the Salvation Army, and the John Howard Society. The Immigration Division will almost always allow release for a client who has been accepted into one of these programs.</li> <li>The CBSA also provides ankle monitoring programs in some regions.</li> <li>When crafting a release plan, you want to make sure that you are addressing the individual risks in your case. The plan that you put forward should address any previous concerns outlined in previous decisions as well as those that are raised by the Minister\u2019s counsel.</li> </ul> Disclosure Prior to the Hearing <ul> <li>If important facts are based on hearsay, get ready to note that in submissions. Where such a fact is central, consider asking the CBSA to have the primary source of the information at the hearing to testify and if they refuse, ask ID for a summons requiring the person from whom the information derives to come to the hearing pursuant to Rule 33 of the ID rules. See Guideline 2 at 7.3.3</li> <li>According to Rule 26 of the Immigration Division Rules, disclosure must be provided at least five days before the hearing for the 30-day detention review. If you are late, you must request the admission of the evidence explaining why it could not be provided earlier, and the relevance and probative value of the documents.</li> <li>For the initial 48-hour and 7-day detention reviews, the rules specify that disclosure is simply \u201cas soon as possible\u201d given the short time frame for these proceedings.</li> <li>If you are calling a witness, this must be done in accordance with Rule 32(1) of the ID Rules and your disclosure cover should also include the witness information required by the Rules (purpose of the testimony, relationship between witness and detainee, expected time for testimony).</li> </ul> Persuasive Submissions <ul> <li>Generally, you can think of oral submissions as having four phases or parts:<ul> <li>A brief opening statement identifying what you want for your client \u2013 the issue and the conclusion</li> <li>The principal elements of your argument (generally, the conclusions that you want the decision maker to reach), which are supported by...</li> <li>References to relevant legal authority (legislation and binding case law) as well as government policy, all of which are explicitly applied to...</li> <li>The relevant facts of your client\u2019s case (this may include a review of results at prior detention review hearings)</li> </ul> </li> <li>your submissions should start by addressing the section 58 grounds that have been used to justify your client\u2019s detention. Typically, you will argue that there are no such grounds to justify detention or that any grounds are at the lower end of the spectrum and then show why this is the case using facts and law.  You should address the factors in ss. 245-257 and applicable sections of Guideline 2 when addressing the grounds as well as any other relevant factors.</li> <li>Emphasize the most important facts in your favour: for example, facts might include a significant change in circumstances from the last hearing, or you might point to errors made in a prior hearing that must be rectified. You will also need to make sure that you address the Minister\u2019s position and any evidence that they have provided to support it.</li> <li>After you present your arguments on the ground for detention, you need to set out how, if the Member finds that a ground for detention is made out, the s. 248 factors favour release. Remember that providing an alternative to detention is just one part of the s. 248 factors that must be canvassed.</li> <li>Finally, as you would do in a written submission structured using CREAC, wrap up your oral submissions by briefly reiterating the legal conclusion you want the decision maker to reach. For example: \u201cfor these reasons, we request that the PC be released as his flight risk falls at the low end of the spectrum and the s. 248 factors favour his release.\u201d</li> </ul>","tags":["ICL870","Notes","Quizzes"]},{"location":"immigration/870/ICL870week6/#quizzes","title":"Quizzes","text":"Module 6: Preparation for the Detention Review <ol> <li> <p>Yuri is preparing a witness, Sui, to testify at the ID hearing for his client, Giovanni.

The CBSA representative can ask the Immigration Division member to keep a person detained if the CBSA believes:</p> <ul> <li>The person is a danger to the public. To support its position, the CBSA may give examples of:<ul> <li>association with a criminal organization</li> <li>criminal convictions or pending charges for sexual offences, certain drug-related offences, or offences involving violence or weapons</li> <li>any behaviour, activities and events that support the claim that the person should be considered dangerous <p>Detainees can provide their own evidence and arguments to show the member why they are not a danger.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li>The person will probably not appear for an immigration hearing or for removal from Canada. To support its position, the CBSA may give examples of times when the person:<ul> <li>did not appear for immigration or court matters</li> <li>did not follow conditions</li> <li>entered a country illegally</li> <li>escaped from custody <p>A detained person can provide their own evidence and arguments to show the member that they will appear when asked to do so.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li>The person's identity has not been established but can be. The detained person may have come to Canada without identity documents or with identity documents that might not be genuine. The CBSA may not be able to confirm the detained person's identity right away.<ul> <li>A person must help the CBSA establish their identity. They can do this by trying to get their identity documents and by giving information that will help the CBSA establish their identity.</li> <li>The Immigration Division member will consider the CBSA's efforts, and the detained person's cooperation with the CBSA in proving their identity, before deciding to continue their detention or to order their release.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The person might be inadmissible to Canada for security reasons or because of a violation of human or international rights, serious criminality, criminality, or organized criminality.<ul> <li>The CBSA will explain what steps they are taking to find out whether the person is inadmissible for one of these reasons. In this situation, the Immigration Division member can only consider whether the CBSA has a reasonable suspicion and is taking the necessary steps to investigate it.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Other factors that will be considered in a detention review. The member must consider the reasons a person is in detention, and also:<ul> <li>how long they have been in detention</li> <li>how long detention might continue if they are not released</li> <li>whether they or the CBSA have caused any unexplained delay</li> <li>any alternative to detention that is available</li> <li>the best interests of any directly affected child <p>Detainees may present evidence and arguments about any of these factors for the member to consider.</p> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>There may be an alternative to detention. An alternative to detention is a release plan that may include conditions the detained person must obey. The detained person can suggest an alternative to detention. When preparing for their hearing, detained persons should think about reasonable alternatives to detention. Conditions could include:<ul> <li>providing the CBSA with their residential address</li> <li>reporting regularly to the CBSA</li> <li>obeying a curfew</li> <li>living with a specific person</li> <li>avoiding drinking alcohol or taking drugs</li> <li>any other conditions that are needed in the case <p>The member will decide if conditions are necessary and what they should be.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li>The alternative to detention may also include a bond. There are 2 types of bonds:<ul> <li>Deposit (also called a cash bond): Money is deposited with the government before the detained person is released. If the detained person does not obey the conditions, the Government of Canada will keep the money and CBSA may arrest and detain the person again. If the detained person obeys the conditions, CBSA will eventually return the money to the bondsperson.</li> <li>Guarantee (also called a performance bond): The bondsperson promises to pay an amount of money if the detained person does not obey release conditions. If the detained person does not obey the conditions, the Government of Canada will collect the money from the bondsperson and the CBSA may arrest and detain the person again. For a guarantee, the bondsperson must be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident of Canada and must show that they can afford to pay the bond and can ensure the detained person will obey the release conditions. <p>The person who provides the bond is known as a bondsperson. At the hearing, the CBSA representative and the member may ask the proposed bondsperson for information that will help the member decide if the bond is suitable. The bondsperson can provide this information before the hearing by completing a Bondsperson Information form.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li>A person can ask the Immigration Division to change or cancel their conditions.<ul> <li>If the detained person's situation changes after conditions are imposed, they can write a letter to the Immigration Division explaining why they think their conditions should be changed and send a copy of the letter to the CBSA. They can use the Application to vary conditions of release form to help write this letter.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Two Formats for Detention Review <ul> <li>Separate Evidence and Argument<ul> <li>Pre-hearing discussions with CBSA Hearings Officer</li> <li>Start of hearing: Introduction by Board Member and entry of exhibits</li> <li>CBSA Provides Information/Updates to the Member and states position in continued detention (summary phase).

For most immigration-related inadmissibilities \u2013 like failing to appear for an examination (IRPR, paragraph 229(1)(j)) \u2013 the removal order is issued by the Officer themselves under section 44(2).</li> <li>Departure Order: A departure order is issued for less serious breaches of Canadian immigration law. If the person leaves Canada within 30 days of the issuance of the order, and obtains a certificate of departure when they leave Canada, they can apply to come back in the future without any special authorization required.</li> <li>Exclusion Order: An exclusion order is a removal order that carries with it the penalty of barring return to Canada for between one and five years unless you can get special permission to return. An exclusion order is issued for immigration penalties like failing to report for an examination or for misrepresentation. If issued an exclusion order, the person must also apply for an Authorization to Return to Canada (ARC) under section 52 of the IRPA if they want to come back within the period of the bar on return.</li> <li>Deportation Order: A deportation order permanently bars someone from ever coming back to Canada without an ARC. This is typically issued by the Immigration Division for security or criminality inadmissibility.</li> <li>Sections 223 to 226 of IRPR sets out which removal order will apply to which situation.</li> <li>Sections 230-234 of IRPR: remedies include a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA), a positive decision on a humanitarian and compassionate application (H&amp;C), and a positive decision on a motion for a judicial stay of removal.</li> <li>The most commonly used applications for people who have exhausted their other remedies to stay in Canada:<ul> <li>PRRA: a PRRA application suspends enforcement of a removal order. In most cases, Protected Person status (i.e., refugee protection and the ability to apply for permanent residence as a protected person); If inadmissible under sections 34-37, a stay of removal.</li> <li>H&amp;C: Deportation continue while the application is in process. An approval in principle for permanent residence pending security, criminality, medical and other inadmissibility checks</li> <li>Temporary Residence Permit (TRP): Deportation continue while the application is in process. Valid temporary residence in Canada, which if issued for over six months, includes a right to apply for a work and study permit, for the duration of the permit.</li> <li>Deferral Request: Deportation continue while the application is in process. Removal is \u201cdeferred\u201d or postponed, pending some other application (the decision on your H&amp;C or TRP) or event (for example, the birth of a child or the end of a school year).</li> </ul> </li> <li>As you know the PRRA is based on sections 96 and 97 (i.e., harms in your country of origin), while the H&amp;C is a holistic assessment of establishment in Canada, the best interests of children, and any adverse country conditions to determine if as a whole the evidence \u201cwould excite in a reasonable [person] in a civilized community a desire to relieve the misfortunes of another\u201d: Kanthasamy v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 SCC 61, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 909, citing Chirwa v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (1970), 4 I.A.C. 338.</li> <li>TRP does not stop removal and take time for a decision, you will typically end up using deferral requests and H&amp;Cs more frequently.</li> <li>Often deferral requests are rejected, and so must be followed by a motion for a stay of removal in Federal Court, for which your client will have to retain a lawyer.</li> </ul> Choosing the Right Application <ul> <li>PRRA Application.<ul> <li>A person is \u201cPRRA-barred\u201d or cannot bring a PRRA until a year after the last decision in their refugee claim. If a year has passed there is no problem, but if it has not, the client will need to combine their PRRA with a Deferral Request to postpone removal until the person is eligible for a PRRA.</li> <li>For persons inadmissible for security, international crimes, serious criminality and organized criminality (ss. 34-37), the Officer can only look at section 97 risks (torture) and cannot get permanent protection from the PRRA but only a stay of removal based on a subsequent balancing of risk with the person\u2019s danger to Canada: See section 113 of the IRPA.</li> </ul> </li> <li>H&amp;C Application.<ul> <li>There is also a 12-month H&amp;C bar from the last day of any refugee refusal. The bar has two exceptions: if the best interests of the child are affected by the application and if there are life-threatening health issues in the country of origin.</li> <li>Persons who have been found inadmissible under sections 34 (security), 35 (international crimes), or 37 (organized criminality) cannot apply for an H&amp;C.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Temporary Resident Permit (TRP).<ul> <li>A TRP is like an H&amp;C but it is for a given length of time. It is an option for people who have a specific reason to remain for a given period and then leave, or those who have inadmissibilities that prevent them from bringing an H&amp;C.</li> <li>Usually, unless your client is barred from an H&amp;C by a section 34-36 inadmissibility, you will want to bring an H&amp;C instead.</li> <li>IRPA sections 24(3.1)-24(4): it cannot be requested if your client has been found ineligible to have their claim referred to the RPD and a PRRA application is pending, and it cannot be requested within a year of the final refusal of a refugee claim by either the IRB or (if judicial review has been sought) the Federal Court.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Deferral Request.<ul> <li>Finally there is the deferral request made directly to an officer pursuant to IRPA section 48. It asks a deferral officer to exercise their discretion to postpone the removal based on a compelling circumstance.</li> <li>The deferral request is a last resort and it cannot be submitted until a deportation date is set.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Weighing your Client's Options <ul> <li>The Waschlo Family. The Waschlo family are citizens of Poland. They are Joseph, his wife, Olga and their two children aged six and nine. Joseph used to work for the military and received threats after he reported corruption in his unit. His refugee claim was refused on credibility and state protection and the judicial review of his RAD appeal was denied three weeks ago. Joseph says that he learned during the judicial review application that his brother has recently disappeared and the family does not know why but suspects it may relate to the risk from the security and intelligence forces. The family have been in Canada for three years, Joseph works full-time in construction and Olga works part-time as a nurse. Olga\u2019s sister lives in Canada and is a Canadian citizen. Her children are close to Joseph and Olga\u2019s children.<ul> <li>What factors speak for and against a PRRA?<ul> <li>The disappearance of Joseph\u2019s brother is a new fact that may prove that the family is at risk despite the RPD and RAD decisions. This speaks to the need for a PRRA; however, the family are PRRA-barred by IRPA section 112(2)(b.1).</li> <li>You will want to have them prepare this possible evidence just in case as well as start arranging for psychiatric reports to speak to the harm of removal. They will get a letter from the CBSA when enforcement action will be taken. You need to make sure that they can get mail from the CBSA either through their former counsel or their address. Strategically, quickly updating the address will bring the CBSA\u2019s attention to your clients so you don\u2019t want to if you can help it; but, if there is no other way to get mail you will have no other choice. Your hope is that the CBSA sits on the file a long time to get you as close as possible to the end of the PRRA-bar, and an even longer time for a decision on the H&amp;C.</li> </ul> </li> <li>What factors speak for and against an H&amp;C?<ul> <li>Your clients are H&amp;C barred as well, but as their application will be based on the best interests of the child, they meet an exception to the bar. The family\u2019s work history, their children\u2019s formative years as young children (for a six-year-old, three years in Canada is half their life), their children\u2019s proficiency in English over Polish, their family connections and community connections, and their work history in Canada all make it advisable to try an H&amp;C.</li> </ul> </li> <li>How should you advise your client?<ul> <li>If a removal date is set before the end of a PRRA-bar, the only hope will be a deferral based on the new evidence of risk in Poland and any evidence about psychological harm to the children from being removed to Canada and going to Poland where they have never been.</li> <li>Have an honest conversation with the family at the beginning. While a PRRA will keep them in Canada if you can get there, it is by no means a sure thing since the IRB has already found their risk not to be credible. Their H&amp;C is their best chance, but three years in Canada is not an exceptionally long period of time and there is no particular factor (like a health condition that will go untreated in the home country) that makes it especially compelling. It definitely has a chance due to the children\u2019s connection to Canada and the family\u2019s good work history but there are no guarantees. Finally, if a deferral and stay is required, and the family do not qualify for legal aid, the costs for all of the potential applications here may be close to $10,000 or more.</li> <li>How to proceed is the family\u2019s choice. If they deeply fear a return to Poland and/or cannot bear to leave Canada, then this is their only chance. Your job is to give them a realistic picture of what is available and their chances of success so that they can make an informed decision.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Prasanna. Prasanna is a citizen of India. He came to Canada in 2011 and studied in his undergraduate degree in Toronto, graduating in 2016. Although he worked after graduation, he was not able to find full-time work in his field and thus does not qualify for PR through Canada Experience Class. For the last three years he has been working cash jobs in various fields. In 2017, he married his longtime girlfriend who is a Canadian citizen and in 2019 his wife gave birth to their daughter. Late that same year she applied to sponsor him through an in-Canada spousal sponsorship. Tragically, in 2020, with the sponsorship still in progress, Prasanna\u2019s wife died of cancer. His former counsel updated immigration about this development and they denied the sponsorship. He is now being called in to report to the CBSA. What can he do?<ul> <li>What factors speak for and against a PRRA?<ul> <li>As a removal order is now in force, Prasanna cannot make a refugee claim. He could ask for a PRRA but when you inquire, he does not fear anything in India.</li> </ul> </li> <li>What factors speak for and against an H&amp;C?<ul> <li>The most compelling fact in Prasanna\u2019s situation is the plight of his Canadian daughter, who has just tragically lost her mother. This kind of humanitarian factor could have been taken into account in the sponsorship application if Prasanna\u2019s former counsel had raised these grounds. As such, the first step may be a request to reopen the sponsorship to ask for approval of the PR on H&amp;C grounds based on the best interests of his daughter.</li> </ul> </li> <li>How should you advise your client?<ul> <li>Along with reopening the application for sponsorship, Prasanna would do well to get an H&amp;C application in as soon as possible. The baby's maternal grandparents are willing to care for their granddaughter so that she can remain in Canada. However, the baby will lose both her parents in close succession if her father is deported. You should advise him to get a psychological assessment done and obtain letters that show his establishment in Canada, his closeness to his late wife\u2019s family and letters from them about how they cannot bear to lose their son-in-law after suffering such a loss.</li> <li>When a removal date is finally set, Prasanna will have to apply for a deferral of removal pending the H&amp;C. He would base this on psychological harm of leaving Canada after so long, of the impact on his right to parent his daughter, and on the impact of his Canadian daughter of not being with her father.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> PRRA <ul> <li>A PRRA is most commonly brought by refused refugee claimants based on new events or evidence that was not reasonably available at the time of their refugee claim.</li> <li>The Federal Court in Figurado v Minister (Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 FC 347, described the purpose of the PRRA as follows:<ul> <li>[40]The PRRA process was implemented to allow individuals to apply for a review of the conditions surrounding the risk of return prior to their removal from Canada and not after their removal. Indeed, the PRRA emerged as a result of the jurisprudence of the Federal Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada, which required a timely risk assessment to comply with section 7 of the Charter [Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, being Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, Schedule B, Canada Act 1982, 1982, c. 11 (U.K.) [R.S.C., 1985, Appendix II, No. 44]] (Farhadi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2000), 6 Imm. L.R. (3d) 80 (F.C.A.); Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 SCC 1 (CanLII), [2002] 1 S.C.R. 3).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Section 112 tells us that a PRRA can only be submitted once you are subject to a removal order that is in force. Your client will be called in to CBSA during removal proceedings and, if they are eligible, invited for a PRRA. Clients must wait for the PRRA to be initiated by the CBSA.</li> <li>For those who are PRRA-eligible, they will be given the PRRA form by the CBSA and told that they have 15 days to provide the form and 30 days to provide evidence and submissions.</li> <li>As long as the form is submitted in that time, your client will benefit from the statutory stay of removal in section 232 of the IRPR until the PRRA is decided.</li> <li>A second PRRA does not give an automatic stay.</li> <li>You need to show one of the following:<ul> <li>Things have changed in the country of origin so that findings about risk made at the IRB are no longer correct</li> <li>Things have changed for your client such that there are now new risks that were not assessed by the IRB</li> <li>Things have changed for your client such that there is now important new evidence that might have changed the IRB\u2019s mind but could not be presented earlier</li> </ul> </li> <li>The limitation of the PRRA to \u201cnew evidence\u201d is codified in IRPA subsection 113(a):<ul> <li>an applicant whose claim to refugee protection has been rejected may present only new evidence that arose after the rejection or was not reasonably available, or that the applicant could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection;</li> </ul> </li> <li>In addition, subsection 161(2) of the IRPR provides:<ul> <li>A person who makes written submissions must identify the evidence presented that meets the requirements of paragraph 113(a) of the Act and indicate how that evidence relates to them.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Raza v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2007 FCA 385. In setting out the test at paragraph 13, the Court of Appeal clarified that the test is just \u201cnew evidence\u201d. It can be about the same risk but must meet the following criteria (Raza Test).<ul> <li>Credibility</li> <li>Relevance</li> <li>Newness</li> <li>Materiality</li> <li>Express statutory condidtions</li> </ul> </li> <li>It is possible to ask for an extension beyond the 30 day deadline, but you must be clear about the reason it is needed and when you expect to provide you evidence and submissions. If your extension request has not been answered, and you are within the deadline for documents you set in your request, it will be a breach of procedural fairness for the PRRA Officer to decide against you: see for example, Kim v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2020 FC 581</li> <li>The documents you are looking for to support a PRRA are substantially the same as you would in preparing for a refugee hearing at the IRB. The criteria are the same: whether your client faces a serious possibility of persecution for a Convention reason under section 96, and whether they face a likelihood of torture, cruel and inhuman treatment or death, under section 97 of the IRPA.</li> <li>PRRAs are decided on paper, so your written submissions are very important.</li> <li>The criteria for an oral hearing to be called in accordance with IRPA subsection 113(b) is set out in IRPR s. 167:<ul> <li>For the purpose of determining whether a hearing is required under paragraph 113(b) of the Act, the factors are the following:<ul> <li>(a)\u202fwhether there is evidence that raises a serious issue of the applicant\u2019s credibility and is related to the factors set out in sections 96 and 97 of the Act;</li> <li>(b)\u202fwhether the evidence is central to the decision with respect to the application for protection; and</li> <li>(c)\u202fwhether the evidence, if accepted, would justify allowing the application for protection.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>There is case law that the failure to explain why an oral hearing is not being held when it is requested can lead to a PRRA decision being set aside (for example, Plata Vasquez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FC 279)</li> <li>remember that inadmissible persons even if successful in the s.97 PRRA do not get protected person status and the ability to apply for permanent residence. The only way out of this predicament is ministerial relief.</li> </ul> H&amp;C <ul> <li>The affidavit sets out your client's story and highlights the circumstances relevant to the H&amp;C request. It aims to paint a picture of the person or family\u2019s life in Canada and how difficult it would be to leave Canada and return to their country of origin. Here you will recall that it is important to be mindful of IRCC's operational guidelines such as  \"Humanitarian and compassionate considerations.\"</li> <li>Supporting personal documents provide the evidence in support of anything asserted to be true in the affidavit.</li> <li>Supporting country documents, including but not limited to IRCC's National Documentation Packages, support the assertion that your client will face hardship in their country.</li> <li>The written submission summarizes the case for the Officer; highlights the relevant facts, law and evidence; and applies the law to facts to show how the desired outcome can be reached.</li> <li>Once the H&amp;C application is fully in and ready to be decided, the next steps depend on CBSA. Many times your client will be subject to a removal order but not necessarily be given a removal date.</li> </ul> TRP <ul> <li>A TRP application carries the risk of reminding CBSA about your enforceable removal order and initiating removal action, when it is in your client\u2019s best interest to lay low and collect time in Canada for the H&amp;C to be decided.</li> <li>Those being found inadmissible for organized criminality under IRPA s.37. are ineligible for an H&amp;C due to an inadmissibility. They can apply for a TRP.</li> </ul> Deferral Requests <ul> <li>If a deportation date has been set, the only way to stop a removal is with a deferral request made to the CBSA asking the Removal Officer to exercise their discretion under IRPA s. 48 to postpone the removal.</li> <li>Kalaba v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2020 FC 959, at para 1:<ul> <li>Officers with the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA) charged with enforcing a removal order against someone not entitled to remain in Canada have a very limited discretion to defer removal. Removal may be deferred where the person being removed will be exposed to a risk of death, extreme sanction, or inhumane treatment; or based on short-term considerations, such as illness or other impediments to removal, the short-term best interests of a child, or the existence of pending immigration applications that were filed in a timely way.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Deferrals are frequently refused, but when they are, the person concerned can bring a stay of removal in Federal Court based on a judicial review of the Officer\u2019s decision to refuse the request.</li> <li>As Justice Russel W. Zinn stated in a presentation to the County of Carleton Law Association (November 1, 2012), \"In order for the Court to stay removal, an applicant must satisfy the tripartite test for interlocutory injunctions set out in RJR MacDonald Inc v Canada, [1994] 1 SCR 311. In the immigration context, this is typically referred to as the Toth test, referring to Toth v Canada (Minister of Employment &amp; Immigration) (1988), 6 Imm LR (2d) 123, 86 NR 302 (FCA).\" The three parts of the Toth test are:<ul> <li>a serious issue with the reasonableness or fairness of the decision not to defer removal</li> <li>irreparable harm that will result if the person is deported</li> <li>that the balance of convenience favours the person applying for the stay. What this test generally amounts to is again convincing someone \u2013 this time the judge \u2013 that there is evidence that serious harm will follow from deportation.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The deferral request ultimately amounts to a letter of a few pages to the CBSA officer setting out<ul> <li>a point the deportation should be postponed for (be it a PRRA; a decision on a spousal sponsorship; the birth of a child; the date of eligibility for a pardon from a criminal conviction)</li> <li>the harm that will be caused by the deportation, followed by the evidence you have of that harm.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Deferral Requests for PRRA-Barred Refugees<ul> <li>the Minister has issued guidelines that were relied upon by the Federal Court of Appeal in Atawnah v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness), 2016 FCA 144 to give broader discretion to defer so that a PRRA-barred person could access a PRRA:<ul> <li>[15] ...after this Court\u2019s decision in Shpati, the Canada Border Services Agency issued Operational Bulletin: PRG-2014-22 entitled \"Procedures relating to an officer\u2019s consideration of new allegations of risk at the deferral of removal stage.\" This bulletin gives enforcement officer\u2019s [sic] broader discretion to defer removal than the discretion described in Shpati.</li> <li>[16]\u202fEnforcement officers are instructed to \u201cconsider/assess the evidence submitted, when there are allegations of risk to the applicant upon execution of their removal order\u201d. When an officer concludes that deferral of removal is warranted, the allegations of risk are to be forwarded to Citizenship and Immigration Canada, now Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, for consideration under section 25.1 of the Act. Among other things, section 25.1 allows the Minister, on his own initiative, to exempt a foreign national from the application of the PRRA bar contained in paragraph 112(2)(b.1) of the Act.</li> </ul> </li> <li>What this means in a deferral request for a PRRA-barred claimant is that you are essentially doing a mini-version of a PRRA to show an Officer that a full PRRA is needed. Like in a PRRA, you are not re-arguing the previous decisions but distinguishing them as now overtaken by new evidence.</li> <li>The submissions themselves take the form of a letter and should be brief, clear and to the point. Unless it is an extremely complicated case, a deferral request letter should not be more than 5 pages. Get the officer\u2019s attention with evidence that terrible suffering will happen if you carry out this removal.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Deferral Requests for other Reasons<ul> <li>A pending H&amp;C application or a pending spousal sponsorship are not in themselves enough of a reason to grant a deferral. However, the harms identified in an H&amp;C can constitute serious personal harm if there is evidence of their severity.</li> <li>The most compelling evidence you can get is medical \u2013 on any problems with the flight or care that cannot be accessed in the home country \u2013 and psychological on the immense trauma and even suicidal thoughts your client may face if removed.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Three Basic Human Rights Protections <ul> <li>The international human rights treaties that Canada has signed - the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights; the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR); and the International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights (ICESCR) - impose limits on Canada\u2019s ability to expel. There are three main protections that we will discuss here.</li> <li>Non-Refoulement:<ul> <li>You have already come across non-refoulement \u2013 the \u201ccornerstone\u201d of Canada\u2019s refugee protection regime: N\u00e9meth v Canada (Justice), 2010 SCC 56 at para. 1.</li> <li>By becoming a signatory to the Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees (\u201cRefugee Convention\u201d), Canada agreed that except in certain proscribed circumstances (such as where someone has committed war crimes or is a serious danger to the public) they are forbidden from deporting if the person may face persecution on return.</li> <li>Singh; Suresh; and Farhadi v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2000 CanLII 15491 (FCA)</li> <li>In Singh, it was held that section 7 of the Charter applies to the refugee determination process as it would be \u201cunthinkable\u201d that these protections would not be present given the risk of persecution that is at stake.</li> <li>a PRRA before removal (see B010 v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 SCC 58 at para 75)</li> <li>section 7 of the Charter is engaged at the PRRA and deferral stages, citing B010 and Kreishan v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FCA 223</li> <li>Courts have consistently held that deportation for a non-refugee does not engage section 7 of the Charter: see Medovarski v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration); and Esteban v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2005 SCC 51 at para. 46. This is controversial ... This point was recently re-litigated in Revell v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FCA 262 and the legal principle was upheld.</li> <li>In the extradition context, it has been held that a removal for a trial elsewhere will breach section 7 where it would shock the conscience, such as for example deportation to the US where the penalty for a crime could be the death penalty: United States v Burns, 2001 SCC 7.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Right to remain in one's own country:<ul> <li>Under Article 12(4) of the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights (ICCPR), Canada has committed itself to the principle that \u201cno one shall be arbitrarily deprived of the right to enter their own country.\u201d The UN Human Rights Committee in its General Comment 27 has explained that one\u2019s \u201cown country\u201d is broader than just citizenship.</li> <li>You may argue that as the harm of removal is so disproportionate to the need for Canada to rid itself of your client that doing so would violate ICCPR Article 12, and that discretion of the officer must be exercised to ensure this does not happen.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Right to Family Life:<ul> <li>The ICCPR under Article 17 also protects against arbitrary deprivations of family life.</li> <li>Once again what makes the deprivation or interference \u201carbitrary\u201d will be the deprivation of family life is fundamental, such as a parent or child, spouses, or any other relationship if you put in evidence about why the family relationship is fundamental to well-being.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Again be very precise in your submissions about how the international obligations come into play in the analysis. They matter because Parliament was clear in IRPA paragraph 3(3)(f) that they are prioritizing international human rights law in the interpretation of the IRPA.</li> </ul>","tags":["ICL870","Notes","Quizzes"]},{"location":"immigration/870/ICL870week8/#quizzes","title":"Quizzes","text":"Module 8: Removal Orders <ol> <li> <p>Who would issue the removal order if your client has been found inadmissible for failing to leave Canada before the end of the period authorized for their stay?</p> <ul> <li> Deportation order</li> <li> Exclusion order</li> <li> Departure order <p>See 228(1)(c)(iv) of IRPR.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>What kind of removal order would be issued if your client has been found inadmissible under s. 41(b) of IRPA for failing to meet the conditions of their permanent residency?</p> <ul> <li> Deportation order</li> <li> Exclusion order</li> <li> Departure order <p>See 229(1)(k) of IRPR.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>What kind of removal order would be issued if your client has been found inadmissible for serious criminality?</p> <ul> <li> Deportation order</li> <li> Exclusion order</li> <li> Departure order <p>See 229(1)(c) of IRPR.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>What kind of removal order would be issued if your client has been found inadmissible for misrepresentation under 40(1)(c) of IPRA?</p> <ul> <li> Deportation order</li> <li> Exclusion order</li> <li> Departure order <p>See 228(1)(b) of IRPR.

The Minister is planning to enforce a removal order against Imeka. Prior to making a refugee claim in Canada, Imeka stayed at a refugee camp in Nigeria for 6 months. Before that, Imeka took 3 months to travel across Togo.  Which of the following country would Imeka be removed to?</p> <ul> <li> Nigeria</li> <li> Togo</li> <li> Ghana</li> <li> Imeka has a choice between Nigeria or Togo <p>See Chapter 3, \"Removal, Departure and Return\".

The ID found Mohammed to be inadmissible and issued a removal order. Ian advises Mohammed to apply for a judicial stay before the Federal Court of Canada. Ian knows that to succeed in this application, the Court must be satisfied that all branches of the tripartite test for a stay have been met on a standard of:</p> <ul> <li> Reasonable grounds to believe</li> <li> Balance of probabilities</li> <li> The balance of convenience</li> <li> Beyond a reasonable doubt <p>See Chapter 3, \"Judicial Stay of Removal: The Federal Court Stay Application\".

A refugee claimant further benefits from a stay of removal where they file an application for leave and judicial review within the stipulated deadlines with the Federal Court with respect to a refusal to grant protection by the RAD.

Attorney General of Canada, 2023 ONSC 7152</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Who is a Canadian? <ul> <li>There are two ways someone can be a citizen without applying for it: jus soli and jus sanguinis.</li> <li>jus sanguinis means citizenship by decent. It currently applies to the first generation born abroad (Bill C-24, 2008). Following the Bjorkquist decision (2023), Bill C-71 was introduced in 2024 and proposes to replace the second generation cut-off with a \"substantial connection\" test going forward.</li> <li>jus soli means citizenship by birth on Canadian soil. Birthright citizenship is automatic but subject to limited exceptions, including: the children of diplomats and foreign officials, who are not granted citizenship because their parents enjoy diplomatic immunity.</li> <li>Bjorkquist and Bill C-3 summary (first generation born abroad)<ul> <li>In 2008, a \u201csecond-generation cut-off\u201d rule was implemented, which limited citizenship by descent to the first generation born abroad pursuant to s. 3(3)(a) Citizenship Act. In practical terms, if a Canadian obtained their citizenship by descent while being born abroad, the amendment prohibited them passing on their citizenship to their child also born abroad.</li> <li>Bill C-3: An Act to amend the Citizenship Act (2025)  introduces a substantial connection test to allow a Canadian parent born abroad, who acquires Canadian citizenship by descent, to pass on citizenship to their child born abroad.</li> <li>To meet the substantial connection test, a Canadian parent born abroad would need to demonstrate they have accumulated at least 1,095 days of physical presence in Canada before the birth or adoption of the child. The 1,095 day requirement is cumulative, not in a five (5) year period preceding the birth.</li> </ul> </li> <li>The Jus soli exception for diplomatic immunity was tested in the case of Vavilov.<ul> <li>The government originally argued that, despite being born in Toronto, Vavilov did not enjoy birthright citizenship, because his parents were \"employees or representatives of a foreign government.\" The decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, who ruled in Vavlov's favor and his citizenship was reinstated.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Applicants who have citizenship by birth or by descent do not need to apply for citizenship. They need to apply for proof of citizenship (i.e., citizenship certificates). This is a different application, which requires identity documents and is usually fairly straightforward. The application process can be expedited if the applicant needs citizenship urgently (e.g., for work-related issues).</li> </ul> Requirements for adult grants <ul> <li>Adult grants are covered under section 5(1) of the Citizenship Act. Any of the above requirements can be assessed at any point (e.g., hearings or interviews) during the processing of an application for the grant of citizenship.</li> <li>Make an application for Canadian citizenship or, in the case of a minor, have a person empowered to act on their behalf make the applications [s 5(1)(a)]</li> <li>Be a permanent resident of Canada and have no unfulfilled conditions relating to that status [s 5(1)(c)]</li> <li>Meet residency requirements which include (i) physical presence and (iii) income tax filing [s 5(1)(c)]</li> <li>Have adequate knowledge of one of Canada\u2019s official languages [s 5(1)(d)]</li> <li>Demonstrate in one of Canada\u2019s official languages adequate knowledge of Canada, and the responsibilities and privileges of citizenships [s 5(1)(e)]</li> <li>Not be prohibited under section 21 or 22 of the Citizenship Act</li> <li>Not be under removal order and not subject of a declaration by the Governor in Council made pursuant to section 20 [s 5(1)(f)]</li> </ul> Residency requirements <ul> <li>Adult applicants must:<ul> <li>Be physically present in Canada for at least 1095 days during the 5 years immediately before the date of application; and</li> <li>Meet any applicable requirement under the Income Tax Act to file a return of income for the 3 taxation years that are fully or partially within the 5 years immediately before the date of application<ul> <li>There is no minimum income requirement, but your client needs proof that taxes were filed and the Income Tax Act was followed, even if no taxes were owed or payment was not required due to an exemption (e.g. U.N. officials).</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>As of October 11, 2017, time spent in Canada as an authorized temporary resident or protected person may be partially used towards an applicant\u2019s physical presence calculation.<ul> <li>Each day spent in Canada as a temporary resident or protected person, before becoming a permanent resident within the five-year period before the date of application will count as one half day, with a maximum of 365 days towards the physical presence calculation</li> <li>Temporary resident status includes lawful authorization to enter or remain in Canada as a: visitor, student; worker, or temporary resident permit holder</li> <li>A protected person is someone who was found to be in need of protection or a convention refugee by the Immigration and Refugee Board, or a person who received a positive decision on a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRAA) from IRCC</li> <li>Note: time spent as a refugee claimant (or family member) before positive determination does not count</li> </ul> </li> <li>Any part of a day spent in Canada counts as a full day (day trips should be declared but do not count as absence.)</li> <li>Count from date the application is signed (not from when it is received by IRCC or mailed or assessed) and count back five years. This can be helpful or hurtful, but always be sure to leave a buffer.</li> <li>There are exceptions for armed forces serving overseas and spouses (See Module 2 for details).</li> <li>A Travel History Report is a record of a traveller's entries, exits or both into Canada as collected by CBSA.

An adoptive parent who is a Canadian citizen, a permanent resident who resides in Canada or a Canadian citizen who intends to reside in Canada once the immigration process is complete An adoptive parent who is a Canadian citizen born or naturalized in Canada at the time of the adoption Child's status at the end of the process Permanent resident Canadian citizen Foreign citizenship The adopted person does not lose their foreign citizenship once they become a permanent resident of Canada. In some countries, the adopted person could lose their foreign citizenship once they become a Canadian citizen.

For the past 10 years, she has been looking after her nephew, Miguel, since his parents passed away when he was 12 years old. Most recently, Anna has decided to return Canada and has adopted Miguel under the laws of Mexico. Is it possible for Miguel to be granted citizenship? </p> <ul> <li> No, because Miguel is 20 years old and is too old to be granted citizenship based on adoption.</li> <li> No, because the adoption was not done in accordance with Canadian laws. </li> <li> Yes, because Anna was residing in Mexico at the time of the adoption. </li> <li> No, because Miguel was not a minor at the time of the adoption.  </li> </ul> <p>Pursuant to s. 5.1(2) of the Citizenship Act adult adoptions may qualify for citizenship if </p> <ul> <li> <p>(a) there was a genuine relationship of parent and child between the person and the adoptive parent before the person attained the age of 18 years and at the time of the adoption; and </p> </li> <li> <p>(b) the adoption meets the requirements set out in paragraphs 5.1(1)(c) to (d). This includes the fact the adoption must have been in accordance with the laws of the country where it took place and where the citizen was residing. </p> </li> </ul> <p>In the immediate scenario, the adoption took place in Mexico where Anna was residing and it appears there is has been a genuine relationship of parent/child for many years. Notably, the question asks if it is possible for Miguel to be granted citizenship, as these as well as other sometimes subjective factors would have to be assessed by IRCC.  </p> </li> <li> <p>Which of the following individuals may be considered for a special grant of citizenship? </p> <ul> <li> An athlete who as a PR has excelled at domestic competition and may represent Canada at the Olympics.</li> <li> A U.N. official who works in conflict zones abroad for most of the year, but whose primary home and family are all in Canada.</li> <li> An individual who has lived in Canada for many years but is stateless.</li> <li> All of the above.  </li> </ul> <p>Section 5(4) of the Citizenship Act provides the Minister broad discretion as follows:  </p> <p>(4)\u202fDespite any other provision of this Act, the Minister may, in his or her discretion, grant citizenship to any person to alleviate cases of statelessness or of special and unusual hardship or to reward services of an exceptional value to Canada. </p> <p>While the cases above may not be granted, they can be considered by the Minister per the wording of s. 5(4).  </p> </li> <li> <p>Mark has lived in Canada for the past 20 years, where owns a house and small business. His wife and children are all Canadian citizens. In the last few years, he has had to travel back and forth to the U.K. to attend to his mother who is ill. Recently, he applied for citizenship but it turns out he miscalculated and is 2 days short of the 1,095 days of residence required (i.e. 1,093). If the file is referred to a Citizenship Judge, can the Judge grant Mark's application in her discretion?  </p> <ul> <li> Yes, if she determines Mark's place of continual habitual residence is in Canada.</li> <li> Yes, because it is a de minimis shortfall.</li> <li> Yes, if the Judge believes there are sufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds. </li> <li> No, a Citizenship Judge does not have the discretion to grant the application.   <p>While this type of discretion existed for many years, it was removed following the passage of Bill C-24 in 2015.  </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Naruhito is a 16 year old permanent resident of Canada. He has lived in Canada for the last 8 years. He became a PR as part of the application of his parents who are also permanent residents who spend a majority their time working abroad. During the school year, Naruhito resides primarily at his school dormitories at a private boarding school. Is Naruhito entitled to apply for citizenship? </p> <ul> <li> Yes, under s. 5(1) of the Act if he has met his residence and other requirements. </li> <li> Yes, under s. 5(2) of the Act if he has met his residence and other requirements.</li> <li> No, because neither of his parents are Canadian citizens.</li> <li> <p> No, because neither of his parents meet the residence requirements and cannot include him as part of their application.  </p> <p>Following Bill C-16 in 2017, minors can now apply for citizenship without a Canadian parent, as the age requirement for citizenship has been removed under subsection 5(1). A person having custody of the minor or empowered to act on their behalf by court order, written agreement or operation of law, can now apply for citizenship on behalf of the minor.  </p> <p>This may be beneficial in myriad circumstances such as if the minor has more residence in the Canada than the parents; for example, if they have spent time living with relatives in Canada or in boarding school while parents are abroad. Counsel may also consider this option if there are hurdles to obtaining the parents' citizenship, such as a prohibition stemming from a prior criminal conviction or an active investigation. In certain circumstances, if minors have applied with parents and that application is suspended under s. 13.1 of the Act, counsel may consider filing a separate application for the minors. </p> <p>B is not the correct answer. Under s. 5(2) of the Citizenship Act, a legal guardian who is not a Canadian citizen may apply for citizenship on behalf of the minor child but Canadian citizenship can only be granted if one of the parents (natural or adoptive) is already a Canadian citizen. </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Which of the following are among the legal requirements for an adopted child of a citizen to be granted citizenship under the Act? </p> <ul> <li> the adoption\u202fwas in the best interests of the child</li> <li> the adoption\u202f created a genuine relationship of parent and child</li> <li> the adoption\u202f was in accordance with the laws of the place where the adoption took place and the laws of the country of residence of the adopting citizen</li> <li> the adoption\u202f did not occur in a manner that circumvented the legal requirements for international adoptions</li> <li> the adoption\u202f was not entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring a status or privilege in relation to immigration or citizenship</li> <li> all of the above <p>These are all requirements under s. 5.1(1) of the Act.  </p> </li> </ul> </li> </ol>","tags":["ICL880","Notes","Quizzes"]},{"location":"immigration/880/ICL880week3/","title":"Module 3: Prohibitions, Investigations, and Suspensions","text":"","tags":["ICL880","Notes","Quizzes"]},{"location":"immigration/880/ICL880week3/#notes","title":"Notes","text":"Tutorial notes <ul> <li>Wednesday 4:00pm.</li> </ul> Readings and Resources <ul> <li>Citizenship Act (RSC, 1985, c C-29): 13.1, 13.2, 14(1.1)(1.2), 19-20, 21, 22, 22.1, 23.1, 29.2</li> <li>Raj Sharma &amp; Aris Daghighian, Inadmissibility and Remedies (Toronto: Emond,\u202f2021): Appendix - Citizenship (Criminality, Foreign Criminality, Misrepresentation, Investigations, Suspensions) </li> <li>Non-exhaustive prohibition summary: Situations that can prevent you from becoming a Canadian citizen. </li> <li>Ministerial discretion to waive some of the prohibitions for a grant of citizenship: <ul> <li>Waiver of the application of paragraph 22(1)(b.1) of Citizenship Act</li> <li>Waiver of the application of subsection\u202f22(4): prohibitions \u2013 acts against Canada\u2019s national interests </li> </ul> </li> <li>Procedures <ul> <li>Abandonment</li> <li>Suspending applications</li> <li>Multiple applications</li> <li>Withdrawal of applications</li> </ul> </li> <li>Suspensions and mandamus<ul> <li>Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Nilam, 2017 FCA 44</li> <li>Gentile v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2020 FC 452</li> <li>Sharafaldin v.

The clock starts from the conviction date not the date the sentence is compete, which is one important way the Citizenship Act differs from IRPA. </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Vuong was convicted of an indictable criminal offence five years ago, for which he received a two-year term of imprisonment and is currently on probation. When can Vuong apply again for citizenship? </p> <ul> <li> Voung can apply now since it has been more than four years since the date of the his conviction. </li> <li> Vuong can only apply four years after the completion of his sentence.</li> <li> Vuong can apply when his probation is complete.</li> <li> Vuong must first receive a pardon or record suspension. <p>While Vuong is prohibited from applying for citizenship under s. 22(2) for four years after the date of conviction, there is a separate prohibition to applying for citizenship while still on probation or parole under s. 22(1)(a) of the Act. Note also that unlike under IRPA, a record suspension is not required in order to cure an inadmissibility for a Canadian conviction. </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Joel's citizenship application was recently refused based on a finding that he misrepresented or withheld material circumstances relating to a relevant matter, namely by failing to disclose a prior criminal conviction on his application. For how long is Joel prohibited from applying for citizenship? </p> <ul> <li> Five years</li> <li> Four years</li> <li> Ten years</li> <li> Until his criminal conviction his pardoned or received a record suspension <p>Pursuant to s. 22(1)(e.2) of the Act, an individual is prohibited from applying for citizenship for a period of five (5) years after their application is refused based on a finding of misrepresentation under s. 22(1)(e.1). Note, this penalty is unrelated to any prohibition related to the criminal conviction itself in this case.  Note also that the prohibition doubles to ten (10) years if the misrepresentation is discovered after citizenship has been granted and citizenship is revoked for that reason. Therefore, the penalty differs depending on at what stage the misrepresentation is discovered and acted upon by IRCC.  </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Dina lived in Canada as a permanent resident for ten years working for Bell Canada. In 2014, she was sent abroad to Greece for a one-year work assignment. Unfortunately, upon returning to Canada in 2015, she was convicted of a criminal offence by way of indictment and served a term of imprisonment of one year followed by one year parole. When, approximately, is the earliest she can apply for citizenship? </p> <ul> <li> 2019, four years after she was convicted</li> <li> 2021, four years after she completed her sentence</li> <li> 2020, four years after she completed her term of imprisonment</li> <li> 2020, assuming she has acquired three years (1095) days of residency in the last five-year period  <p>Dina's prohibition under s. 22(2) of the Act will expire four years after her conviction, by 2019. However, under s. 21, she cannot count her term of imprisonment or parole time (2015-2017) as part of her residency calculation. Accordingly, she must wait until at least 2020 to accumulate sufficient residency days, counting back five years not including her imprisonment and parole. </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>For how long can the Minister suspend a citizenship application to receive any information or evidence or the results of any investigation or inquiry for the purpose of ascertaining whether the applicant meets the requirements under the Act? </p> <ul> <li> For up to 6 months</li> <li> As long as is reasonable</li> <li> As long as is necessary</li> <li> Indefinitely <p>Under the prior version of the Act, the Minister could only suspend an application for up to 6 months under certain circumstances (see the cases of Stanizai and Magalong referenced in your readings). However, with the enactment of Bill C-24, s. 13.1 of the Act allows suspension \"for as long as is necessary\", which was intended to afford the Minister broad latitude and has been interpreted as such by the Courts. However, Courts have also held the language does not allow indefinite suspension as it must still be limited to some extent by what is reasonable in the circumstances (see Gentile v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2020 FC 452).</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Jo-Ann recently received a negative decision on her citizenship application. She is seeking your advice as to her available options of appealing or challenging the decision. What option is available to her? </p> <ul> <li> She can file an appeal with IRCC to have the case considered by a Citizenship Judge.</li> <li> She can file for judicial review in Federal Court within 15 days. </li> <li> She can file for judicial review in Federal Court within 30 days. </li> <li> She can file an appeal with the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) of the IRB.   <p>Pursuant to s. 22.1 of the Act, she has 30 days to file for judicial review from the date she was notified or made aware of the decision (practically, counting from the date of the decision itself is the safest option unless there is a major discrepancy).  Note, that this differs from the 15 days timeline under the IRPA and the two should not be conflated.  There is no appeal option with the IRB. The IRB does not have jurisdiction over citizenship matters and there is no formal internal appeal with IRCC. While consultants do not practice in Federal Court it is important to know these possibilities and the timelines therefor so as to be able to properly advise clients of their available options. </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Recently, Amir's counsel received a procedural fairness letter regarding Amir's citizenship application, which requested additional documents to corroborate Amir's residency. Amir has indicated that he does not have any further documents and directed his counsel to simply ignore the request and not respond within the 30 days provided or at all. Which of the following is the most likely outcome? </p> <ul> <li> Amir's application will be decided on the basis of the information and evidence available.</li> <li> Amir's application will be refused. </li> <li> Amir's application will be suspended.</li> <li> Amir's application will be declared abandoned.   <p>Pursuant to s. 13.2 of the Act, it is most likely Amir's application will be declared abandoned for failure to respond to the Minister in the time requested. Even if Amir responds but states that he is not providing the documents requested, the Minister may still declare the application abandoned unless Amir and his counsel provide a sufficient reasonable justification for being unable to produce the documents at issue (see Zhao v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2016 FC 207). This is different and potentially worse than a refusal because the Minister will not attempt to make a decision as to residency based on the information and documents already provided, which could then be subject to judicial review on the reasonableness of the analysis. </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Two years ago, Sally was convicted in Canada of a drug related offence punishable by way of indictment under the Criminal Code. Five months ago, Sally was charged in Ireland with a similar offence that if committed in Canada could constitute an indictable offence; the charge has yet to be adjudicated. Which of the following is true? </p> <ul> <li> Sally can apply for citizenship and ask the Minister for compassionate consideration to overcome her prior criminal history given that they were non-violent offences stemming from a drug addiction, for which she has since successfully completed an extensive rehabilitation program. </li> <li> Sally can ask the Minister for compassionate consideration to overcome the charge in Ireland but not the Canadian conviction.</li> <li> Sally can ask the Minister for compassionate consideration to overcome the Canadian conviction but not the charge in Ireland.</li> <li> Sally cannot ask for any compassionate consideration under the Citizenship Act as s. 25 of the IRPA does not apply.  <p>Section 22(1.1) of the Act specifically provides for a potential waiver from the applicability of section 22(1)(b.1) on compassionate grounds. This also serves to highlight how little discretion the minister is allowed with respect to the application of all other provisions regardless of any possible humanitarian factors and unlike the wide latitude afforded by s. 25 of IRPA.</p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Joe applied for citizenship one year ago. At the time he submitted his application and when it was received by the IRCC, he was fully eligible for Canadian citizenship. His application was subsequently approved and he is scheduled to take his oath of citizenship next week. Yesterday, he was charged for robbery under s. 343 of the Criminal Code of Canada, but he has not yet been convicted or had his first hearing. Can Joe proceed to take the oath of citizenship as scheduled? </p> <ul> <li> Yes, because he was fully eligible for citizenship at the time his application was submitted and approved; it is therefore locked in. </li> <li> Yes, because he has only been charged and has not been convicted of any offence. </li> <li> No, because he has been charged with an indictable offence under the Criminal Code. </li> <li> Yes, because the Minister may suspend his application but has not done so.  <p>Pursuant to s. 22(6) of the Act, a person shall not take the oath of citizenship if they never met or they no longer meet the requirements for the grant of citizenship. Section 22(b) prohibits anyone from citizenship who is not just convicted but also \"while the person is charged with, on trial for, subject to or a party to an appeal\" relating to an indicatable offence under an Act of Parliament.  </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Mark was convicted of a securities related offence in the United States two years ago, which could be treated as an indictable offence if committed in Canada. However, since that time, Mark was able to receive a full and unconditional Presidential Pardon, that completely sets aside the punishment for the federal crime. Assuming he meets all other requirements, is Mark now eligible to apply for Canadian citizenship? </p> <ul> <li> Yes, because he received a full foreign pardon that extinguished his conviction in the jurisdiction where he was convicted, further to the U.S. Constitution. </li> <li> No, because the Presidential Pardon is not the same as a Court expungement. </li> <li> No, because he is prohibited regardless of whether he was pardoned or otherwise granted amnesty for the offence.</li> <li> Yes, because the Presidential Pardon has the effect of erasing the conviction as it never existed.  <p>Further to s. 22(3) of the Act, and individual is prohibited from citizenship for a period of four years if the person has been convicted of an offence outside Canada that, if committed in Canada, would constitute an indictable offence under any Act of Parliament, regardless of whether the person was pardoned or otherwise granted amnesty for the offence. This is one of the ways in which the Citizenship Act differs and diverges from admissibility in the immigration context under the IRPA. </p> </li> </ul> </li> </ol>","tags":["ICL880","Notes","Quizzes"]},{"location":"immigration/880/ICL880week4/","title":"Module 4 - Revocations, Renunciations, and Resumptions","text":"","tags":["ICL880","Notes","Quizzes"]},{"location":"immigration/880/ICL880week4/#notes","title":"Notes","text":"Tutorial notes <ul> <li>Wednesday 4:00pm.</li> </ul> Readings and Resources <ul> <li>Citizenship Act (R.S.C., 1985, c.

That is, the Court must be satisfied that an event or fact in dispute is not only possible, but probable (Rogan v Canada (MCI), 2011 FC 1007 [Rogan] at paras. 27-29.).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Materiality<ul> <li>A misrepresentation of a material fact includes an untruth, the withholding of truthful information, or a misleading answer which has the effect of foreclosing or averting further inquiries (Canada v Brooks, 1973 CanLII 5 (SCC) at 873).</li> <li>The material character of the concealed facts depends on \u201cthe significance for purposes of the decision in question of the information not disclosed\u201d (Odynsky, 2001 FCT 138 at para. 156)</li> <li>The Minister is not required to prove the false representation, fraud, or knowing concealment of material circumstances would necessarily have led to the rejection of the application for citizenship or permanent residence, but merely that it had the effect of foreclosing or averting further inquiries, even if those inquiries would not have necessarily led to a refusal (Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Rogan, 2011 FC 1007 at para. 31).</li> <li>Innocent misrepresentations are not to result in the revocation of citizenship.\u201d (Canada v. Schneeberger, 2003 FC 970 at paras. 25-26; Rogan, 2011 FC 1007 at paras 32-35).</li> <li>Likewise, the element of \u201cmateriality\u201d does not include inadvertent omissions of immaterial information and mere technical transgressions. (Canada (MCI) v Kljajic, 2020 FC 570 at para. 95)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Mens Rea<ul> <li>The Minister must have established the individual acted intentionally by deliberately concealing material circumstances or making false representations with the intent to mislead the decision-maker (Canada (MCI) v Savic, 2014 FC 523 at paras. 66-76). This mens rea applies equally to the current formulation of s. 10.1(1) (Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Rubuga, 2015 FC 1073 at para. 76)</li> <li>This mens rea differs from misrepresentation under section 22 (prohibition from applying for citizenship) of the Act or section 40 of IRPA, which do not require intent to mislead and encompass even unintentional, inadvertent, or indirect misrepresentations.</li> <li>In situations where a parent signs the application for a minor child, any allegation must pertain to the acts or omissions of the parent and thus, the child does not have to intend to mislead the decision-maker (Canada (MCI) v Zakaria, 2014 FC 864 at para. 84).</li> </ul> </li> <li>The step-by-step process<ul> <li>Step 1: A \u201cRequest for Information\u201d letter is sent, including bare basics of the allegation and providing an opportunity to respond. It is a strategic decision whether to provide substantive submissions at this stage or wait for the formal Notice of Intent to Revoke Citizenship.</li> <li>Step 2: A \"Notice of Intent to Revoke Citizenship\" is issued per the requirements set out in s. 10(3) of the Act. The Notice must set out the specific grounds and reasons for revocation, including reference to materials, on which the Minister is relying to make their decision.<ul> <li>The Notice of Intent is usually sent as comprehensive package containing all evidence the Minister relies upon for the allegation.</li> <li>The citizen is given 60 days to respond, but extensions can be granted.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Step 3: In response, the citizen has two options:<ul> <li>To request that the Minister make the final decision taking personal circumstances into consideration such as, but not limited to, the best interests of a child directly affected (s 10(3.1)). or</li> <li>If not, the default is that the citizen is entitled to a full hearing before Federal Court on the merits of the allegation (s 10.1(1)). At the conclusion of the hearing, a judge of the Federal Court will decide whether the Minister has met the burden to prove their case on a balance of probabilities.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Note that the request for the Minister to make the final decision can include both arguments on the merits of the allegation (e.g. whether the facts in question were false or sufficiently material), as well a consideration of personal circumstances including an H&amp;C-type package of compassionate submissions and supporting documents regarding establishment, best interests of the child, etc.<ul> <li>Note also that the exact scope of discretion and factors under consideration are currently in contention \u2013 see this week\u2019s video with Laura Best and the recent decision in:  Xu v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2021 FC 1248.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Consequences<ul> <li>A person under revocation proceedings remains entitled to all rights and privileges of Canadian citizenship (including passport and travel) until and if their citizenship is revoked.</li> <li>If citizenship is revoked due to false representation or fraud or knowingly concealing material circumstances with respect to the citizenship application/process (e.g., lying about residence in Canada during the relevant period), the person becomes a permanent resident as per s. 46(2) of IRPA.</li> <li>If citizenship is revoked on the grounds they became a permanent resident by false representation or fraud or knowingly concealed material circumstances, the person will revert to foreign national status as per s. 46(2) of IRPA.</li> <li>In addition, following revocation, the person is barred for 10 years from applying for citizenship under s. 22(1)(f) of the Citizenship Act.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Renunciation and Resumption <ul> <li>Under s. 9(1) of the Act, a Canadian citizen may renounce their citizenship if they:<ul> <li>are a citizen of a country other than Canada, or, if their application is accepted, will become a citizen of a country other than Canada</li> <li>are not the subject of a declaration by the Governor in Council under section 20 (i.e. security declaration)</li> <li>are not a minor</li> <li>are not prevented from understanding the significance of renouncing citizenship by reason of having a mental disability, and</li> <li>do not reside in Canada</li> </ul> </li> <li>A waiver in the discretion of the Minister is possible on compassionate grounds for two of the above requirements, namely:<ul> <li>that the applicant understand the significance of renouncing citizenship, and</li> <li>that the applicant not reside in Canada</li> </ul> </li> <li>A former Canadian citizen may be granted resumption of citizenship under s. 11 if they:<ul> <li>submit an application</li> <li>were not the subject of an order made under section 10 (i.e. the person\u2019s citizenship was not revoked)</li> <li>are not subject to a declaration made under section 20 (i.e. security declaration)</li> <li>are not prohibited</li> <li>are not under a removal order</li> <li>have become a permanent resident within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act after having ceased to be a Canadian citizen and have no unfulfilled conditions relating to their status as a permanent resident</li> <li>have been physically present in Canada as a permanent resident for at least 365 days during the two years immediately before the date of the application, and</li> <li>met any applicable requirement under the Income Tax Act to file a return of income in respect of the taxation year immediately before the year in which the application is made</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Review of Laura Best interview <ul> <li>Part 1: Common issues and pitfalls on citizenship applications<ul> <li>What is the most common pitfall on citizenship applications? Proving residency requirements</li> <li>What's a residency questionnaire? It\u2019s a questionnaire from IRCC asking you to provide more evidence about your residency. If you provide sufficient evidence on residency requirements with the initial application, you\u2019ll save time later, because you\u2019ll skip this step.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Part 2: Latent admissibility issues<ul> <li>What are three most common types of latent admissibility issues that might be triggered by a citizenship application? Criminality, cessation, and misrepresentation</li> <li>What is cessation? The RPD may determine that refugee protection has ceased if, for example, the refugee has voluntarily traveled back and reavailed themself of the protection of their country of nationality. See IRPA s 108 (2) for other reasons for cessation.</li> <li>According to Best, what should counsel do if they discover a latent admissibility issue during the citizenship application process?<ul> <li>Be honest with your clients. You cannot misrepresent. You are ethically obligated by the professional code of conduct not to mispresent.</li> <li>There are some cases (refugee cessation and criminality) where time may resolve the issue, if not \u201ccure\u201d it. Explore whether \u201cwaiting it out\u201d may open the door to citizenship at a later date.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Part 3: Citizenship revocation<ul> <li>In what context/s can citizenship be revoked?<ul> <li>Misrepresentation on citizenship application</li> <li>Misrepresentation on PR application, even if the citizenship application was accurate</li> <li>Misrepresentation on refugee application</li> </ul> </li> <li>How does the revocation process work?<ul> <li>Step 1: IRCC is sending out a request for information letter. But these letters don\u2019t attach the evidence on which reliance is made.</li> <li>Step 2: IRCC sends out the official statutory notice with their case for revocation, evidence and a deadline for reply.</li> <li>Step 3: If your client admits they committed a material misrepresentation, they can ask for the decision to be made under the Minister's discretion. You will need to provide reasons why the Minister should use this discretion. The factors are similar to H&amp;C: establishment, etc.</li> </ul> </li> <li>What personal circumstances should the Minister consider?<ul> <li>It was not clear in Fall 2021. Three cases were at the Federal Court, where it was being decided whether circumstances in the country of origin, for example, are relevant. Two of those cases have been decided. See the following for updated information.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Addendum on citizenship revocation cases<ul> <li>Xu v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2021 FC 1102<ul> <li>In Xu, the Court found the Senior Analyst\u2019s interpretation of paragraph 10(3.1)(a) of the\u202fCitizenship Act, such that the consequences of removal are not considered among the personal circumstances warranting special relief in all of the circumstances of the case was reasonable.</li> <li>The Court agreed that a citizenship revocation decision has many parallels to the equitable humanitarian and compassionate considerations that are consider by the IAD in misrepresentation cases for permanent residents. (para. 62)</li> <li>However, the Court found those similarities do not extend to the consideration of \u2018foreign hardship\u2019 or the consequences of removal, as the IAD hears the appeal of a removal order whereas a citizenship revocation decision renders the individual a foreign national, but does not automatically result in removal. (para. 64)</li> <li>the Court notes that decision-makers in all misrepresentation cases must consider the blameworthiness of the individual, the reasons for the misrepresentation, and the extenuating circumstances thereof.</li> <li>Likewise, the Court held it is incorrect to find establishment based on misrepresentation can never be sufficient to warrant special relief, owing simply to the fact the establishment would not have been possible but for the initial misrepresentation. Such reasoning is again circular. (para. 75)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Gucake v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2022 FC 123<ul> <li>In Gucake, the Court issued a briefer decision that again upheld the Minister\u2019s Delegate\u2019s finding that consideration of removal is premature at the citizenship revocation stage.

Furthermore, the Minister must demonstrate that the representations were in fact false (which may be contestable in some cases) and that they were material inasmuch as they could have affected the process or averted avenues of inquiry.

Approximately 20 years ago, Miranda renounced her Canadian citizenship after obtaining U.S. citizenship since she lived primarily in the U.S. and wanted to limit her tax liability. Five years ago, as Miranda has been nearing the end of her career, she bought a second house in Canada and obtained PR status (after being sponsored by her husband) with the goal of eventually returning to Canada for retirement. During this time, she has maintained her PR residency requirement by living with her husband in the U.S. who has always maintained his Canadian citizenship. Last year, Miranda filed her taxes in Canada and has spent the last two summers living in her home in Canada. Is Miranda eligible to apply for a resumption of citizenship? </p> <ul> <li> Yes, because she obtained PR status and has no outstanding obligations under that status</li> <li> No, because she has not resided in Canada for at least 365 days out of the last two-year period</li> <li> No, because she has not resided in Canada for at least 1,095 days in the last five-year period</li> <li> No, because she only filed her income taxes last year and not for the last two (2) year period  </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Babak is a dual citizen of Canada and Iran. He first immigrated to Canada as a Permanent Resident when he was a minor in 2001. In 2005, the family all became citizens.

These only applied to dual citizens (even those born in Canada) who would not be rendered stateless. These provisions were repealed in 2017 with Bill C-6 on the grounds that revocation (the equivalent of exile or banishment) should not be used as a penalty for offences committed as citizen, regardless of how severe. See this week's discussion and suggested readings for more information.  </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>In relation to the question above, what would be the consequence with respect to Babak's citizenship if he was convicted of the same offence before he became a citizen? </p> <ul> <li> He would be barred from applying for citizenship for four (4) years following the date of conviction.</li> <li> He would be barred from applying for citizenship for four (4) years following the completion of his sentence.</li> <li> He would be barred from applying for citizenship for ten (10) years.</li> <li> He would be barred from applying for citizenship forever.   <p>Pursuant to s. 22(4) of the Act, there is a permanent prohibition to citizenship for individuals convicted of such offences.

She seeks help from RCIC Sandra who has a lot of questions about the situation. Sandra asks about Andrea\u2019s parents. She feels that Shiraz is trying to evade answering the question directly, instead focussing on the life she will offer to Andrea in Canada. She has plans to enrol Andrea in a very good private school and summer enrichment program. Sandra needs to know if a genuine parent-child relationship has been established between Shiraz and Andrea. To ensure that she gets the information she needs during the interview, what should Sandra do to keep the interview on track? </p> <ul> <li> Ask Shiraz to email her with additional details about the school and summer enrichment program. </li> <li> Ask to speak to Andrea's new school principal.</li> <li> Seek clarification and elaboration on only essential information about the adoption and Andrea's parents.</li> <li> Start meetings with Shiraz by reminding her of the time limit for the meeting.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>RCIC Dana previously worked as a crisis counselor in a high-risk environment where she regularly supported survivors of violence. Many of her most distressing encounters involved male perpetrators, and the trauma of those years still affects her. </p> <p>Now, as an immigration consultant, Dana feels uncomfortable working with male clients and prefers to accept only female clients into her practice. She believes this helps her feel safe and emotionally stable at work. </p> <p>Does Dana\u2019s current client preference reflect any personal or cultural bias? </p> <ul> <li> Yes, but because Dana's intention is to protect herself, it is not relevant to professional ethics.</li> <li> Yes, Dana's decision to exclude male clients based on past trauma reflects a gender-based bias that must be addressed.</li> <li> No, because Dana is not making decisions based on race or nationality, it does not count as bias.</li> <li> No, Dana is simply setting boundaries that protect her mental health and safety. <p>Dana's trauma is real and deserves care and support. However, as a regulated professional, excluding clients based on gender without a case-specific justification reflects bias and raises ethical concerns. Professionals are encouraged to seek supervision, support, or referral processes that balance their well-being with non-discriminatory service delivery. </p> </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Benji has been an RCIC for five years. He recently got divorced and his wife has custody of his two children. His practice has been struggling as he was preoccupied with the divorce and custody arrangements.

She has offered some of her personal contacts referral fees if they send her clients who later sign a retainer agreement. Is Janet\u2019s business strategy permitted under the Code of Professional Conduct? </p> <ul> <li> Yes, because the Code allows licensees to offer inducements to agents they intend to work with.</li> <li> No, because the Code prohibits a licensee from offering referral fees. </li> <li> Yes, because the Code permits licensees to accept inducements in certain situations.</li> <li> No, because the Code permits licensees to solicit inducements only from organizations, not individuals.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Sanjay is an RCIC based in Victoria, British Columbia.

Since these clients often have a long immigration journey ahead, Sanjay wants to maintain regular communication with them to provide ongoing support and build long-term client relationships. Even when clients are in the same city, meeting in person is not always feasible. </p> <p>Which combination of communication methods is the most professionally appropriate for maintaining contact with clients over time? </p> <ul> <li> Create a private Facebook group, follow clients on social media, and use direct messages to communicate.</li> <li> Send group texts through personal messaging apps, post client testimonials on social media, and check in by phone occasionally.</li> <li> Add clients on Facebook, send WhatsApp messages, and post immigration updates to Instagram stories.</li> <li> Communicate with clients by email, hold virtual meetings via Zoom for face-to-face discussions, and share immigration updates on LinkedIn.</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>RCIC Sarah was offered a job as a Regulated International Student Immigration Advisor (RISIA) at the University of Waterloo.

Applicants or their Authorized Representatives were expected to download an application package from the IRCC website, fill out all the application forms, and include copies of required and supporting documentation.  Many applications, such as those under business immigration programs, could have up to 500 pages of application forms and documents! </li> <li>In September 2012, IRCC introduced the Authorized Representative Portal, which is commonly referred to by practitioners as \u201cthe AR Portal\u201d or simply \u201cthe Portal.\u201d  The Portal allows authorized paid representatives (APR) to complete, pay for, and submit online applications on behalf of their clients. At the time, only temporary residence applications such as work permits, study permits, visitor records, or temporary resident visas could be submitted through the Portal. IRCC promised faster processing times, streamlined access to correspondence, and more.</li> <li>In January 2015, IRCC introduced a portal for submitting EE profiles and full applications. It was game-changing for IRCC and for Authorized Representatives. It did have the effect of forcing representatives to do a lot of data entry (the profile is very repetitive) and to show the client the profile means screenshots of a LOT of pages. A summary page would be great, but we don\u2019t have it as yet. </li> <li>March 2020. There was a distinct difference in service delivery standards between paper-based applications and electronic applications.  For this reason, among others, IRCC has worked hard to push through the use of online application methods, especially in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since March 2020, IRCC has digitized citizenship tests, moved citizenship ceremonies online, and launched an online \u201clanding\u201d process, which eliminated the need for approved permanent residents to be subjected to in-person landing interviews. </li> <li>By 2022, IRCC introduced at least six additional online portals to receive and manage applications.<ul> <li>The PR Application Portal was introduced to the public in March 2021 and opened for authorized representatives in September 2021.  This Portal now processes all previously paper-based permanent residence applications.</li> <li>The Employer Portal was introduced between 2014 and 2015 to allow Canadian employers to submit their job offers directly to IRCC, for LMIA-exempt work permits. </li> <li>The TR-to-PR Pathway Portal was only open between May 5, 2021 and November 4, 2021 to receive and process applications that were received through that particular pathway program.</li> <li>The Citizenship Portal was opened in late 2021 for clients to apply for citizenship on their own.</li> <li>The Temporary Resident Visa and Study Permit Portal, which opened in mid-2021, allows representatives and applicants to submit temporary resident visas and initial study permits in a streamlined process.</li> <li>Canada Post e-Post Connect, though not technically developed by IRCC, the department is now using this portal to receive and process applications in the Hong Kong Pathway. </li> </ul> </li> <li>There are three types of accounts that authorized paid representatives (APRs) can use to complete and submit applications on behalf of their clients. The appropriate account depends on the type of application and client situation. <ul> <li>https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/partners-service-providers/authorized-paid-representatives-portal.html </li> </ul> </li> <li>Individuals must select the correct portal based on their application type. Guidance on portal selection can be found here on the IRCC page \"Sign into your account\". Examples of portals available to individual applicants include: <ul> <li>IRCC Secure Account </li> <li>IRCC Portal </li> <li>Online Citizenship Application Portal </li> <li>Permanent Residence Portal </li> </ul> </li> <li>Many practitioners are critical of IRCC\u2019s practice of developing new portals to address the individual needs of different applications, instead of developing a central, cohesive online system to manage intake and facilitate the processing of all applications.</li> </ul> Authorized Representative Portal <ul> <li>the Authorized Representative Portal (the \u201cAR Portal\u201d) was introduced in September 2012. It is currently the main portal used by practitioners to submit the following: <ul> <li>Express Entry profiles</li> <li>Permanent residence applications through Express Entry </li> <li>Temporary residence applications such as work permits, study permits, visitor status extensions, and temporary residence visas </li> <li>Electronic Travel Authorizations (eTAs)</li> <li>Health care benefits for refugees </li> </ul> </li> <li>What is unique to the AR Portal is that it is linked to IRCC\u2019s own internal client information management system, called the Global Case Management System (GCMS).  Applications submitted to IRCC through the Authorized Representative Portal is immediately linked to GCMS, which generates an \u201cacknowledgement of receipt\u201d, and a system file number immediately.</li> <li>The AR portal also allows you to link an existing client file, if you happen to be retained after the client has already begun an application on their own, or if the client wishes to change representatives. This is also unique to the AR Portal, as no other portal allows practitioners to link an existing application. Another unique feature is a list of applications you have begun on behalf of clients.</li> </ul> Employer Portal <ul> <li>Under the International Mobility Program, every Canadian employer who plans to hire a foreign worker for an LMIA-exempt, employer-specific work permit must register their company in the Employer Portal. Companies are registered using their CRA Business Number, which is unique to each business.</li> <li>Employers must submit an Offer of Employment and pay a compliance fee of $230 through the Employer Portal and obtain an \u201dOffer of Employment Number\u201d. This mandatory piece of information must be included on the application for a work permit.</li> </ul> The Permanent Residence Portal <ul> <li>Prior to the pandemic, applicants who had received approval on their applications were issued paper Confirmations of Permanent Residence documentation. Those who were residing in Canada were then instructed to exit Canada and, upon return, would have their permanent residence status \u201cconfirmed\u201d by a Canada Border Services Agency.</li> <li>In 2020, the department introduced a \u201cvirtual\u201d way for new permanent residents to become \u201clanded.\u201d This became the first iteration of the Permanent Residence Portal. Applicants were asked to submit their Unique Client Identifier (UCI) number, application file numbers, a contact email, and to confirm whether they were physically located in Canada. They were then provided with a temporary password with which to create an account on the Permanent Residence Portal. Upon signing in, they were instructed to upload a digital, passport-style photo with which IRCC would issue their Permanent Resident Cards.</li> <li>In March 2021, IRCC expanded the use of this portal to allow principal applicants to apply for permanent residence online. </li> <li>In September 2021, following this successful \u201csoft launch\u201d, the Permanent Residence Portal was made available to Authorized Representatives, and is now referred to as the \"Representative Permanent Residence (RPR) Portal.\" Since then, the RPR Portal has become the main method of submission for all previously paper-based applications.<ul> <li>Economic Programs<ul> <li>Francophone Community Immigration Pilot </li> <li>Rural Community Immigration Pilot </li> <li>Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) </li> <li>Start-Up Business Class </li> <li>Quebec Skilled Workers Program </li> <li>Quebec Selected Investor Program</li> <li>Quebec Entrepreneur Program </li> <li>Quebec Self-Employed Persons Program </li> <li>Atlantic Immigration Program </li> <li>Economic Mobility Pathways Pilot </li> <li>Federal Economic Mobility Pathways Pilot </li> </ul> </li> <li>Family Class <ul> <li>Spouse </li> <li>Common-law Partner </li> <li>Conjugal Partner </li> <li>Dependent Child </li> <li>Other Relative </li> <li>Adopted Child / Child to be Adopted in Canada </li> <li>Orphaned Sibling / Nephew / Niece / Grandchild </li> </ul> </li> <li>Refugee Program Categories <ul> <li>One-Year Window of Opportunity (OYW) </li> <li>The Private Sponsorship of Refugees (PSR) Program </li> <li>In Canada \u2013 Protected Person </li> </ul> </li> <li>Other<ul> <li>In Canada \u2013 Humanitarian and Compassionate Considerations </li> <li>Permit Holder Class </li> <li>Permanent Residence Pathways for Hong Kong Residents </li> <li>Permanent Resident Card / Permanent Resident Travel Document applications  </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>The RPR Portal is not linked to GCMS. This means that any application submitted through the RPR Portal will be placed in a queue to be manually assigned and reviewed for completion under R10 of the Regulations before an officer will assign a file number and issue an acknowledgment of receipt. However, this process has also been standardized by an identical system at IRCC, so intake management has also been expedited using the PR Portal.</li> </ul>","tags":["ICL890","Notes","Quizzes"]},{"location":"immigration/890/ICL890week10/#quizzes","title":"Quizzes","text":"Knowledge Check 10.1: Managing Client Files - Online Portals <ol> <li> <p>When is it necessary for a Canadian employer to submit an offer of employment through the Employer Portal? </p> <ul> <li> When their positive LMIA has been issued by ESDC, prior to the foreign worker's application for a work permit under the International Mobility Program. </li> <li> Prior to the Foreign Worker's application for an Open Work Permit under the International Mobility Program.</li> <li> Just after the foreign worker's application for an employer-specific work permit under the International Mobility Program.</li> <li> Prior to the Foreign Worker's application for an employer-specific work permit under the International Mobility Program. </li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>Only applications submitted in the Authorized Representative Portal will be allocated a file number immediately.</p> <ul> <li> True</li> <li> False</li> </ul> </li> <li> <p>RCIC Trudy has been retained by Wilson to assist him in his application for permanent residence under the Atlantic Immigration Program.

They avoid distractions while they are focused on a task, and they set boundaries between their personal and professional lives. Remember that your employees will follow your lead\u2014if they see you working long into the night, they will assume they must do the same. Good leaders also conduct self-assessments to check their own biases, retain awareness of their strengths and weaknesses, and encourage feedback from their employees on ways to improve in their role.</li> <li>Focus on developing others: Delegating, coaching, and mentoring are important tasks that a good leader takes seriously. They actively show empathy when coaching employees on new applications, and they oversee the completion of difficult tasks by demonstrating how it can be done. A good leader also makes training a priority in their practice, whether it is by way of ensuring everyone has the opportunity to attend educational workshops, or by seeking private training opportunities from senior practitioners for all employees.</li> <li>Strategic or creative thinking: Instead of simply instructing their employees on completing a certain type of application for a client, good leaders encourage others to suggest options where the client may also reach their immigration goals. Leaders will hold frequent office meetings and encourage employees to contribute their suggestions for improving office operations and will then implement suggestions as appropriate.</li> </ul> Mental Health Management Strategies <ul> <li>Learn to say no<ul> <li>One strategy (RCIC performance indicator 9.1.6) is to use insight into personal expertise and limitations. If you feel that you have taken on more applications than you can handle, particularly if you work alone, then refer new clients to trusted practitioners. Distinguish between the \u201cshould\u201d and \u201cmusts\u201d when deciding whether to accept a new client and when possible, decline the client if you feel that you cannot dedicate sufficient attention or focus on their application. It is important to \u201crecognize and exercise professional judgment within the limits of individual qualifications\u201d (RCIC performance indicator 6.1.4). </li> </ul> </li> <li>Pare down the tasks<ul> <li>Pending deadlines for applications and IRCC requests can be a major stressor. Prioritize the responsibilities that are important and focus on those. Ask the client if they can assist you with preparing certain documents instead of trying to complete them for them. If necessary, reach out to another practitioner for some assistance.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Create a balanced schedule<ul> <li>Decide on a work schedule and stick to it. This is especially important for newer practitioners who work alone, where you may feel like you must respond to clients quickly or put in more hours to complete applications. However, this is a recipe for burnout. Find a balance between your work and family life and set aside leisure time for social activities as well as downtime where you are not checking emails or working on a file.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Problem-solve with a different mindset<ul> <li>Two performance indicators or strategies under RCIC competency 9.1 are to use critical thinking and personal insight to consider a fresh perspective to conceive a new or original perspective or solution. If you are facing a stressful situation about an application, take half an hour to pause and regroup, listen to some music, read a few chapters of a book, or watch an episode of a show.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Accept the uncontrollable<ul> <li>In an immigration application, many things can happen beyond our control. Processing delays, policy changes, and errors made by IRCC can all be stressors. Rather than stressing out over them when they occur, focus on what you can do to rectify the situation to the best of your ability.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Exercise regularly<ul> <li>Exercise releases endorphins, which can act as a huge stress reliever. Try to exercise for 30 minutes or more each time, even if you are only doing small activities like taking a walk or a set of jumping jacks.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Connect to others<ul> <li>Our work as consultants can often be lonely, especially if you work alone. Reach out to other practitioners to discuss problems with a file, or meet them for coffee or lunch to talk about your days and other topics not related to work. In relation, the RCIC competency 6.1 recommends the following strategies:  <ul> <li>Seek feedback from clients and peers</li> <li>Seek support and assistance when needed</li> <li>Build and use collaborative relationships for development, counsel and referrals</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Learn to seek help<ul> <li>Knowing how to identify these signs is the first step to knowing when to speak to a professional for help. Unlike physical health conditions like cancer or kidney disease, there is no medical test and can accurately diagnose mental health conditions, but a professional will be able to assess your symptoms and diagnose your condition and prescribe treatment options, which can range from making lifestyle changes to therapy or medication.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Managing Conflict with Staff and Clients <ul> <li>Show empaphy<ul> <li>Only focusing on how the conflict has negatively impacted you or your team is not productive to resolving the conflict. Consider why the client (or staff member) is upset or disappointed and consider how a mistake in their file could have jeopardized their application. Express to the client that you understand the motivations behind the client\u2019s dissatisfaction. Try similar approaches for projects where a staff member is feeling the same way.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Focus on your body language<ul> <li>Keep the tone of your voice neutral and your facial expression relaxed. If you are meeting the client or staff member in person to resolve a conflict, avoid crossing your arms (which suggests aggression) and refrain from shifting in your chair.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Focus on the facts<ul> <li>If the client is dissatisfied with your file preparation process, describe in detail how the file was prepared and the effort that you have put into research. Start the conversation by outlining the facts\u2014the what, how, and why\u2014and refrain from voicing your personal opinions of the client\u2019s case. If you feel like expressing emotions, use phrases such as \u201cI feel\u2026\u201d or \u201cWhen you mention this, it caused me to feel\u2026\u201d This same approach is useful for staff and the specific project or process you are doing with them.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Allow the other person to speak<ul> <li>Your client or staff member may be dissatisfied because they feel like they are not being heard. If you have already identified an issue and are working to solve the conflict, be sure to allow the client or staff member to fully express their feelings and thoughts. Ask them for details of what they feel has happened but do not jump to defend yourself or your team. Once you have obtained a clear narrative from the client or staff member, work with them to come to a resolution that works for all parties.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Acknowledge mistakes<ul> <li>When conflict arises due to a mistake, acknowledge the mistake and accept responsibility for your part. Calmly explain what happened and provide suggestions for how you will correct the mistake and prevent it from happening in the future.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Focus on the goal<ul> <li>Sometimes the client or staff member can be so focused on the perceived errors or mistakes that they forget what the end goal is. If the situation can be resolved and the client\u2019s application was not jeopardized, then emphasize that fact. Ask if you can move forward with continuing the application and re-establish your expertise on the matter and your commitment to the client\u2019s application.</li> </ul> </li> </ul>","tags":["ICL890","Notes","Quizzes"]},{"location":"immigration/890/ICL890week11/#quizzes","title":"Quizzes","text":"Knowledge Check 11.1: Career Development and Leadership <ol> <li> <p>RCIC Lara and two of her classmates from her graduate diploma program have decided to start a business together.

As a result, there is officer review of all applications. If an officer encounters information in the course of their admissibility assessment that may affect the positive eligibility determination, they may revisit the eligibility determination of an application.

The letters in the CREAC acronym stand for: Conclusion, Rule (or law), Explanation, Application, and Conclusion.</li> <li>As you'll recall, one of the most powerful pieces of evidence included with an H&amp;C application is the applicant's affidavit. An\u202faffidavit is sworn testimony presented in writing. In an affidavit, the client tells their story in their own words. They describe the relevant situations and experiences that have led them to this application. But even the affidavit - evidence itself - may require additional supporting evidence such as birth and marriage certificates, medical records, and letters of support that corroborate the events described or asserted.</li> <li>In more complex submissions, however, your CREAC structure might be more flexible, even though it is still discernible. For example, you may wish to present detailed background information about your client.</li> </ul> CREAC examples <ul> <li>Mei Lin's Case: Your client Mei Lin Wong is a 29-year-old permanent resident of Canada, originally from Malaysia. She immigrated to Canada with her family in 2013. Mei Lin received her first permanent resident (PR) card on September 15, 2014. The last time she renewed her PR card was five years ago. Over the past decade, Mei Lin has maintained continuous residence in Canada, only occasionally leaving for short trips to visit family in Malaysia and for work-related conferences in the United States.  As September 2024 approaches, Mei Lin realized that her current PR card is nearing its expiry date. Knowing the importance of maintaining valid documentation, Mei Lin has come to you and asked whether she is likely to be able to renew her card based on the forgoing information. Issue: Whether Mei Lin is eligible to renew her PR card.<ul> <li>Based on the facts provided, Mei Lin is likely able to renew her PR card. </li> <li>The Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations  (SOR/2002-227) subsection 54(1) [IRPR] establishes that PR cards are valid for 5 years from date of issue. In order to renew a PR card, the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA] paragraph 28(2)(a) requires 730 days of physical presence in Canada over 5 years.</li> <li>[In this case, since the legislative rule is specific, clear, and unambiguous, no Explanation is required - the legislation speaks for itself.]</li> <li>Mei Lin received her first PR card on September 15, 2014, and renewed her status five years ago, making her eligible for renewal once again as she approaches the ten-year mark (IRPA s 54(1)). Mei Lin indicates that she has maintained continuous residence in Canada, only leaving for occasional short trips. This suggests she has likely met the residency obligation of 730 days of physical presence in Canada over the past five years, as required by IRPA s 28(2)(a). </li> <li>Therefore, in light of Mei Lin's timely application and her apparent compliance with residency requirements, she is likely to be successful in renewing her permanent residence card, assuming she can provide the documentary evidence required under the Act and that no disqualifying factors are present. </li> </ul> </li> <li>Analogic reasoning: Analogic reasoning means drawing an analogy between an authority, usually a case with similar facts and legal issues, and your client\u2019s situation. This form of reasoning leverages the principle of stare decisis: cases that involve similar facts and the same legal issues should be decided the same way.</li> <li>Michael and Lucia's Case: Michael Chen has retained you to help him with a family class sponsorship. Michael is a 29-year-old Canadian citizen and is seeking to sponsor his wife, Lucia Gonzalez, a 27-year-old citizen of Mexico, for permanent residence in Canada under the spousal sponsorship program. Issue: Whether Michael and Lucia's marriage can be considered genuine in spite of the short time they have spent together. <ul> <li>Despite the short period of in-person interaction before and after marriage, Michael and Lucia's marriage is nonetheless genuine for immigration purposes.</li> <li>Section 4(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations SOR/2002-227 states that a foreign national shall not be considered a spouse if the marriage is not genuine or was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring status or privilege under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act SC 2001, c 27. </li> <li>However, in assessing the genuineness of a marriage, there are a wide variety of factors to be taken into account. For example, the court in Leroux v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2007 FC 403, relied on the Supreme Court of Canada's reasoning in M v H, [1999] 2 SCR 3, where seven non-exhaustive factors were identified for assessing the genuineness of a marriage. Further, the court in Leroux noted that these criteria \u201cmust be applied flexibly\u201d (at para 37) since they were established for couples living in Canada and should be modified for couples living in different countries (at para 23). Similarly, in Ollivierre v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2018 CanLII 102041 (CA IRB), the IAD emphasized that \"In assessing the genuineness of a relationship, the panel must draw conclusions based on the evidence as a whole, rather than focusing on a microscopic view or on only certain aspects of the evidence\" [at para 48]. </li> <li>In the case of Sandhu v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2014 FC 1061, the parties were similarly separated by geography after marriage, but kept in regular contact through calls and online messages; they also shared a bank account. The visa officer rejected the spousal sponsorship application and this was upheld by the IAD. The Federal Court however set aside the IAD's decision, noting that the Board should not have ignored \"the extensive phone records over the past five years showing daily calls between the Applicant and her husband, of the greeting cards and letters sent to each other, and of a shared bank account showing financial interdependence.\"</li> <li>While Michael and Lucia have spent limited time together, this factor alone is not determinative. As in Sandhu, where the court accepted a marriage as genuine despite limited co-habitation, Michael and Lucia's consistent online communication and financial connection are evidence of a genuine marriage. Michael's return to Canada, explained by work obligations, mirrors situations where courts have recognized that genuine couples may live apart due to compelling personal circumstances.  Any assessment of their relationship must take into account factors such as joint finances, shared goals, and the frequency and substance of the ongoing communication, rather than focusing solely on geographic co-location.</li> <li>Taking a holistic view of the evidence provided in relation to Michael and Lucia's relationship, it should be concluded that this is a genuine marriage for the purposes of the IRPR. </li> </ul> </li> <li>Policy-based reasoning: This example deals with an application for permanent residence based on humanitarian and compassionate (H&amp;C) grounds. The law in this area is heavily influenced by government policy. Although there is extensive case law that offers insight as to how decision makers should weight these factors, the factors themselves are set out at the first instance in policy documents - Operational Guidelines and processing manuals - provided by the IRCC. </li> <li>Amina's Case: Amina Farooqi, a 38-year-old citizen of Pakistan, has been living in Canada without status for seven years. Amina has now come to you and wants to apply for permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate (H&amp;C) grounds. Issue: Whether the Minister should exercise their discretion to exempt Amina from requirements of the Act and grant her permanent residence. <ul> <li>The best interests of the children affected by this application strongly support granting Amina Farooqi's application for permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate (H&amp;C) grounds.</li> <li>Section 25(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act requires that in any H&amp;C decision, the best interests of a child directly affected by the application must be taken into account. The Supreme Court of Canada confirmed this in the leading case of Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 SCR 817, where it emphasized that the best interests of any child affected by the application are a significant factor that must be given substantial weight in H&amp;C decisions.</li> <li>In Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [1999] 2 SCR 817, the Supreme Court relied on the UN Declaration of the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of the Child to find that \"the decision-maker should consider children\u2019s best interests as an important factor, give them substantial weight, and be alert, alive and sensitive to them. ...[W]here the interests of children are minimized, in a manner inconsistent with Canada\u2019s humanitarian and compassionate tradition and the Minister\u2019s guidelines, the decision will be unreasonable\" (at para 75). Based on Baker and on other relevant jurisprudence, Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has identified a set of essential factors in assessing cases involving children [you would cite the relevant policy document here]. These include the child's age, level of dependency, educational needs, linguistic and cultural connections, and the potential impact of uprooting the child from their current environment. </li> <li>In this case, there are three children directly affected by Amina's application: her 12-year-old Canadian-born daughter Zara, and her late sister's children (aged 14 and 16). All three children are Canadian Citizens by birth. None have ever been to Pakistan. Zara speaks only English. Uprooting her from her school life and community would disrupt the education and social connections that are key to her continued healthy development. For Amina's niece and nephew, who have already lost their mother, Amina's potential removal would mean losing their primary caregiver, potentially causing further emotional trauma. All three children have established lives in Canada, including educational and extracurricular activities and friendships that contribute to their well-being. Separating these children from Amina or forcing them to leave Canada would likely cause significant hardship and negatively impact their emotional, social, and educational development.</li> <li>Given the significant negative impact that denying Amina's H&amp;C application would have on the well-being and development of the three minor children affected by this application, the best interests of these children strongly favour granting Amina permanent resident status in Canada.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> Unit 2 <ul> <li>Technical correctness - including grammar, punctuation, spelling, and usage.

The Act created the \u201cCollege of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants,\u201d meant to be the new designated regulator for Immigration Consultants in Canada. </li> </ul> </li> <li>Professional Self-Regulation<ul> <li>In Canada, most professions are regulated by provincial authorities, and only a few with federal authorities like CICC.</li> <li>The concept of self-regulation is based on the model where a professional group enters into an agreement with the government to regulate the activities of its members, guided by public interest.</li> <li>There are several mechanisms that governments have introduced to keep professional regulatory bodies honest: ministerial accountability, increasing the number of government appointed members on councils and boards, and introducing agencies that have oversight over some aspects of the operations of the professional regulatory bodies.</li> </ul> </li> <li>There are three levels of regulation:<ul> <li>Registration: The least involved form of regulation is Registration, where members only need to be listed on a designated \u201cregistry.\u201d A good example would be \u201cCommissioners for Taking Oaths or Affidavits,\u201d who are duly registered with their province but are not required to receive certification from a particular vocational program.</li> <li>Certification is effectively the stamp of approval given to an individual for meeting pre-determined requirements. Certification is often associated with the exclusive use of a title or professional designation (\u201cprotection of title\u201d). An example would be the title \u201cEngineer-in-Training\u201d (EIT), which refers to Engineering graduates who have been certified to begin working officially as Engineers-in-Training under Professional Engineers.</li> <li>Licensure is one of the most restrictive forms of professional regulation, because it provides a professional group with exclusive control over who can practice a profession. Only those individuals who have met specific requirements to enter a profession are issued a \u201clicence\u201d to practice the profession or to perform certain \u201ccontrolled acts.\u201d </li> </ul> </li> <li>While the regulatory body may provide benefits to its members, its paramount purpose is to provide consumer protection.</li> <li>The primary purpose behind all regulatory body activity is to ensure the effective provision and access to professional services, not to forward the interests of the profession and its members.</li> <li>By law, the CICC has no legal authority to investigate, impose sanctions upon, or seek judicial enforcement against non-RCICs, as these individuals are not members and therefore not under the jurisdiction of the regulator. Only the CBSA and RCMP have the legal authority to investigate and prosecute individuals who are not Authorized Representatives as defined by s 91(2) of IRPA.</li> <li>The CICC, as a professional regulator, acts to oversee the practices of Canadian immigration consultants. The CICC can be thought of as the \u201cthe enforcer\u201d and/or \u201cpolice\u201d of the profession, because its role is to protect the public\u2019s interests. On the other hand, a professional association\u2019s role is to serve the interests of its members.</li> </ul> Continuing Professional Development <ul> <li>All licensees of the CICC must complete 16 hours of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) requirements each year (July 1 to June 30).</li> <li>Eligible Activities include: <ul> <li>(a) Participating in approved CPD Courses or Programs, including: Attending in-person or online, live CPD Courses or Programs that provide an opportunity to interact with colleagues and/or instructors; Reviewing a recorded CPD Course or Program and summarizing the learnings from the Approved CPD Activity; Participating in asynchronous, online CPD Courses that prompt responses throughout the learning process, such as requiring participants to respond to questions before they can move to the next module or section; and/or Participating in conference sessions, seminars, workshops, etc.; </li> <li>(b) Participating in a post-secondary educational institution Course or Program; </li> <li>(c) Teaching, including: At a post-secondary education Program accredited by the Council; Facilitating a CPD Activity for an approved CPD Provider; Facilitating a session, workshop, or seminar at an approved conference; and/or Facilitating approved group case study discussions; </li> <li>(d) Writing a book or article for publication, based on Approved Subject Matter, with or without a co-author, where the content aligns to the Essential Competencies for RCICs and Canadian immigration and citizenship consultancy; </li> <li>(e) Acting as a mentor through the Council\u2019s Mentoring Program; </li> <li>(f) Participating in Activities related to the observation of proceedings before a tribunal or court with the exception of licensees who are completing, or have completed, the Specialization Program where observing tribunal proceedings is a mandatory requirement; and </li> <li>(g) Participating in group case study discussions which, to be approved, must meet the following parameters: More than one (1) RCIC must be present; Groups cannot exceed fifteen (15) participants; and File-specific discussions are not eligible.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Licensees of CICC who are on approved leave from the profession, as well as suspended licensees, are still required to earn CPD hours during their leave.</li> <li>CPD hours may be carried over to the next calendar, up to a maximum of six hours.</li> <li>A CPD provider is an organization that offers continuing professional development events and activities to  licensees of CICC and may include non-profit organizations, government agencies, provincially accredited institutions, or other recognized regulatory bodies. Professional associations are the main provider of continuing professional development opportunities.</li> <li>College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants, \"Compliance Audit Regulation (UPDATED),\" (17 November 2021).</li> <li>As regulated Canadian immigration consultants, we are required to comply with the Code of Professional Conduct and all the regulations. We must be prepared to complete an annual audit.</li> <li>Errors and Omissions (E &amp; O) insurance is a type of professional liability insurance that protects regulated professionals against claims of inadequate work or negligent actions. This type of insurance usually covers both court costs and any settlements up to a specific amount. </li> <li>All immigration consultants are required to carry E &amp; O insurance. The E &amp; O insurance may be purchased annually through a provider identified by the CICC and is reasonably priced. The insurance through the CICC-approved E &amp; O provider has a collective amount of maximum coverage to include all participating licencees.</li> <li>For more information about the CICC-approved provider, visit the website for Smith Petrie Carr &amp; Scott Insurance Brokers Ltd.</li> </ul> CICC Complaints and Discipline Process <ul> <li>The CICC accepts and investigates complaints against licensees in two ways:<ul> <li>A member of the public or a licensee of the CICC may submit a complaint through the CICC Complaints Portal or by submitting a fully completed and signed complaint form.</li> <li>A complaint or credible claim that a licensee of CICC has committed an offence under the Code of Professional Conduct may be submitted by a federal, provincial, or municipal government department or agency, or by police or a law enforcement agency.</li> </ul> </li> <li>Stage 1: Complaints may not be made anonymously. CICC can only properly investigate a complaint and determine whether there is merit in the complaint if the complainant submits a copy of their government-issued identification. The CICC licensee who is the subject of the complaint will be given a full and fair opportunity to respond to the complaint. The regulator will work with the licensee to ensure that personal information and privacy are maintained. If consent is provided by the licensee, the CICC may share the complaint information with government authorities, including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), and the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).</li> <li>Stage 2: CICC will carefully review the complaint. They will first determine whether the complaint is against a licensed or registered member of CICC, or if they are licensed as a lawyer or paralegal, or they are an unauthorized representative.</li> <li>Stage 3: Based on CICC\u2019s review and assessment, the complaint could be closed without action, referred to the Voluntary Resolution Program, or referred to Investigations. In every case, the Complainant will be given an acknowledgment of the complaint and file number and will also be apprised of the stages of the review and assessment process.</li> <li>CICC can decline to investigate a complaint if the issues involved are so minor that it would be unfair and unreasonable to take any action, or if it has been found that the complaint was made frivolously and without merit, and it is not in the public\u2019s interest to proceed further.

Be aware of provincial rules regarding who you can represent and who pays you for services. Many new RCICs envision a dual business where they can provide both recruitment and immigration services.

Unless managed carefully, this dual business and \u201cdouble dipping\u201d of fees may cause a conflict of interest that could result in complicated legal issues that have real potential to cause irreparable damage to the RCIC, the employer, and your client. Fees for recruitment services can only be paid by employers to licensed recruitment agencies. It is illegal for a recruitment agency and/or an RCIC to demand or collect recruitment fees from a job seeker. Recruitment agencies and/or RCICs are also prohibited from demanding or holding a bond from a job seeker, even if there is a promise to refund the fee. Recruitment agencies and/or RCICs cannot direct an employer to recover costs for recruitment fees from a job seeker.</li> </ul>","tags":["ICL890","Notes","Quizzes"]},{"location":"immigration/890/ICL890week4/#quizzes","title":"Quizzes","text":"Knowledge Check 4.1: Practicing as an Immigration Consultant <ol> <li> <p>Which of the following core elements are related to sole proprietorship business models?

Goes beyond formal equality; differential treatment according to need may be required.</li> <li>Diversity: In broad terms, diversity is any dimension that can be used to differentiate groups and people from one another.

But it also includes differences in life experiences, learning and working styles, and personality types that can be engaged to achieve excellence.</li> <li>Indigenization: Indigenization is a process or action that focusses on incorporating Indigenous knowledges into approaches in recognition of the value and importance of including in the university system. An example of this usage is the Indigenization of the curriculum in many of the Queen\u2019s faculties. Indigenization is an action word, and towards this, Queen's is ensuring that Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Indigenization (EDII) are incorporated into plans across the university.</li> <li>Unconscious Biases: Unconscious (or implicit, hidden) biases are mental processes that operate outside of our consciousness, intentional awareness, or control. These can manifest as shortcuts in our brains that can lead us to make decisions based on assumptions.</li> <li>Inclusion: Inclusion is the active, intentional, and ongoing engagement with diversity, where each person is valued and provided with the opportunity to participate fully in creating a successful and thriving community. It means creating value from the distinctive skills, experiences, and perspectives of all members of our community.</li> <li>Accessibility: A general term for the degree of ease that something (e.g., device, service, physical environment, and information) can be accessed, used, and enjoyed by persons with disabilities. The term implies conscious planning, design, and/or effort to make sure something is barrier-free to persons with disabilities.

The client is extremely wealthy and is interested in investing a significant amount of capital in a Canadian start-up, which he hoped would allow him to apply for a work permit. Oona was very excited at this prospect and decided to wear a new dress and prepare a greeting gift to make a good first impression. On her way home from work, she saw a handmade and hand-carved clock in a local shop window, which featured 24-karat gold hands. She purchased the clock and had it wrapped up beautifully. However, when the client opened her gift, he became very agitated and left Oona's office without saying goodbye.

Monique is respectful and diligent in her work, and she rarely receives refusals on her applications. Her Russian clients often ask if they can refer their friends who are interested in applying under the Quebec investor program.

Both belong to the Seventh Day Adventist Church, and both are very active in their churches, Ellie in Canada, and Al in Singapore. Their wedding was performed in a Seventh Day Adventist Church. In the GCMS notes, there is no mention of this connection.

She had met and began a relationship with the applicant, an Iranian citizen, before she left Iran. They were married in New Delhi years later. The visa office in Tehran, Iran, refused the application, citing the belief that this was not a genuine marriage, because they did not take part in nikah, the traditional religious ceremony, and the bride and groom did not wear traditional Muslim wedding garments.

Listening and signaling that you understand their questions are great ways to build rapport.</li> <li>Reassure the client: If you feel that you are competent to handle the matter for the client, clearly state that you will be able to help them. Tell them your past experiences and provide some examples of similar cases, without compromising the confidentiality of your past clients.</li> <li>Tell the client what to expect: Explain how you typically work with clients so they understand what your business relationship will be like.

Under this method, clients will be billed according to the stage at which the application has progressed.\u202f For example:<ul> <li>The first payment of\u202f$____\u202fupon the execution of the service agreement\u202f(this would cover our\u202finitial\u202fconsultation\u202fand\u202fpreliminary research).</li> <li>The second\u202fand final\u202fpayment of\u202f$____ upon\u202fsubmission of\u202fthe application\u202f(this would cover file\u202fpreparation).</li> </ul> </li> <li>Dispute resolution: This mandatory clause sets out the process by which you can resolve any disputes arising from\u202fyour services.\u202fIn the event of a dispute, you are encouraged to resolve the matter between yourself and the client civilly. If the dispute cannot be resolved this way, then the client must be provided with the resources to file a complaint in writing to CICC.\u202fYour service agreement must provide the CICC\u2019s complaints and discipline procedure, or an accessible link directly to the Make a Complaint page on the CICC website.</li> <li>Force majeure: A\u202fforce majeure\u202fclause is included in all service agreements to protect your practice when extraordinary or extreme events make it difficult or impossible to continue performing the scope of your services. The clause will often refer to language such as \u201cwar,\u201d \u201cnatural disasters,\u201d or \u201cacts of God.\u201d\u202fIf such\u202fincidents beyond your control result in your inability to\u202ffulfil your obligations, you would not be found at fault.</li> <li>Changes in policy: As with force majeure, you would also not be found liable for change in policy beyond your control.

Mousa tells Leslie that this information is not required on a service agreement. Leslie disagrees and tells Mousa that he must clearly outline the scope of his services, so the service agreement must correctly identify the Visa Office.

Sahil reviews Leena's outlined scope of services and notices that Leena did not mention whether she will assist his mother with an interview at the visa office. He asks Leena to include this service in the agreement. Leena tells Sahil that in her experience, TRV applicants are rarely asked to attend an interview at the visa office. However, Leena promises Sahil that if his mother is selected by chance, she will prepare her for an interview.

Even if you wish otherwise, perhaps you can\u2019t deny that your client may not be 100% eligible for a certain program, but you still believe that the application should be approved based on certain factors. In this case, your thesis should acknowledge IRCC\u2019s perspective but still argue for your client\u2019s application to negate concerns. Highlight any humanitarian or compassionate reasons, find legal precedent where exemptions to program requirements may have been granted, or ask for administrative discretion. </li> <li>Do you disagree with IRCC\u2019s assessment? State the thesis of the letter early \u2013 to demonstrate that IRCC\u2019s assessment was not substantiated, was made in error, or breached procedural fairness </li> </ul> </li> <li>Research. Whichever angle you decide to take in your response, undertake as much background reading on the topic as you can. You should not limit yourself to only reading case law or IRPA and the Regulations. Research can involve reading medical journals, pharmaceutical research, or conducting interviews with relevant authority figures in the matter.</li> <li>Prepare your outline. Decide how many topics in your argument you would like to present \u2013 usually 3-4 topics will suffice. Each topic should clearly center around an argument with factual evidence to support each. Draft a \u201croad map\u201d to layout each topic. Move around paragraphs to ensure that the flow of your arguments makes sense. </li> <li>Write the draft using your outline. <ul> <li>Introduction </li> <li>Background of relevant facts on the application: <ul> <li>When was the application submitted? </li> <li>Which province was the client intended to settle? </li> <li>How did the client meet eligibility criteria? </li> <li>Did the client have arranged employment, if this was an economic class application? </li> <li>Did you already address the officer\u2019s potential concerns in your submission letter?   </li> </ul> </li> <li>Your thesis/angle <ul> <li>Agree with the officer? What argument are you trying to make for your client in this case? </li> <li>Disagree? Do you think the officer has made an error in their assessment or understanding of the application? </li> </ul> </li> <li>Your arguments and supporting details. Cite all sources correctly using footnotes or directly in the body of your submission </li> <li>Your conclusion, with an appendix of a list of documentation you are enclosing. Do not include links to websites for the officer to find themselves. If you want to include information from a website, save it as a PDF and include it with the application directly. This way, you can be sure that the officer will have definitely read it. </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> Application Request for Reconsideration <ul> <li>If you feel that the application was refused in error, you can submit a request for IRCC to reconsider the refusal. This should be done as soon as possible, preferably within the same business day, or no more than 1-2 business days following receipt of the refusal letter.</li> <li>Much like writing procedural fairness letters, a request for reconsideration must be based on factual evidence, with detailed arguments that substantiate your belief that an error was made. Essentially, you are arguing that the officer has made an error in the law or an error of mixed fact and law. The refusal must be a matter that would be overturned by the Immigration Appeal Division in an appeal, or at the Federal Court.</li> <li>You should follow the same process in writing this request, as you do when writing a response to a procedural fairness letter.</li> </ul> Absences <ul> <li>The Planned or Unplanned Absence Regulation defines such instances as a \u201cvoluntary closure of practice, death, incapacity, suspension or revocation, leave of absence, missing person, or extended travel outside of the country in which the Member ordinarily resides and/or works.\u201d</li> <li>Leaves of absence can include family and medical reasons, returning to full-time studies, accepting a contract with the government, or even retirement. </li> <li>An RCIC who owns an immigration or consulting practice (either as a sole proprietor or an incorporated company), must prepare a Contingency Plan that will protect their clients\u2019 files in the event of a planned or unplanned leave of absence.

A contingency plan is a backup for your original plan; it is your \"Plan B\".</li> </ul> </li> <li>As part of your continuity plan, you will need to designate someone who will be the primary contact for your clients and the regulator in the event of your absence. This person will essentially take over your practice and work on your files until you are in a position to resume work.</li> <li>A \u201cResponsible Person,\u201d in the context of a Contingency Plan, is someone who will be the primary contact for your clients and the CICC in the event of your planned or unplanned absence.</li> <li>Your contingency plan must include:<ul> <li>A system to address emergencies that may arise in your client files in the event of a Planned or Unplanned Absence from your practice</li> <li>Accurate and up-to-date information on office procedures</li> <li>Accurate and up-to-date information on other areas of your practice</li> <li>Steps to take to facilitate the transition to a new Authorized Representative (also known as the Responsible Person) </li> <li>Process to notify the Regulator in the event of incapacitation or other medical conditions, death, or declaration of being a missing person </li> </ul> </li> </ul>","tags":["ICL890","Notes","Quizzes"]},{"location":"immigration/890/ICL890week9/#quizzes","title":"Quizzes","text":"Knowledge Check 9.1: Managing Client Files <ol> <li> <p>You have been retained to submit Helen's application for permanent residence under the Family Class.

Inadmissibility due to misrepresentation under IRPA s 40 is not one of the inadmissibility grounds listed in IRPA s 25(1) that would prohibit granting H&amp;C relief; thus a positive decision is possible despite the earlier misrepresentation.

Sean has no other convictions on his record and no immigration violations. The concert is set for Massey Hall in Toronto in April. Under IRPA s 24, the officer has discretion to grant a TRP to an inadmissible person to allow them to enter Canada.</p> <p></p> <p>The key factor or factors for the officer to consider in exercising their discretion under IRPA s 24 in this case would be:</p> <ul> <li> Sean's reason for coming to Canada versus any risk he poses to the public.</li> <li> The significant benefit to Canada and the impact of cancellation on the Canadian audience.</li> <li> Under IRPA s 24(1), the only consideration is whether Sean has been rehabilitated.</li> <li> Whether the costs and difficulties Sean would suffer are unreasonable, undeserved, and disproportionate in light of a single offence. <p>The IRCC Guidelines state that a TRP under IRPA s 24 will be granted where the need for the foreign national to enter or remain in Canada is compelling and those needs outweigh any risk to Canadians or Canadian society. Hardship to Sean is not by itself a factor, nor is the impact on Canadians. Nor is there any one predominant factor. However, all circumstances can be taken into account under IRPA s 24(1) in the context of whether the reasons are compelling and assessing the risk.</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>The officer may not fetter their discretion.

As all factors may be put forth by the applicant, the officer must consider and weigh them but cannot just ignore them, as that defeats the purpose of IRPA s 24.

Monique has heard conflicting reports as to whether she will need to give biometrics and seeks your opinion.</p> <p>Will Monique be required to submit biometrics?</p> <ul> <li> Yes, because all work permit applicants require biometrics.</li> <li> No, because a US citizen does not require biometrics for any applications.</li> <li> Yes, because permanent resident (PR) applicants, including Americans, require biometrics.</li> <li> No, because she has given her fingerprints already for her FBI check. <p>All PR applicants over 14 years old and under 79 years old require biometrics. There is no exemption for Americans on PR applications, although Americans are exempt from biometrics on temporary applications. Monique would not need them for her work permit, but needs them for her PR application. The need for biometrics is unrelated to fingerprinting for police certificate purposes, she will still need to provide them again through a biometrics operator.</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Vivian is an RCIC who was informed last week by the CICC that a complaint has been made against her by a former client.

Prior to April 26, 2022, citizens of a visa-exempt country other than the U.S. required an eTa to travel to or transit through Canadian airports, but current policy states that lawful permanent residents of the U.S. do not need an eTa.

However, Eun Ha has not been paid outstanding fees for her previous services, and Lief has not been responsive to her calls and invoices.

Since coming out as gay at the age of 20, Santiago has become an outspoken leader in the LGBTQ+ activist community. He often organizes community events, manages online forums, and encourages people to share stories of discrimination and denounce government inaction. While working as an activist in Colombia, Santiago experienced a couple minor incidents of discrimination but never feared that he would be persecuted on the basis of his sexual orientation.</p> <p>During a trip to Montreal to visit his family, however, several members of his LGBTQ+ activist group are arrested and beaten during a protest. He receives news from a friend in Colombia that the police are looking for Santiago. The police made several threats that they would \"put an end\" to Santiago's activities and make him \"regret his life choices.\" Santiago fears returning home and decides to stay in Montreal. He makes an appointment with Sandra, an RCIC, for a consultation.</p> <p></p> <p>Which of the following is accurate advice for Sandra to give regarding a potential refugee claim?</p> <ul> <li> Regardless of the basis for Santiago's claim, citizens of Colombia have a high acceptance rate so it makes sense to pursue a claim.</li> <li> Santiago's refugee claim could be based on the activities that happened after he left his country and so it would be advisable for him to file a refugee claim sur place.</li> <li> Santiago did not make a refugee claim immediately upon arrival in Canada and therefore he may not be eligible to file a claim.</li> <li> Santiago does not meet the definition of a Convention refugee since he did not personally experience threats, violence, or persecution while in his home country. <p>Sandra may advise Santiago to file a refugee claim sur place. The IRB states that: \"a sur place claim is one in which a claimant alleges that they have a well-founded fear of persecution because of events that occurred after they left. A claimant may claim to be at risk because of their actions in Canada, as a consequence of events which have occurred in their country of origin since departure, or because of a significant intensification of pre-existing factors since departure.\" Reference: IRB.</p> <p>See Ghasemian v Canada (MCI), 2003 FC 1266, for an example of a sur place claim. Every potential refugee claim should be examined on its merits, regardless of the acceptance rates for that particular country of origin. Delay in making a claim does not in itself affect eligibility; it can however negatively impact the claim (subjective fear) if the claimant cannot provide a reasonable explanation for the delay.</p> <p>Note that delay should not be a factor when the claimant was legally admitted to Canada and continued to have legal status in Canada at the time they applied for refugee status.</p> <p>In this case, if an explanation is needed, delay can easily be explained since it is a sur place claim. By the very definition of sur place claim, it is not necessary for Santiago to have experienced any threats or fear of persecution while he was still in his home country.</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>If Santiago is deemed a vulnerable claimant and the Minister is not a party to the claim, what will be the order of questioning during his hearing?</p> <ul> <li> Any witness, including Santiago, will be questioned first by the Member and then by Sandra.</li> <li> Any witness, including Santiago, will be questioned first by Sandra and then by the Member.</li> <li> The Member may vary the order of questioning to accommodate Santiago.</li> <li> Only the Member may question Santiago because the Minister's representative is not present. <p>The standard order of questioning is: if the Minister is not a party, any witness, including the claimant, will be questioned first by the Member and then by the claimant's counsel (RPD Rules, 10(1)).</p> <p>However, the Member may vary the order of questioning to accommodate a vulnerable person (RPD Rules, 10(5)).</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>\u2665\ufe0f</p> <p>Nikola immigrated from Serbia and became a Canadian citizen on September 23, 2015. Recently, it was discovered that he had previously been convicted of theft in Belgrade in the late 1990s, and had served a four-year prison sentence that he completed prior to immigrating to Hamilton, Ontario. This was not initially discovered by visa officers because Nikola submitted in his application for permanent resident status a forged criminal record that he obtained by bribing a police officer. In these circumstances:</p> <ul> <li> Nikola's citizenship will be revoked, he will become a foreign national, and he will be barred from reapplying for ten years.</li> <li> Nikola's citizenship will be revoked, he will become a foreign national, and he will be permanently barred from reapplying.</li> <li> Nikola's citizenship will be revoked, he will become a permanent resident, and he may apply for citizenship according to the normal timelines.</li> <li> Nikola's citizenship will be revoked, he will become a permanent resident, and he will be barred from reapplying for ten years. <p>Citizenship Act s 10(1) allows the minister to revoke a person's citizenship if they are satisfied on a balance of probabilities that the person obtained their citizenship through false representation or by knowingly concealing material circumstances. Because Nikola's citizenship will be revoked on the grounds that he became a permanent resident by false representation or fraud, he will revert to foreign national status;</p> <p>reverting to permanent resident status applies only to an individual whose citizenship was revoked due to fraud during the citizenship process. A person who has had their citizenship revoked can never apply for resumption of citizenship, but Nikola may reapply for citizenship after ten years from the date of revocation.

One of GridWorks Innovations' existing customers, Erie Environmental Services, is an American hydrogeological services company based in Toledo, Ohio. Erie Enviromental Services is currently in Canada performing a hydrogeological assessment near Windsor, Ontario. They purchased a portable solar power system from Northfield just under three years ago. While in the field recently, one of the photovoltaic panels stopped delivering power to the backup battery. The panel was manufactured in Stuttgart, Germany; the batteries and other electrical components were manufactured in Michigan; and the software was developed in Michigan. All parts were sold with a 15-year warranty. Remote testing has not been successful at solving the problem, and Northfield would like to send Casper to Ontario identify the issue and perform the necessary repairs as stipulated in the original warranty.</p> <p>What further information would an RCIC need to know about this situation in order to determine whether Casper would be able to enter Canada under CUSMA's after-sales service provision?</p> <ul> <li> The location where the equipment was originally purchased.</li> <li> Whether Casper is employed in a managerial or executive capacity.</li> <li> Whether Erie Environmental Services would be paying for Casper's expenses.</li> <li> The citizenship status of Erie Environmental Services' employees. <p>Casper's work would fall under the after-sales service provision as long as the equipment was purchased outside of Canada.

Eleven years ago, Northfield sold an off-grid backup system to the Canadian subsidiary of an American oil and gas corporation. The sale was finalized at Northfield's storefront in Buffalo, New York; the batteries, other electrical components, and software were manufactured and developed in Michigan; and the solar panels were manufactured in Stuttgart, Germany. All components came with a ten-year warranty with options for extension; the purchasing company chose to extend the warranty one year ago for a further five-year term. At the time of the sale, Northfield was performing its own warranty work. Northfield is now dividing their warranty work between their own in-house team and a separate contracting company, Mackinac Technical, who are established in Saginaw, Michigan. The backup system now needs a major software re-installation that can only be performed with a specialist on-site at the equipment's location in Manitoba.</p> <p>Can specialists from Mackinac Technical enter Canada under CUSMA's after-sales service provision on behalf of Northfield to provide this service?</p> <ul> <li> No, because the sales agreement did not specify that a third party would perform the warranty work.</li> <li> No, because the sales agreement did not name Mackinac Technical as the firm that would perform the warranty work.</li> <li> No, because the warranty work is not pursuant to the original warranty.</li> <li> Yes. <p>To fall under the third party service section of the CUSMA after-sales service provisions, CUSMA requires that the sales agreement contain clear wording that a third party will perform the installation, warranty, or service work. It does not require the third party firm providing the service to be named in the sales agreement.</p> <p>It permits the initial warranty or service agreement to be extended provided that the initial warranty or service agreement contained a provision allowing for that extension.</p> <p>Because the original sales agreement did not contain a provision specifying that a third party would be performing the warranty work, Northfield would not be able to rely on CUSMA's after-sales service provisions to send technicians from Mackinac Technical to Canada to perform this work.

Shortly after coming to Canada, Marie discovered that Noah was having an affair with Ursula, an international student at Carleton University. The couple immediately made plans to divorce. Marie moved out of their condo on October 2, 2022, and their divorce was finalized a little over a year later. Noah and Ursula got engaged on December 31, 2023, and Noah retained Gerald, an RCIC in Ottawa, to ask about sponsoring Ursula as his new spouse when they marry.

In this case, Parhim cannot sponsor Shahiza until five years have passed since he became a permanent resident (that is, February 28, 2026). As a permanent resident, Parhim must be living in Canada to become a sponsor.

At the age of 19, Carolina moved from Mexico to Belgium to pursue her post-secondary studies. After graduating, she was able to start working and access social services including healthcare. She remained in Belgium for three years before moving back to Mexico to be closer to her family. After returning to Mexico, Carolina developed an intimate relationship with Ernesto, a young lawyer, whom she met online. Ernesto was kind and romantic at first, but he quickly became controlling and abusive. He withheld money from her, and so she had to resort to shoplifting to feed herself. After just six months together, Carolina had endured frequent beatings and ended up hospitalized twice as a result of Ernesto's physical abuse. Ernesto also threatened Carolina, telling her that if she tried to leave he would have her killed. In July 2023, Carolina decided to report him to the police. When they took no action, she became afraid of him finding out that she went to the police, and fearing for her life, she decided to flee. She could return to Belgium and restore her status in that country, but she decided she would go to Canada instead since she has family in Vancouver. Unfortunately, she didn't have enough money or a valid passport for the flight, so she ended up having to wait before leaving Mexico. She finally arrived in Canada and made a refugee claim at a port of entry on June 9, 2024. A week after arriving, she learned that Ernesto had been killed in a car accident.</p> <p></p> <p>\u2665\ufe0f</p> <p>If on June 15, 2024, Carolina's claim is found to be eligible and is referred to the RPD, her hearing must take place by:</p> <ul> <li> July 31, 2024.</li> <li> August 14, 2024.</li> <li> July 17, 2024.</li> <li> Carolina is not eligible to make a claim because she lived in Belgium, a safe third country, for three years. <p>The correct date is August 14, 2024. The hearing must be set within 60 days after the date on which the claim is referred, regardless of whether it was made at a port of entry or at another place inside Canada. (IRPA s 111.1(1)(b) &amp; 111.1(2); IRPR r 159.9(1)(a)(ii)).</p> <p>It is not correct that Carolina is not eligible to make a claim because she lived in Belgium, a safe third country, for 3 years. Only the US is currently designated as a safe third country under the Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA). If she arrived directly from a safe third country (the US), her claim might be ineligible to be referred to the RPD. The existence of an Article 1E country (Belgium), however, does not render the claim ineligible to be referred to the RPD. She could be excluded under Article 1E if the RPD determines that she can return to Belgium to live safely and has the same basic rights and obligations as the nationals of that country. Note that the Safe Third Country Agreement is currently being challenged in court. As of this update in December 2024, the Safe Third Country Agreement remains in effect.</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>\u2665\ufe0f</p> <p>All of the following are issues that might be raised by the RPD except:</p> <ul> <li> Delay and lack of subjective fear.</li> <li> Exclusion under Article 1E.</li> <li> Cessation.</li> <li> Nexus to one of the five Convention grounds. <p>This is a gender-based claim, meaning there is a nexus to membership in a particular social group, as detailed in Chairperson Guideline 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution. E.g, women who fear acts of violence at the hands of private citizens from whose actions the state is unwilling or unable to adequately protect. Reference: Chairperson Guideline 4.</p> <p>Delay and lack of subjective fear: The Supreme Court of Canada's decision in Canada (Attorney General) v Ward sets out that the claimant's fear must have both a subjective and objective basis. The fact that Carolina delayed in leaving could be raised as an issue, indicating that she did not have a genuine (subjective) fear. Reference: Canada (Attorney General) v Ward.</p> <p>Exclusion under Article 1E: Belgium could be considered an Article 1E country because Carolina can return there, live safely there, and has the same basic rights as the nationals of that country (right to work, study, access to social services). Reference: IRB.</p> <p>Cessation: there has been a substantial, effective, and durable change of circumstances which removes the basis of fear of persecution (IRPA, s 108(e)).</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>If Carolina's refugee claim is denied and found to have no credible basis, which of the following is true?</p> <ul> <li> She can appeal to the RAD within 15 days.</li> <li> She can apply for leave for judicial review to the Federal Court within 15 days.</li> <li> She can appeal to the IAD within 30 days.</li> <li> She can appeal to the RAD within 30 days. <p>Carolina may apply for leave for judicial review to the Federal Court within 15 days. A person can apply for judicial review for any determination made under the IRPA provided that any right of appeal under the IRPA is exhausted. This is the case here. Notice of application for judicial review must be made to the Federal Court within 15 days of when the applicant was notified of the decision in Canada (IRPA s 72(2)(b)).</p> <p>Carolina may not appeal to the RAD because the claim was found to have no credible basis (IRPA s 110(2)(c)).

They seized several fake passports and travel documents that were found in the glove compartment and had different names on them. In these circumstances, which of the following is true?</p> <ul> <li> Andy breached Giacomo's Charter s 8 rights because Giacomo did not consent to the search of his vehicle.</li> <li> Andy breached Giacomo's Charter s 8 rights because Andy did not have a warrant to search the vehicle.</li> <li> Andy acted within his appropriate authority.</li> <li> Charter s 8 rights do not apply to Giacomo because he is not a Canadian citizen or permanent resident. <p>Charter s 8 rights apply to all persons in Canada, including foreign nationals.

Which of the following is the most correct method for Albert to keep his clients' files organized and safe?</p> <ul> <li> Labelling his files utilizing a numerical method and storing them in a fireproof locked filing cabinet.</li> <li> Labelling his files by date organized in chronological order in a locked file cabinet.</li> <li> Labelling his files utilizing an alphabetical method and storing them in banker boxes at the reception area.</li> <li> Labelling his files utilizing an alphabetical method and storing them in a file cabinet located in his office. <p>The Client File Management Regulations require members to employ a clear and coherent system to label and identify client property. Albert can utilize a numerical labeling method to organize his clients' files. Furthermore, storing his clients' files in a fireproof locked filing cabinet complies with the requirement to store client records in a physically secure manner as outlined in s 6.1 of the Client File Management Regulation. </p> <p>Labeling his files by date organized in chronological order in a locked file cabinet: this answer is incorrect. Labeling his clients' files by date only is not sufficient to clearly identify clients' property. Members are also required to store active files separately from closed files per s 5.4 of the Client File Management Regulations. </p> <p>Labeling his files utilizing an alphabetical method and storing them in banker boxes at the reception area: this answer is incorrect. Storing clients' files in banker boxes at the reception is not secure, as such area is open to the public and as a result is contrary to s 6.1 of the Client File Management Regulation. </p> <p>Labeling his files utilizing an alphabetical method and storing them in a file cabinet located in his office: this answer is incorrect. An unlocked file cabinet that is not fireproof is not secure, contrary to the criteria outlined in s 6.1 of the Client File Management Regulation.</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Albert has been an immigration consultant since the 1990s.

His wife immigrated with him 20 years ago, but they are now divorced. He recently got re-married to Mai, a 22-year-old citizen of Vietnam who he met through her relatives in Edmonton. Jay travelled to Vietnam for the wedding and a second time to visit her. He occasionally sends money for her support. After interviewing Mai, the visa officer found the marriage was not genuine, but was entered into solely to gain immigration status in Canada. Jay has filed an appeal to the IAD. While waiting for the appeal hearing, Mai gives birth to their child. </p> <p></p> <p>Does Jay have a right to introduce evidence of the baby's birth at the appeal hearing?</p> <ul> <li> No, because the IAD can only consider evidence which was before the officer when the decision was made.</li> <li> Yes, because the IAD can consider new evidence that arose after the refusal.</li> <li> No, Jay has no right to introduce the new evidence, but the panel member has discretion to allow it.</li> <li> No, because the matter involves a possible fraudulent marriage, so the birth is not relevant. <p>An IAD hearing is an appeal de novo, meaning that the facts and law will be re-considered and assessed at the time the appeal is disposed of; thus, new evidence is admissible. This is the opposite of the rule for judicial review in Federal Court, where only evidence that was before the officer when the decision was made can be considered by the court. As the appellant has a right to prove the facts as they exist at the time of the hearing, he can introduce any new evidence that arose after the officer's refusal. He need not rely on the panel member's discretion in this regard. A baby is very relevant to genuineness of a marriage and would be a significant, although not determinative, factor.

Reference: IRPA s 67(1). </p> <p>Reasonableness would be the test for determining the genuineness of a marriage on judicial review, not at the IAD. Insufficient reasons will not generally constitute a breach of natural justice, so some other breach would need to be relied on, for example, if the officer refused to allow Mai to have a translator at the interview. </p> <p>Whether the IAD panel member disagrees with the officer's decision is not relevant unless grounds under IRPA s 67(1) are found.</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>If Jay seeks an adjournment of the hearing due to his wife's health, the requirements of natural justice would mean that:</p> <ul> <li> Jay has a right to obtain an adjournment provided he has legitimate reasons.</li> <li> An adjournment would only be granted by the IAD panel member where the Minister's counsel was in agreement.</li> <li> Jay has the right to request an adjournment from the Minister's counsel; any agreement between them is binding on the panel.</li> <li> The IAD panel member would consider a request for an adjournment made in accordance with the rules, and exercise their discretion. <p>Natural justice does not dictate any specific result, but goes to the process of decision-making that is fair to both parties. The request is made to the panel as the decision-maker, not to the Minister's counsel. Jay's reasons may be legitimate, but other operational factors are also taken into account, such as availability of hearing officers. The IRB notes that postponement requests are granted only in exceptional circumstances. The panel member must be fair to both parties in rendering the decision, but there is no requirement that the parties agree. Reference: IRB.</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>If Jay loses at the IAD and wishes to apply to the Federal Court for judicial review, the standard of review the judge will apply is:</p> <ul> <li> Whether the IAD panel member's decision that the marriage was not genuine was correct, based on the facts and the law.</li> <li> Whether the visa officer's decision that the marriage was not genuine was correct, based on the facts and the law.</li> <li> Whether the IAD panel member's decision that the marriage was not genuine was reasonable.</li> <li> Whether the visa officer's decision that the marriage was not genuine was reasonable. <p>The matter of whether a marriage is genuine is a question of fact.

Reference: Kehn v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2020 FC 615.

Just over a decade ago, she completed a graduate degree in Germany and obtained permanent resident status in that country. She then returned to India, and a year later, she married Vijay, a local entrepreneur. Vijay was an abusive partner, and he physically and sexually abused Mandeep on a regular basis. </p> <p>Last year, Mandeep travelled to Calgary to visit her cousins. During her trip, she disclosed her situation to a trusted family member who then persuaded her to stay in Canada. Mandeep consulted Anahita, an RCIC who works at a local immigration firm. After advising Mandeep of her options, Anahita made the recommendation that Mandeep should file a refugee claim. </p> <p>In February, Mandeep made a refugee application on the basis that she fears gender-related persecution. Mandeep did not disclose the fact that she has permanent resident status in Germany because she did not think it was relevant to her claim. </p> <p>As Anahita prepares Mandeep for the hearing, it becomes quickly obvious that the domestic abuse was extremely traumatic for Mandeep and that she is under a tremendous amount of stress. As a result, Mandeep is having difficulty remembering the details of events that occurred in India. Anahita is very worried her claim will be refused because of this issue. </p> <p></p> <p>Which of the following can Anahita not do in preparing Mandeep to testify at the RPD hearing?</p> <ul> <li> Explain to her that you may be able to change the order of questioning to better accommodate her situation.</li> <li> Advise her to pick one version of events (the version detailed in her BOC) and to stick with it.</li> <li> Advise her to say that she \"does not remember\" when she is asked about details that she does not remember.</li> <li> Advise her she can refer the RPD to her BOC or a corroborating document, if she thinks the correct details are listed there that she does not remember. <p>Many refugee claimants who have experienced trauma suffer from PTSD and have difficulty remembering certain events, details, and even dates. While it is important to provide testimony that is consistent with the documentary evidence (including the BOC), you must advise your client to answer questions candidly and honestly.

The RPD may, on application by the Minister, vacate a decision to allow a claim for refugee protection, if it finds that the decision was obtained as a result of directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter (IRPA s 109(1)). If the application is allowed, refugee status is lost (IRPA s 109(3)). </p> <p>The RPD has no jurisdiction to review a decision, and must conclude in its initial decision whether a claim is manifestly unfounded or has no credible basis (IRPA s 107(2), 107.1). </p> <p>No appeal to the RAD is available if the decision is vacated (IRPA s 110(2)(f)).</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>Tam Nguyen is an RCIC in Richmond, British Columbia, who has many clients in the local Vietnamese community.

Yuling is 44 years old and has a 17-year-old daughter, Mei. In 2011, Yuling began practicing Falun Gong, and over the course of several years, Yuling and Mei received numerous threats from authorities as a result of her spiritual practice. Last year, Yuling and other Falun Gong practitioners led a small protest against the government. Yuling was detained at the protest and sent to a forced labour camp. After six months of being in detention, Yuling managed to escape the labour camp. In her escape, she injured a security guard and left him paralyzed. Fearing for her and Mei's safety, she decided to flee the country with her daughter. She quickly sought out the help of a smuggler to assist them in obtaining false documents and arranging transit to Canada. After a difficult and roundabout journey, Yuling and Mei arrived at the Toronto airport with several other Chinese citizens who were also seeking asylum. Upon arrival, Yuling, Mei, and the others were designated as irregular arrivals. </p> <p></p> <p>\u2665\ufe0f</p> <p>Which of the following is true?</p> <ul> <li> Yuling will be automatically detained.</li> <li> Yuling and Mei will not be eligible to make a refugee claim.</li> <li> Yuling and Mei will be automatically detained.</li> <li> Yuling and Mei will be eligible to make a refugee claim in 12 months. <p>Yuling and Mei will be subject to automatic detention (IRPA s 55(3.1)(a)) because they are designated foreign nationals (DFNs). Any DFN 16 years of age or older is automatically detained on their entry into Canada. Being DFNs does not preclude them from making a refugee claim, and there is no 12-month bar.</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>If Yuling and Mei's refugee claim is heard, which of the following is an issue that is likely to be raised by the RPD during the hearing?</p> <ul> <li> The availability of state protection.</li> <li> Nexus to one of the five Convention grounds.</li> <li> Exclusion based on Article 1F(b).</li> <li> The use of false documents to enter Canada. <p>Exclusion based on Article 1F(b) is correct. A refugee claimant will be excluded under Article 1F(b) and IRPA s 98 if it is determined that she committed a serious non-political crime outside the country of refuge. There is a presumption of \"seriousness\" if the crime involves wounding, homicide, etc. (see Febles). In assessing the seriousness of the crime, the RPD also has to evaluate the facts, any mitigating/aggravating circumstances, etc. (see Jayasekara). Here the RPD would have to determine if the crime was serious and if it was non-political (see Febles for \"non-political\" test). See also: IRB. </p> <p>It is not correct that the availability of state protection is likely to be raised by the RPD. In Yuling's case, the state is the persecutory agent and therefore state protection is not available. </p> <p>It is not necessary to demonstrate that Yuling tried to obtain state protection since it would not have been reasonably forthcoming. Yuling and Mei's fear of persecution is by reason of membership in a particular social group (1 of 5 Convention grounds). </p> <p>A person who has claimed refugee protection may not be charged for possessing and using a fraudulent document to enter Canada (IRPA s 122, 133).</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>\u2665\ufe0f</p> <p>If Yuling and Mei proceed with a joint refugee claim, which of the following is true?</p> <ul> <li> A designated representative for Mei will be appointed because she is under 18.</li> <li> No designated representative for Mei will be appointed because she is over 16.</li> <li> Mei can choose to not attend the hearing since she is under 18.</li> <li> Mei must attend the hearing because she is over 12 years old. <p>Mei must attend the hearing because she is over 12 years old. The IRB stipulates that children over 12 years of age who are also claiming refugee protection must attend the hearing ( IRB). It is not correct that a designated representative will be appointed for Mei or that Mei can choose not to attend the hearing. In this case, Mei and Yuling's claims would automatically be joined (Refugee Protection Division Rules, 55(1)). </p> <p>Normally a designated representative would be necessary if claimant is under 18 (not under 16), but in this case no designated representative is needed because her claim is joined with her parent's (Refugee Protection Division Rules, 20(2)).</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>\u2665\ufe0f</p> <p>An RCIC may receive CPD credit for each of the following activities, except:</p> <ul> <li> Attending an online educational seminar on immigration law.</li> <li> Co-authoring a chapter in a book relating to the practice of citizenship law.</li> <li> Providing pro bono advice on immigration matters.</li> <li> Writing articles on immigration to Canada for a foreign-language publication. <p>See Continuing Professional Development Regulation ss 6 and 7. </p> <p>Attending an online educational seminar on immigration law and writing a book or article, with or without a co-author, where the content aligns to the Essential Competencies for RCICs are eligible CPD activities under Continuing Professional Development Regulation s 6. </p> <p>Providing pro bono advice on immigration matters is not an eligible CPD activity under the Continuing Professional Development Regulation s 7.</p> </li> </ul> <p></p> <p>\u2665\ufe0f</p> <p>Iakob is a 32-year-old Greek citizen who received his bachelor of computer science from the University of Waterloo in Ontario in 2014.

In this sample, you will find \"Transfer of Land\" and its \"affidavit of execution for witness\". Together with the documents of Affidavit Re Value signed by buyer, these three documents are good enough for land title transfer registration, if sellers are two or more owners of the land title.</li> <li> Consent of Spouse : If seller is the only owner of the land title and he/she is married, we usually need seller's spouse to sign this document. Furthermore, a lawyer needs to provide a certificate as an identification evidence.       One more issue you need to pay attention: \"Consent of Spouse\" should be on the same page as the Transfer of Land (you may have already noticed the redacted part on the document. I did so to draw you attention to the transfer content, but consent content should be there if in real practice). If you are going to use a separate page to have the spouse to sign the consent, lawyer needs to provide a confirmation letter to the Land Title Office, certifying the connection between the consent and the property.       In some very rare situations where the property is not resided by couples, spouse consent is not required by laws as to the disposition of the property. Seller can sign a Dower Affidavit instead. If seller is single/unmarried, then he/she can sign another version of Dower Affidavit.</li> </ul> <p>For the purpose of land title transfer registration, the above documents are good enough. Here below are other supporting documents either for record or required by buyer side.</p> <ul> <li> Certificate of Exempt Supply : In a resale transaction, buyer will need this document as proof that he/she does not need to pay GST.</li> <li> Statutory Declaration RPR : This is the seller's promise that the RPR of the property is clean and there's no encroachment to a third party interest.</li> <li> Notes to Seller : This in a document of to-do list for seller, reminding he/she of the work to do before closing.</li> <li> Direction to Pay : Seller to authorize lawyer pay mortgage payout, taxes, and legal fees and disbursements to relevant parties out of trust account, and the final balance to seller.</li> <li> Statutory Declaration re Canadian Residency : If Seller is non-resident, lawyer has an obligation to withhold a large amount of money in the trust account to clear taxes before settlement.
