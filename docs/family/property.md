## What is family property?

Family property, or marital assets, are property acquired during the marriage, specifically, after the date of marriage and before the date of separation. 

Any asset acquired during this period, regardless of which spouse acquired it, so long as it still exists at the date of separation, is considered family property.

For the purposes of dividing family property during divorce, there are two important dates: 

- the date of marriage; and 
- the valuation date (sometimes called the separation date). 

These dates represent the `beginning` and `end` date of the economic partnership. While the date of marriage is usually uncontentious, the date of separation can sometimes be a major point of disagreement as it plays a significant role in determining net family property values.

## When is the valuation date?

Section 4(1) of the [Family Law Act of Ontario](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90f03){:target="_blank"} defines the “valuation date”, meaning the earliest of the following dates:

1.	The date the spouses separate and there is no reasonable prospect that they will resume cohabitation.
2.	The date a divorce is granted.
3.	The date the marriage is declared a nullity.
4.	The date one of the spouses commences an application based on subsection 5 (3) (improvident depletion) that is subsequently granted.
5.	The date before the date on which one of the spouses dies leaving the other spouse surviving

## How are assets divided in a divorce in Ontario?

In Ontario, generally, marital assets are divided equally between the spouses. 

Married spouses are entitled to an equal share in the value of the marital assets, not the assets themselves. The equalization payment is `half the difference` between the spouses net family property.

## The Matrimonial Home

Section 18(1) of the [Family Law Act of Ontario](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90f03){:target="_blank"} defines a matrimonial home as:

> Every property in which a person has an interest and that is or, if the spouses have separated, was at the time of separation ordinarily occupied by the person and his or her spouse as their family residence is their matrimonial home.

As a result of this definition, vacation or recreational properties such as cottages and trailers may be a matrimonial home and a couple may have more than one matrimonial home at any given time.

**The matrimonial home is treated uniquely:**

It is excluded from the date of marriage asset calculation. This means that if Spouse A owned a home `on the date of marriage` and it became the matrimonial home, or proceeds from the sale of that property went to a matrimonial home, that asset is not included in the calculation. 

In another word, the matrimonial home is not regarded as prior marriage asset. Its value is carried forward to the marriage and should be divided equally between spouses.

## Each spouse is entitled to half the value of the family property

The value of property owned during the marriage that still exists at the date of separation is to be divided equally between the spouses. In addition, for those acquired before the marriage, but any increase in value of property during the marriage (from the date of marriage until the date of separation) is to be shared equally between the spouses.

When the marriage ends, each spouse is entitled to half the value of the property acquired during the marriage. It is important to note the entitlement is to half the value of the property, not to half the property itself.

## Division of family property and equalization Payment

Each spouse prepares a `Net Family Property Statement` and the spouse with the higher value of net family property pays the other spouse half the difference, this payment is called the Equalization Payment.

**Net Family Property Calculation:**

Each spouse’s net family property (NFP) is calculated as follows:

- Total value of assets at the date of separation: `AS`
- Total debts/liabilities at the date of separation: `LS`
- Total value of assets at the date of marriage: `AM`
- Total debts/liabilities at the date of marriage: `LM`

Calculate the separation date total:

`Separation Net` =  `AS` - `LS`

Calculate the marriage date total:

`Marriage Net` = `AM` - `LM`

Calculate the final Net Family Property: 

`Final NFP` = `Separation Net` - `Marriage Net`

> Note: the Net Family Property value can never be a negative number, if at the end of your calculations you have an NFP that is in the negative digits, it’s treated as though it were zero.

The equalization payment is determined by deducting the lower of the two NFP’s from the higher, and the spouse with the higher NFP pays `half the difference` to the other spouse.

Sometimes, an unequal division of property may be ordered by the court when an equal division would be unfair. Examples: 

- if a spouse intentionally depletes net family property
- a spouse fails debts or liabilities existing at the date of marriage
- the period of cohabitation was less than five years
- if one spouse incurs a disproportionate share of debts or liabilities

## What property is excluded from NFP calculation

Section 4(2) of the [Family Law Act of Ontario](https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/90f03){:target="_blank"} provides that certain property owned on the separation/valuation date may be excluded from net family property calculations:

- Property, other than a matrimonial home, that was acquired by gift or inheritance from a third person after the date of the marriage.
- Income from property referred to in paragraph 1, if the donor or testator has expressly stated that it is to be excluded from the spouse’s net family property.
- Damages or a right to damages for personal injuries, nervous shock, mental distress or loss of guidance, care and companionship, or the part of a settlement that represents those damages.
- Proceeds or a right to proceeds of a policy of life insurance, as defined under the Insurance Act, that are payable on the death of the life insured.
- Property, other than a matrimonial home, into which property referred to in paragraphs 1 to 4 can be traced.
- Property that the spouses have agreed by a domestic contract, marriage contract or prenup is not to be included in the spouse’s net family property.
- Unadjusted pensionable earnings under the Canada Pension Plan.

**Important Notes About Exclusions:**
> - If a property was gifted to or inherited by a spouse and it became the matrimonial home or the proceeds of the property went to the matrimonial home, it cannot be excluded.
  - To maintain an exclusion, never mix inheritance funds with other funds and keep them in a separate bank account. Keep all receipts and transaction records so you can trace the property back to the original exclusion.
  - The spouse claiming the exclusion bears the onus of proving the claim.
