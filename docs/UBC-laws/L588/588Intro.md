## Welcome

Throughout the course, we will refer to B.C. legislation and the  B.C. Law Society’s Code of Professional Conduct for British Columbia and within that context discuss the ethical issues facing lawyers. 

## Course Reading Materials

Excerpts from two textbooks used for this course:

- Alice Woolley et al, eds, *Lawyers’ Ethics and Professional Regulation* (Toronto: LexisNexis Canada) (“Woolley”) 
- Randal Graham, *Legal Ethics: Theories, Cases, and Professional Regulation*, 3rd Edition (Toronto: Emond, 2014) (“Graham”) 

In addition the following online materials are used:

- The *Legal Profession Act*, SBC 1998, c 9 [“***Act***”] can be accessed at: [https://www.bclaws.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/98009_01](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/98009_01){:target=" \_blank"}.

For listed Code rules you are also responsible for all of the commentaries to the rule,  but not the “annotations” in the online version.
