#### <p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">**Module Content**</p>

## 1.1 Introduction to the Course

This course was originally developed by the Course Author, Professor **Benjamin Perrin**, and is being delivered to you by your Course Instructor.

There are seven units in this course, and within each unit there are a number of topics. Within these topics, you will read summaries of the law, legislation (especially excerpts from the *Criminal Code*), judicial decisions (also called cases or case law), and other materials. You will also view videos on course topics and mini-lectures by the Course Author.

At the end of each unit, you will be able to demonstrate what you have learned and see how you are doing in terms of knowledge of the law through a short quiz. These quizzes are not marked, but their completion will count towards your participation mark.

Each unit also has a Discussion Forum where you will participate in the Discussion Activities that appear in certain topics (like we will do in a moment below). You will also be able to submit your answer to a Practice Problem to the Course Instructor for feedback at the end of Unit 3. this is critical to helping you develop and improve your skills in legal analysis and writing.

## 1.2 Sources of Law

**Major Sources of Criminal Law**

!!! note "Reading"

    - Read **pages 7-11** of the **Casebook**: "The Constitutional Context of the Criminal Law." Read this excerpt from the casebook on “The Criminal Law and the Constitution” to see whether you were able to identify the major constitutional provisions related to criminal law.

The three major sources of criminal law are:

- **Constitutional Law:** comprised of the *Constitution Act*, 1867 and *Constitution Act*, 1982 (including the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*)
- **Statutory Law:** also referred to as legislation, which is enacted by the federal Parliament (e.g. *Criminal Code*) or provincial legislatures, acting within their respective areas of jurisdiction
- **Common Law:** judicial decisions by various levels of courts, which is also referred to as “judge-made law”, “case law” or jurisprudence

**Constitutional Law**

Canadian Constitutional Law is comprised of written constitution instruments (the *Constitution Act*, 1867 and *Constitution Act*, 1982) and an unwritten constitution (including principles and constitutional conventions).
