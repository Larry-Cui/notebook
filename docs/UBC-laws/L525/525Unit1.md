# Introduction to the Criminal Law

<!-- #### <p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">**Module Content**</p> -->

## 1.1 Introduction to the Course

This course was originally developed by the Course Author, Professor **Benjamin Perrin**, and is being delivered to you by your Course Instructor.

There are seven units in this course, and within each unit there are a number of topics. Within these topics, you will read summaries of the law, legislation (especially excerpts from the *Criminal Code*), judicial decisions (also called cases or case law), and other materials. You will also view videos on course topics and mini-lectures by the Course Author.

At the end of each unit, you will be able to demonstrate what you have learned and see how you are doing in terms of knowledge of the law through a short quiz. These quizzes are not marked, but their completion will count towards your participation mark.

Each unit also has a Discussion Forum where you will participate in the Discussion Activities that appear in certain topics (like we will do in a moment below). You will also be able to submit your answer to a Practice Problem to the Course Instructor for feedback at the end of Unit 3. this is critical to helping you develop and improve your skills in legal analysis and writing.

## 1.2 Sources of Law

**Major Sources of Criminal Law**

!!! note "Reading"

    - Read **pages 7-11** of the **Casebook**: "The Constitutional Context of the Criminal Law." Read this excerpt from the casebook on “The Criminal Law and the Constitution” to see whether you were able to identify the major constitutional provisions related to criminal law.

The three major sources of criminal law are:

- **Constitutional Law:** comprised of the *Constitution Act*, 1867 and *Constitution Act*, 1982 (including the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*)
- **Statutory Law:** also referred to as legislation, which is enacted by the federal Parliament (e.g. *Criminal Code*) or provincial legislatures, acting within their respective areas of jurisdiction
- **Common Law:** judicial decisions by various levels of courts, which is also referred to as “judge-made law”, “case law” or jurisprudence

**Constitutional Law**

Canadian Constitutional Law is comprised of written constitution instruments (the *Constitution Act*, 1867 and *Constitution Act*, 1982) and an unwritten constitution (including principles and constitutional conventions).

**THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT OF CRIMINAL LAW**

The supreme source of criminal law in Canada is the Constitution, as represented by both the division of powers between federal and provincial governments in ss 91 and 92 of the *Constitution Act*, 1867 and the rights and freedoms in the 1982 *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*.

**A. THE CRIMINAL LAW AND THE DIVISION OF POWERS**

**Section 91(27)** of the *Constitution Act*, 1867 vests in the **federal** Parliament exclusive jurisdiction to legislate in relation to 

> the Criminal Law, except the Constitution of Courts of Criminal Jurisdiction, but including the Procedure in Criminal Matters.

This means that the **substance** of criminal law and **rules of criminal procedure** in Canada are federal matters. 

The **federal** Parliament also has jurisdiction under **s 91(28)** to establish, maintain, and manage **penitentiaries**, which have been considered to be the place of detention for persons serving terms of imprisonment lasting **two years or more**. 

The **provinces** have jurisdiction under **s 92(15)** to impose punishment by way of fine, penalty, or imprisonment in order to enforce valid provincial laws. The provinces also have jurisdiction over the administration of justice under **s 92(14)**, the establishment of “Reformatory Prisons” (**s 92(6)**) (the place of detention for persons serving terms of imprisonment lasting **less than two years**), and “Asylums” (**s 92(7)**), and property and civil rights (**s 92(13)**). 

The federal government appoints the judges of the **higher superior trial courts** under **s 96** of the *Constitution Act*, 1867. The provinces appoint judges to **provincial courts**, **where most criminal trials are held**.

!!! info "Martin L Friedland, “*Criminal Justice and the Division of Power in Canada*”"

    - Provincial laws can be struck down either for lack of constitutional power under section 92 or for conflict with federal legislation. Under both heads the Supreme Court of Canada has tended to uphold provincial law.
    - As you will read below, a provincial attempt to prohibit the performance of an abortion other than in a hospital has been held to be an invalid provincial attempt to enact criminal laws. See ***R. v. Morgentaler***, [1993 CanLII 74 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fs14){:target=" \_blank"}.

--- 

**Statutory Law**

Based on the federal Parliament’s exclusive jurisdiction over criminal law and procedure (**s. 91(27)**, *Constitution Act*, 1867), it has enacted numerous pieces of legislation related to criminal law. The three most important are the:

- [***Criminal Code***](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46){:target=" \_blank"}, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46: Canada’s primary criminal law statute. 
- [***Controlled Drugs and Substances Act***](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-38.8){:target=" \_blank"}, S.C. 1996, c. 19: Canada’s specialized statute dealing with illicit drugs.
- [***Youth Criminal Justice Act***](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/Y-1.5){:target=" \_blank"}, S.C. 2002, c. 1: Canada’s criminal law statute governing persons who allegedly committed an offence(s) while under the age of eighteen years.

In Canada’s “**constitutional democracy**”, any law or governmental action can be challenged as being contrary to the constitution. If the law or governmental action is found to violate the constitution, then a court may grant a remedy (e.g. declaring the law is “of no force and effect” or striking it down).

Where a piece of legislation is constitutionally valid (i.e. it complies with the constitutional division of powers and the Charter), then the courts will enforce it, and it will supersede any earlier judicial decisions on the same matter. However, even constitutionally valid laws must be applied and enforced in a way that complies with the *Charter*.

#### <p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">Textbook Summary: pages 23-24</p>

!!! info "Alan W Mewett, “*The Criminal Law, 1867-1967*”"

    - One significant change was that enacted by **section 8 [now s 9]** stating:
    
    > Notwithstanding anything in this Act or any other Act, no person shall be convicted or discharged under section 736
    >
    > (a) of an offence at common law, 
    >
    > (b) of an offence under an Act of the Parliament of England, or of Great Britain, or of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, or 
    >
    > (c) of an offence under an Act or ordinance in force in any province, territory or place before that province, territory or place became a province of Canada, but nothing in this section affects the power, jurisdiction or authority that a court, judge, justice or provincial court judge had, immediately before April 1, 1955, to impose punishment for contempt of court.

    - It was thus not until 1953 that all common law offences were abolished through-out Canada. ... the Revision Commissioners decided that there was no point in preserving them after 1953. Instead, all those thought applicable to Canada were specifically enacted.

    - On the other hand,, ... **section 7(2) [now s 8(3)]** providing:

    > Every rule and principle of the common law that renders any circumstance a justification or excuse for an act or a defence to a charge continues in force and applies in respect of proceedings for an offence under this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, except insofar as they are altered by or are inconsistent with this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada.

---

**Common Law**

Depending on the case at issue, judicial decisions can have one or more of the following features:

- A judicial decision may **interpret a statutory provision** (e.g. a term in a *Criminal Code* offence) and apply that interpretation to the facts of the case.
- A judicial decision may **interpret a constitutional provision** (e.g. the meaning of a legal right in the *Charter*) and apply that interpretation to: 
    - (a) a statutory provision (e.g. an offence or penalty provision in the Criminal Code); 
    - (b) a previous judicial decision to bring it into conformity with the constitution; or 
    - (c) the facts of the case (e.g. assessing whether the conduct of the police in the case met the necessary constitutional standards).
- A judicial decision may also be an **independent source of law**, particularly when there is no legislation addressing the specific issue.

### Discussion: Federal Gov't Options

What options does the federal government have if it disagrees with a judicial decision interpreting the Criminal Code? Are there any limitations to those options? 

**Answer:**

If the federal government disagrees with a judicial decision interpreting the Criminal Code, it has several institutional options, though all are constrained by constitutional principles and the rule of law.

First, the government may appeal the decision to a higher court, provided there is a right of appeal or leave is granted. This is the most direct response and allows appellate courts, including ultimately the Supreme Court of Canada, to clarify or correct the interpretation of the law. Through the appeal process, the government can argue that the lower court erred in its statutory interpretation, legal reasoning, or application of precedent.

Second, if the judicial interpretation is final or remains unsatisfactory after appeals are exhausted, the government may pursue a legislative response by introducing a bill to amend the Criminal Code. Parliament has the authority to clarify, modify, or overturn the practical effect of a judicial interpretation through legislation, so long as it acts within its constitutional competence. This option reflects parliamentary supremacy in law-making, as opposed to judicial supremacy in interpretation.

However, the legislative route is neither simple nor guaranteed. Any proposed amendment must pass through the full legislative process, including readings, committee review, and approval by both the House of Commons and the Senate. Political opposition, public scrutiny, and competing policy priorities may prevent the bill from passing or significantly alter its content.

Moreover, legislative amendments remain subject to constitutional limits. If the new law is inconsistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms or other constitutional provisions, it may be challenged and ultimately declared invalid by the courts, including the Supreme Court of Canada. As a result, while Parliament can respond to judicial decisions, it cannot do so in a way that overrides constitutional supremacy.


## 1.3 Criminal Offences and Defences

**Criminal Law Offences**

A criminal offence is comprised of two key elements: the ***actus reus*** or prohibited conduct, and the ***mens rea*** or mental fault. 

> 265 (1) A person commits an assault when

> (a) without the consent of another person, he applies force intentionally to that other person, directly or indirectly;

The offence of assault in section 265(1)(a) of the *Criminal Code* is comprised of the *actus reus* of applying force to another person, directly or indirectly, and the *mens rea* of intentionally doing so knowing that the other person is not consenting to that application of force.


#### <p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">Textbook Summary: pages 25-26</p>

The central idea of a criminal code is to consolidate the criminal law into a single, coherent, and therefore readily knowable source. ... **no one should be punishable for an offence found only in the common law**. 

The approach to exhaustivity in the Criminal Code in respect of common law offences and defences differs.

Yet even before the **abolition of common law offences** by the 1953 *Criminal Code*, the Supreme Court of Canada in ***Frey v Fedoruk*** (a civil action for false imprisonment and malicious prosecution) had decided not to increase the number of common law offences and thus refused to declare it to be an offence to be a “peeping tom.”

!!! info "*Frey v. Fedoruk et al.*, [1950 CanLII 24 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/21v52){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - This appeal raises questions as to whether the conduct of the Plaintiff, which is popularly described as that of a “peeping tom,” constitutes a criminal offence and if so, whether the Defendants **Fedoruk** and **Stone** were justified in arresting the Plaintiff without a warrant. 
    - If it should be admitted as a principle that conduct may be treated as criminal because, although not otherwise criminal, it has a natural tendency to provoke violence by way of retribution, it seems to me that great **uncertainty** would result.
    - ... it would introduce great uncertainty into the administration of the Criminal Law, leaving it to the judicial officer trying any particular charge to decide that the acts proved constituted a crime or otherwise, not by reference to any defined standard to be found in the code or in reported decisions, but according to his individual view as to whether such acts were a disturbance of the tranquility of people tending to provoke physical reprisal.

---

**Criminal Law Defences**

In criminal law, “defences” is a broad label used to describe excuses or justifications that operate to prevent an accused person from being found guilty of the offence charged.

At this stage, we are interested in which sources of law create criminal law defences: are defences limited to statutory law, as was the case above with offences? If not, why is a distinction made? These questions are addressed in the next case.

Supreme Court of Canada found that criminal law defences may appear in **statute**, but may also continue to be recognized at **common law** by the courts.

#### <p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">Textbook Summary: pages 35-37</p>

!!! info "*Amato v. The Queen*, [1982 CanLII 31 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1lpcs){:target=" \_blank"}"
 
    - If a defence arises in the common law it can only find its way into the courts through s. 8(3) of the *Code*:
        
        > 8(3) Every rule and principle of the common law that renders any circumstance a justification or excuse for an act or a defence to a charge continues in force and applies in respect of proceedings for an offence under this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, except in so far as they are altered by or are inconsistent with this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada.
    - The common law would be allowed to develop defences not inconsistent with the provisions of the *Code* if the construction adopted was prospective. 
    - Applying the ordinary rule of construction where statutes and common law meet I conclude that s. 8(3) is the authority for the courts of criminal jurisdiction to adopt, if appropriate in the view of the court, defences including the defence of entrapment.

In 1987, the Law Reform Commission of Canada proposed that all defences be set out in a new Criminal Code “in the interest of comprehensiveness.” The commission noted that it would still be “open to the courts to develop other defences insofar as is required by the reference to ‘principles of fundamental justice’ in section 7 of the *Charter*.”

As you will read later in this book, a number of the principal defences in Canadian criminal law, including **intoxication**, **automatism**, **necessity**, and **duress**, are entirely common law defences or are only partially addressed in the Criminal Code.

---

Section 8(3) of the *Criminal Code* (“**Common law principles continued**”), was the provision interpreted in ***Amato*** as confirming the ongoing ability of the courts to recognize new defences at common law.

In some instances, the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*, specifically section 7 (principles of fundamental justice) has been interpreted to require that certain defences be available to accused persons. Consistent with the previous unit on “Sources of Law”, because constitutional law (e.g. the *Charter*) is the supreme law of Canada, it supersedes statutory law. This means that if a statutory provision limited or denied a defence that must be made available under the *Charter*, then the courts would recognize such a defence. We will explore this “constitutionalization” of defences in Unit 6 further and the issue is merely flagged here.

## 1.4 Interpreting the Criminal Code

The historical approach that judges adopted at common law to interpreting the Criminal Code is called the **doctrine of strict construction**. Under this approach, any ambiguity in the meaning of a criminal law provision is interpreted in favour of the Accused. However, in more recent times, the doctrine of strict construction has been effectively **abandoned** by the Supreme Court of Canada **in favour of the “modern approach”** to statutory interpretation.

The modern approach (also called the **purposive and contextual approach**) to statutory interpretation is how the *Criminal Code* is interpreted today. 

#### <p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">Textbook Summary: pages 37, 42-45, 46</p>

In ***Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex***, [2002 SCC 42](https://canlii.ca/t/51s6){:target=" \_blank"}, the Court set out the basic rule governing the interpretation of statutes: 

> [26] In Elmer Driedger’s definitive formulation, found at p. 87 of his *Construction of Statutes* (2nd ed. 1983):

>> Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense **harmoniously with the scheme** of the Act, the **object** of the Act, and the **intention** of Parliament.

Driedger’s modern approach has been repeatedly cited by this Court as the preferred approach to statutory interpretation across a wide range of interpretive settings ... . I note as well that, in the federal legislative context, this Court’s preferred approach is buttressed by s. 12 of the *Interpretation Act*, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, which provides that **every enactment “is deemed remedial, and shall be given such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as best ensures the attainment of its objects**.”

That being so, how does one resolve apparent differences in the meaning of the French and English versions of a provision? The Court addressed this in ***Schreiber v. Canada (Attorney General)***, [2002 SCC 62](https://canlii.ca/t/51rl){:target=" \_blank"}. Justice LeBel explained the rule as follows:

> [56] A principle of **bilingual statutory interpretation** holds that where one version is ambiguous and the other is clear and unequivocal, **the common meaning of the two versions would a priori be preferred**; see: ***Côté***, *supra*, at p. 327; and ***Tupper v. The Queen***, 1967 CanLII 14 (SCC), [1967] S.C.R. 589. Furthermore, where one of the two versions is broader than the other, **the common meaning would favour the more restricted or limited meaning** ... .

***R. v. Clark***, [2005 SCC 2](https://canlii.ca/t/1jmfj){:target=" \_blank"} concerned the application of the normal common law rules of statutory interpretation to determine the meaning of an aspect of the prohibited act, or *actus reus*, whether the activity in question occurred in a “public place.” As you will learn in Chapter 6, significant interpretive problems also arise in respect of defining the fault element, or *mens rea*, of criminal offences.

In addition to the normal rules or “canons” of statutory interpretation, there is a special principle that applies specifically to legislation that might affect an individual’s liberty: **the rule of strict construction of penal statutes**. This rule holds that when interpreting a penal statute, including the *Criminal Code*, any **real textual ambiguities should be resolved in a way that benefits the accused**. 

But when should courts apply the rule of strict construction? The following case explores the rule of strict construction and answers this important question.

!!! info "*R. v. Paré*, [1987 CanLII 1 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1ftl2){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - Counsel for the respondent argue that the doctrine of strict construction of criminal statutes requires that this court adopt the **interpretation most favourable to the accused**. According to this argument the words “while committing” must be narrowly construed so as to elevate murder to first degree only when the death and the underlying offence occur simultaneously. In order to assess the validity of this position we must examine the **doctrine of strict construction**. 
    - Thus, while the original justification for the doctrine has been substantially eroded, the seriousness of imposing criminal penalties of any sort demands that **reasonable doubts be resolved in favour of the accused**. 
    - it is clearly grammatically possible to construe the words “while committing” in s. 214(5) as requiring murder to be classified as first degree only if it is exactly coincidental with the underlying offence. ... **We still have to determine whether the narrow interpretation of “while committing” is a reasonable one, given the scheme and purpose of the legislation**.
    - In my view, such an interpretation has been provided by Martin J.A. in ***Stevens*** [(1984), 11 CCC (3d) 518 (Ont CA)]. As noted above, Martin J.A. suggested that “where the act causing death and the acts constituting the rape, attempted rape, indecent assault or an attempt to commit indecent assault, as the case may be, all form part of one continuous sequence of events forming a single transaction” the death was caused “while committing” an offence for the purposes of s. 214(5).
    - The murder represents an exploitation of the position of power created by the underlying crime and makes the entire course of conduct a “single transaction.” This approach, in my view, best gives effect to the philosophy underlying s. 214(5). 

In a number of subsequent cases, the Supreme Court has affirmed that courts should only resort to the principle of the strict construction of the criminal law, and other “special” rules of statutory construction, **if there remains an ambiguity after the law has been subject to a contextual and purposive interpretation**. 

As the Court explained in ***Bell ExpressVu***, one must first apply this normal, “modern approach” to statutory interpretation to determine whether an ambiguity truly exists. “Other principles of interpretation, such as the strict construction of penal statutes and the ‘*Charter* values’ presumption, only receive application where there is ambiguity as to the meaning of a provision” (at para 28).

!!! info "*Bell ExpressVu*"

    **Principles of Statutory Interpretation**
    
    - 26 In Elmer Driedger’s definitive formulation, found at p. 87 of his *Construction of Statutes* (2nd ed. 1983):
 
    > Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.

    Driedger’s modern approach has been repeatedly cited by this Court as the preferred approach to statutory interpretation across a wide range of interpretive settings...  I note as well that, in the federal legislative context, this Court’s preferred approach is buttressed by s. 12 of the *Interpretation Act*, R.S.C. 1985, c. I-21, which provides that every enactment “is deemed remedial, and shall be given such fair, large and liberal construction and interpretation as best ensures the attainment of its objects”.

    - 27 The preferred approach recognizes the important role that **context** must inevitably play when a court construes the written words of a statute: as Professor **John Willis** incisively noted in his seminal article “*Statute Interpretation in a Nutshell*” (1938), 16 Can. Bar Rev. 1, at p. 6, “words, like people, take their colour from their surroundings”.  This being the case, where the provision under consideration is found in an Act that is itself a component of a larger statutory scheme, the surroundings that colour the words and the scheme of the Act are more expansive.  In such an instance, the application of Driedger’s principle gives rise to what was described in ***R. v. Ulybel Enterprises Ltd.***, [2001] 2 S.C.R. 867, 2001 SCC 56, at para. 52, as “**the principle of interpretation that presumes a harmony, coherence, and consistency between statutes dealing with the same subject matter**”.
    - 28 Other principles of interpretation, such as the **strict construction of penal statutes** and the **“*Charter* values” presumption**, **only receive application where there is ambiguity as to the meaning of a provision**.
    - 29 What, then, in law is an ambiguity? To answer, an ambiguity must be “real”. The words of the provision must be “reasonably capable of more than one meaning”.  By necessity, however, one must consider the “entire context” of a provision before one can determine if it is reasonably capable of multiple interpretations.  In this regard, Major J.’s statement in ***CanadianOxy Chemicals Ltd. v. Canada (Attorney General)***, 1999 CanLII 680 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 743, at para. 14, is apposite:  “It is only when genuine ambiguity arises between two or more plausible readings, each equally in accordance with the intentions of the statute, that the courts need to resort to external interpretive aids” (emphasis added), to which I would add, “including other principles of interpretation”.
    - 30 For this reason, ambiguity cannot reside in the mere fact that several courts, or, for that matter, several doctrinal writers, have come to differing conclusions on the interpretation of a given provision.  Just as it would be improper for one to engage in a preliminary tallying of the number of decisions supporting competing interpretations and then apply that which receives the “higher score”, it is not appropriate to take as one’s starting point the premise that differing interpretations reveal an ambiguity.  It is necessary, in every case, for the court charged with interpreting a provision to undertake the **contextual and purposive approach** set out by Driedger, and **thereafter to determine if “the words are ambiguous enough to induce** two people to spend good money in backing two **opposing views** as to their meaning”.

The current approach used to interpret the *Criminal Code* is described in these readings, namely the “modern approach” (also called the **purposive or contextual approach**) on page 48 of the casebook from ***Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex***, [2002 SCC 42](https://canlii.ca/t/51s6){:target=" \_blank"}:

> ...the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the scheme of the Act, the object of the Act, and the intention of Parliament.

Later in the ***Bell ExpressVu*** decision, at paragraphs 28-30, there is an important discussion of the **residual role** that is still played by the doctrine of strict construction in interpreting the *Criminal Code*. Specifically, if the modern approach to statutory interpretation is applied and there is still ambiguity, then the court can apply the doctrine of strict construction to resolve the lingering ambiguity.
