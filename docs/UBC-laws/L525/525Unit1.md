# Introduction to the Criminal Law

#### <p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">**Module Content**</p>

## 1.1 Introduction to the Course

This course was originally developed by the Course Author, Professor **Benjamin Perrin**, and is being delivered to you by your Course Instructor.

There are seven units in this course, and within each unit there are a number of topics. Within these topics, you will read summaries of the law, legislation (especially excerpts from the *Criminal Code*), judicial decisions (also called cases or case law), and other materials. You will also view videos on course topics and mini-lectures by the Course Author.

At the end of each unit, you will be able to demonstrate what you have learned and see how you are doing in terms of knowledge of the law through a short quiz. These quizzes are not marked, but their completion will count towards your participation mark.

Each unit also has a Discussion Forum where you will participate in the Discussion Activities that appear in certain topics (like we will do in a moment below). You will also be able to submit your answer to a Practice Problem to the Course Instructor for feedback at the end of Unit 3. this is critical to helping you develop and improve your skills in legal analysis and writing.

## 1.2 Sources of Law

**Major Sources of Criminal Law**

!!! note "Reading"

    - Read **pages 7-11** of the **Casebook**: "The Constitutional Context of the Criminal Law." Read this excerpt from the casebook on “The Criminal Law and the Constitution” to see whether you were able to identify the major constitutional provisions related to criminal law.

The three major sources of criminal law are:

- **Constitutional Law:** comprised of the *Constitution Act*, 1867 and *Constitution Act*, 1982 (including the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*)
- **Statutory Law:** also referred to as legislation, which is enacted by the federal Parliament (e.g. *Criminal Code*) or provincial legislatures, acting within their respective areas of jurisdiction
- **Common Law:** judicial decisions by various levels of courts, which is also referred to as “judge-made law”, “case law” or jurisprudence

**Constitutional Law**

Canadian Constitutional Law is comprised of written constitution instruments (the *Constitution Act*, 1867 and *Constitution Act*, 1982) and an unwritten constitution (including principles and constitutional conventions).

**THE CONSTITUTIONAL CONTEXT OF CRIMINAL LAW**

The supreme source of criminal law in Canada is the Constitution, as represented by both the division of powers between federal and provincial governments in ss 91 and 92 of the *Constitution Act*, 1867 and the rights and freedoms in the 1982 *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*.

**A. THE CRIMINAL LAW AND THE DIVISION OF POWERS**

**Section 91(27)** of the *Constitution Act*, 1867 vests in the **federal** Parliament exclusive jurisdiction to legislate in relation to 

> the Criminal Law, except the Constitution of Courts of Criminal Jurisdiction, but including the Procedure in Criminal Matters.

This means that the **substance** of criminal law and **rules of criminal procedure** in Canada are federal matters. 

The **federal** Parliament also has jurisdiction under **s 91(28)** to establish, maintain, and manage **penitentiaries**, which have been considered to be the place of detention for persons serving terms of imprisonment lasting **two years or more**. 

The **provinces** have jurisdiction under **s 92(15)** to impose punishment by way of fine, penalty, or imprisonment in order to enforce valid provincial laws. The provinces also have jurisdiction over the administration of justice under **s 92(14)**, the establishment of “Reformatory Prisons” (**s 92(6)**) (the place of detention for persons serving terms of imprisonment lasting **less than two years**), and “Asylums” (**s 92(7)**), and property and civil rights (**s 92(13)**). 

The federal government appoints the judges of the **higher superior trial courts** under **s 96** of the *Constitution Act*, 1867. The provinces appoint judges to **provincial courts**, **where most criminal trials are held**.

!!! info "Martin L Friedland, “*Criminal Justice and the Division of Power in Canada*”"

    - Provincial laws can be struck down either for lack of constitutional power under section 92 or for conflict with federal legislation. Under both heads the Supreme Court of Canada has tended to uphold provincial law.
    - As you will read below, a provincial attempt to prohibit the performance of an abortion other than in a hospital has been held to be an invalid provincial attempt to enact criminal laws. See ***R. v. Morgentaler***, [1993 CanLII 74 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fs14){:target=" \_blank"}.
 

**Statutory Law**

Based on the federal Parliament’s exclusive jurisdiction over criminal law and procedure (**s. 91(27)**, *Constitution Act*, 1867), it has enacted numerous pieces of legislation related to criminal law. The three most important are the:

- [***Criminal Code***](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46){:target=" \_blank"}, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46: Canada’s primary criminal law statute. 
- [***Controlled Drugs and Substances Act***](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-38.8){:target=" \_blank"}, S.C. 1996, c. 19: Canada’s specialized statute dealing with illicit drugs.
- [***Youth Criminal Justice Act***](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/Y-1.5){:target=" \_blank"}, S.C. 2002, c. 1: Canada’s criminal law statute governing persons who allegedly committed an offence(s) while under the age of eighteen years.

In Canada’s “**constitutional democracy**”, any law or governmental action can be challenged as being contrary to the constitution. If the law or governmental action is found to violate the constitution, then a court may grant a remedy (e.g. declaring the law is “of no force and effect” or striking it down).

Where a piece of legislation is constitutionally valid (i.e. it complies with the constitutional division of powers and the Charter), then the courts will enforce it, and it will supersede any earlier judicial decisions on the same matter. However, even constitutionally valid laws must be applied and enforced in a way that complies with the *Charter*.

#### <p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">Textbook Summary: pages 23-24</p>

!!! info "Alan W Mewett, “*The Criminal Law, 1867-1967*”"

    - One significant change was that enacted by **section 8 [now s 9]** stating:
    
    > Notwithstanding anything in this Act or any other Act, no person shall be convicted or discharged under section 736
    >
    > (a) of an offence at common law, 
    >
    > (b) of an offence under an Act of the Parliament of England, or of Great Britain, or of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, or 
    >
    > (c) of an offence under an Act or ordinance in force in any province, territory or place before that province, territory or place became a province of Canada, but nothing in this section affects the power, jurisdiction or authority that a court, judge, justice or provincial court judge had, immediately before April 1, 1955, to impose punishment for contempt of court.

    - It was thus not until 1953 that all common law offences were abolished through-out Canada. ... the Revision Commissioners decided that there was no point in preserving them after 1953. Instead, all those thought applicable to Canada were specifically enacted.

    - On the other hand,, ... **section 7(2) [now s 8(3)]** providing:

    > Every rule and principle of the common law that renders any circumstance a justification or excuse for an act or a defence to a charge continues in force and applies in respect of proceedings for an offence under this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, except insofar as they are altered by or are inconsistent with this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada.


**Common Law**

Depending on the case at issue, judicial decisions can have one or more of the following features:

- A judicial decision may **interpret a statutory provision** (e.g. a term in a *Criminal Code* offence) and apply that interpretation to the facts of the case.
- A judicial decision may **interpret a constitutional provision** (e.g. the meaning of a legal right in the *Charter*) and apply that interpretation to: 
    - (a) a statutory provision (e.g. an offence or penalty provision in the Criminal Code); 
    - (b) a previous judicial decision to bring it into conformity with the constitution; or 
    - (c) the facts of the case (e.g. assessing whether the conduct of the police in the case met the necessary constitutional standards).
- A judicial decision may also be an **independent source of law**, particularly when there is no legislation addressing the specific issue.

### Discussion: Federal Gov't Options

What options does the federal government have if it disagrees with a judicial decision interpreting the Criminal Code? Are there any limitations to those options? 

**Answer:**

If the federal government disagrees with a judicial decision interpreting the Criminal Code, it has several institutional options, though all are constrained by constitutional principles and the rule of law.

First, the government may appeal the decision to a higher court, provided there is a right of appeal or leave is granted. This is the most direct response and allows appellate courts, including ultimately the Supreme Court of Canada, to clarify or correct the interpretation of the law. Through the appeal process, the government can argue that the lower court erred in its statutory interpretation, legal reasoning, or application of precedent.

Second, if the judicial interpretation is final or remains unsatisfactory after appeals are exhausted, the government may pursue a legislative response by introducing a bill to amend the Criminal Code. Parliament has the authority to clarify, modify, or overturn the practical effect of a judicial interpretation through legislation, so long as it acts within its constitutional competence. This option reflects parliamentary supremacy in law-making, as opposed to judicial supremacy in interpretation.

However, the legislative route is neither simple nor guaranteed. Any proposed amendment must pass through the full legislative process, including readings, committee review, and approval by both the House of Commons and the Senate. Political opposition, public scrutiny, and competing policy priorities may prevent the bill from passing or significantly alter its content.

Moreover, legislative amendments remain subject to constitutional limits. If the new law is inconsistent with the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms or other constitutional provisions, it may be challenged and ultimately declared invalid by the courts, including the Supreme Court of Canada. As a result, while Parliament can respond to judicial decisions, it cannot do so in a way that overrides constitutional supremacy.


## 1.3 Criminal Offences and Defences

**Criminal Law Offences**

A criminal offence is comprised of two key elements: the ***actus reus*** or prohibited conduct, and the ***mens rea*** or mental fault. 

> 265 (1) A person commits an assault when

> (a) without the consent of another person, he applies force intentionally to that other person, directly or indirectly;

The offence of assault in section 265(1)(a) of the *Criminal Code* is comprised of the *actus reus* of applying force to another person, directly or indirectly, and the *mens rea* of intentionally doing so knowing that the other person is not consenting to that application of force.


#### <p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">Textbook Summary: pages 25-26</p>

The central idea of a criminal code is to consolidate the criminal law into a single, coherent, and therefore readily knowable source. ... no one should be punishable for an offence found only in the common law. 

The approach to exhaustivity in the Criminal Code in respect of common law offences and defences differs.

Yet even before the **abolition of common law offences** by the 1953 *Criminal Code*, the Supreme Court of Canada in ***Frey v Fedoruk*** (a civil action for false imprisonment and malicious prosecution) had decided not to increase the number of common law offences and thus refused to declare it to be an offence to be a “peeping tom.”

!!! info "*Frey v. Fedoruk et al.*, [1950 CanLII 24 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/21v52){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - This appeal raises questions as to whether the conduct of the Plaintiff, which is popularly described as that of a “peeping tom,” constitutes a criminal offence and if so, whether the Defendants **Fedoruk** and **Stone** were justified in arresting the Plaintiff without a warrant. 
    - If it should be admitted as a principle that conduct may be treated as criminal because, although not otherwise criminal, it has a natural tendency to provoke violence by way of retribution, it seems to me that great **uncertainty** would result.
    - ... it would introduce great uncertainty into the administration of the Criminal Law, leaving it to the judicial officer trying any particular charge to decide that the acts proved constituted a crime or otherwise, not by reference to any defined standard to be found in the code or in reported decisions, but according to his individual view as to whether such acts were a disturbance of the tranquility of people tending to provoke physical reprisal.
