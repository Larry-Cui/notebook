#  Acts and Omissions

<!-- #### <p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">**Module Content**</p> -->

## 3.1 Introduction

At common law, and now under section 7 of the Charter, every criminal offence must include **prohibited conduct** (*actus reus*) accompanied by the **requisite mental state** (*mens rea*).

This unit focuses on the essential elements of the *actus reus*. The Crown must prove each element of the *actus reus* **beyond a reasonable doubt**.

**Chapter 5: CONDUCT OR *ACTUS REUS***

The principle of legality excludes **retroactive application** of the criminal law and, according to Canadian constitutional jurisprudence examined in Chapter 1, it excludes the enforcement of offences that are impermissibly vague or overly broad.

One of the foundational principles of criminal liability is found in the maxim *actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea*, which, translated, states that an act is not guilty unless there is also a guilty mind. The same might be said in reverse: there can be no criminal liability unless a guilty mind expresses itself in the performance of prohibited conduct. 

**Lord Mansfield** said as much in 1784:
> So long as an act rests in bare intention, it is not punishable by our laws” (***Rex v Scofield*** (1784), Caldecott’s Rep 397). 

The concept of *actus reus* refers to more than simply a prohibited action; *actus reus* comprises a bundle of components that, together, constitute the “guilty act.” Put most helpfully, the *actus reus* requires a 

- **Physical voluntariness** – that the Accused did the prohibited physical action on purpose (this is discussed more in the next topic)
- **Act or omission** – what the Accused physically did (or didn’t do in the case of an omission)
- Sometimes in **prescribed circumstances** – for instance, if someone is charged with “assaulting a police officer”, the prescribed circumstance is that the assaulted person must have been a police officer.
- Sometimes causing **certain consequences** – for example, if someone is charged with “assault causing bodily harm”, the required consequence of the prohibited act (the assault) is that the assaulted person was harmed.

Each of these components is equally critical to defining the *actus reus* for a given offence, and the starting point is that a finding of guilt requires that the Crown **prove each** beyond a reasonable doubt.

## 3.2 Voluntariness

**Defining Physical Voluntariness**

Physical voluntariness is an essential element of the *actus reus* of every criminal offence. Without physical voluntariness there is no crime.

> Voluntariness, as it relates to the *actus reus* of a crime, queries whether the actor had “control over the movement of her body”, or whether the wrongful act was the product of a “**conscious will**”.

**I. VOLUNTARINESS**

The first of the elements of the *actus reus* is the requirement for voluntary conduct. Voluntariness is a requirement for every offence, whether a true crime or a quasi-criminal/regulatory offence. The requirement for voluntariness is best thought of as a demand that the prohibited conduct be **a product of the will** of the accused. 

The essential characteristic of voluntariness is the **conscious control of action**. Consciousness alone, however, is not enough to establish voluntariness because a person might be conscious and yet still be incapable of controlling his or her conduct. In sum, **the voluntariness of a person’s conduct will be established if his or her conduct is the product of conscious choice.** 

The decision in ***R. v. Larsonneur (1934)***, 24 Cr. App. R. 74 (Court of Criminal Appeal, England) is a case that demonstrates what can occur if voluntariness is not an essential element of an offence.

!!! info "*R v Larsonneur (1934)*, 24 Cr App R 74"

    - **Facts**: Larsonneur had a French passport and was granted access to England. Her passport was marked to say that she had to leave the country by a certain date. She left England on that date for Ireland, but was deported from Ireland and was sent back to England in Irish custody. She was found in England, and this was after the date that her passport allowed her to be in the country. She was convicted under the *Aliens Restrictions Act* for being in the country as an alien to whom **leave to land** had been refused. She was convicted at second trial and appealed on conviction.
    - **Issue**: Does it matter that she did not re-enter England on her own accord, but was forced to do so?
    - **Decision**: Appeal Dismissed
    - ***Ratio decidendi***: Even if you are physically forced to commit the *actus reus* of an offence against your will, you have still committed it for legal purposes (**this is no longer the case**).
