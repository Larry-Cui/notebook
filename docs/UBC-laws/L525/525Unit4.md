#  Mental Fault (*Mens Rea*)

<!-- #### <p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">**Module Content**</p> -->

## 4.1 Introduction

As noted earlier, every criminal offence has both an *actus reus* (prohibited conduct) and *mens rea* (requisite mental state) component. This unit focuses on *mens rea* and the criminal law’s **objective** to only **punish morally blameworthy conduct**.

**Legislative Definitions of Fault**

The *Criminal Code* does not include a definition of the various types of mental fault, so this has fallen to the courts to interpret. Before we delve into that jurisprudence, it may be helpful to first consider some basic definitions of some of the **main types of mental fault** that have been proposed by various legal organizations.

**“True Criminal Offences” versus Regulatory Offences**

A true criminal offence involves conduct that is so abhorrent to basic values of human society that it must be prohibited completely (e.g. murder, sexual assault, fraud, robbery). Only the federal Parliament has jurisdiction to enact criminal offences (e.g offences in the *Criminal Code* and *Controlled Drugs and Substances Act*). **If the offence you are considering comes from one of these two statutes, you can be almost certain that you are dealing with a true criminal offence.**

On the other hand, regulatory offences involve conduct that is not inherently wrongful, but if it were unregulated it would present some danger to society. **Both the federal Parliament and provincial legislatures may enact regulatory offences within their respective areas of jurisdiction** (e.g. provincial health inspections of restaurants, federal air transport safety regulations).

It can be critically important how an offence is classified between criminal and regulatory. This is because each has **a starting presumption of the minimal level of *mens rea*** required.

**Chapter 6: FAULT OR MENS REA**

In Canada, there has long been a presumption of statutory interpretation that *mens rea* forms a part of all criminal offences. As Estey J explained in ***Gaunt and Watts v. The Queen***, [1953 CanLII 40 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/21v5s){:target=" \_blank"} at 511:

> It is a general rule that *mens rea* is an essential ingredient of criminal offences. ... While **an offence of which *mens rea* is not an essential ingredient may be created by legislation**, in view of the general rule a section creating an offence ought not to be so construed unless Parliament has, by express language or necessary implication, disclosed such an intention.

Just as long-standing as *mens rea* has been confusion regarding what it entails. As Stephen J observed in ***R v Tolson (1889)***, 23 QBD 168 (Ct for Cr Cases Reserved):

> It naturally suggests that, apart from all particular definitions of crimes, such a thing exists as a “*mens rea*,” or “**guilty mind**,” which is always expressly or by implication involved in every definition. **This is obviously not the case, for the mental elements of different crimes differ widely.** 

> In some cases it denotes mere inattention. For instance, in the case of manslaughter by negligence it may mean forgetting to notice a signal. **It appears confusing to call so many dissimilar states of mind by one name.** It seems contradictory indeed to describe a mere absence of mind as “*mens rea*,” or guilty mind. 

**I. LEGISLATIVE DEFINITIONS OF FAULT**

In Canada, there is no uniform definition of the fault requirements that apply to offences. For example, the *Criminal Code* does not include a comprehensive part (referred to by academics and law reformers as a “general part”) that provides definitions of commonly used fault-related terms, like “intention,” “knowledge,” “wilful,” “purpose,” or “criminal negligence.” The definitional enterprise is **left largely to the courts** to interpret terms on an offence-by-offence, term-by-term basis. 

## 4.2 Absolute & Strict Liability

We begin examining the various types of mental fault in detail by looking at the types of mental fault with the **lowest evidentiary thresholds** (e.g. those that are the easiest for the Crown to establish). These **absolute liability** and **strict liability** standards are **only applicable to regulatory offences**. Later, we will contrast these with the more onerous types of mental fault applicable to **criminal offences**.

**Absolute Liability**

Absolute liability involves **no mental fault** requirement whatsoever. The Accused is liable solely based on having committed the *actus reus* of the offence. A common example of an absolute liability offence is a parking infraction.

Regulatory offences were once presumed at common law to require no fault element (i.e. absolute liability). However, this presumption could be displaced with clear statutory language.

As some regulatory offences can involve the possibility of imprisonment, absolute liability means that someone could possibly be liable to imprisonment without any mental fault at all. This would mean that even an “accident” could give rise to the possibility of imprisonment. As we will see, such a possibility is **not allowed** under the *Charter*. However, **for those regulatory offences that do not involve the possibility of imprisonment, absolute liability offences do still exist.**

The pre-*Charter* decision in ***R. v. Pierce Fisheries Ltd.***, [1970 CanLII 178 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1xd31){:target=" \_blank"} demonstrates how absolute liability offences operate and some of the problems associated with them. It demonstrates how critical the classification is of an offence as being a “true criminal offence” (presumed at common law to have subjective mental fault) or a regulatory offence (once presumed at common law to have no fault element, i.e. absolute liability).

In the decision in ***R. v. Wholesale Travel Group Inc.***, [1991 CanLII 39 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fsjf){:target=" \_blank"}, Justice Cory of the Supreme Court of Canada articulates further on the distinction between true **criminal offences** versus **regulatory offences**, including their historical evolution, purposes and rationales, and the role of **moral blameworthiness** in them. 

**Constitutional Considerations**

In Reference ***Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act***, [1985 CanLII 81 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/dln){:target=" \_blank"}, the Supreme Court of Canada held that this provincial regulatory offence that involved absolute liability violated section 7 of the *Charter*. It was not saved by section 1 of the *Charter* because it exposed the Accused to the possibility of imprisonment without any mental fault. In short, **“absolute liability and imprisonment cannot be combined.”**

**Strict Liability**

A new default standard of mental fault for such regulatory offences: “strict liability”. While it is a **low standard**, it does **involve a degree of mental fault**.

Strict liability means that once the Crown prosecutor has proven the *actus reus* of the offence **beyond a reasonable doubt**, the burden then shifts to the Accused to prove on **a balance of probabilities** that they exercised “**due diligence**” (e.g. took the steps that a reasonable person in the circumstances would have done).

In ***R. v. Sault Ste. Marie***, [1978 CanLII 11 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1mkbt){:target=" \_blank"}, the Supreme Court of Canada recognized for the first time that “**strict liability**” should be presumed at common law to be the **default level of mental fault for regulatory offences**. It bridges the gap between no fault requirement (absolute liability) and “full *mens rea*” (for criminal offences).

In ***Lévis (City) v. Tétreault; Lévis (City) v. 2629-4470 Québec inc.***, [2006 SCC 12](https://canlii.ca/t/1n0zk){:target=" \_blank"}, the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed the decision in ***R. v. City of Sault Ste. Marie*** and indicated that while it is still possible to have absolute liability offences if there is “clear proof of legislative intent”, such offences are now quite rare.

**Full Mens Rea**

**Although regulatory offences are presumed to be strict liability, they are capable of requiring “full *mens rea*” as would a true criminal offence.** 

This occurs when the otherwise regulatory provision has **express language** requiring a higher level of mental fault. For example, the provision might require that the Accused commit the act “**knowingly**”, or with “**intent**” or “**purpose**”.
