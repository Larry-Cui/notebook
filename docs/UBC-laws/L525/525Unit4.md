#  Mental Fault (*Mens Rea*)

<!-- #### <p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">**Module Content**</p> -->

## 4.1 Introduction

As noted earlier, every criminal offence has both an *actus reus* (prohibited conduct) and *mens rea* (requisite mental state) component. This unit focuses on *mens rea* and the criminal law’s **objective** to only **punish morally blameworthy conduct**.

**Legislative Definitions of Fault**

The *Criminal Code* does not include a definition of the various types of mental fault, so this has fallen to the courts to interpret. Before we delve into that jurisprudence, it may be helpful to first consider some basic definitions of some of the **main types of mental fault** that have been proposed by various legal organizations.

**“True Criminal Offences” versus Regulatory Offences**

A true criminal offence involves conduct that is so abhorrent to basic values of human society that it must be prohibited completely (e.g. murder, sexual assault, fraud, robbery). Only the federal Parliament has jurisdiction to enact criminal offences (e.g offences in the *Criminal Code* and *Controlled Drugs and Substances Act*). **If the offence you are considering comes from one of these two statutes, you can be almost certain that you are dealing with a true criminal offence.**

On the other hand, regulatory offences involve conduct that is not inherently wrongful, but if it were unregulated it would present some danger to society. **Both the federal Parliament and provincial legislatures may enact regulatory offences within their respective areas of jurisdiction** (e.g. provincial health inspections of restaurants, federal air transport safety regulations).

It can be critically important how an offence is classified between criminal and regulatory. This is because each has **a starting presumption of the minimal level of *mens rea*** required.

**Chapter 6: FAULT OR MENS REA**

In Canada, there has long been a presumption of statutory interpretation that *mens rea* forms a part of all criminal offences. As Estey J explained in ***Gaunt and Watts v. The Queen***, [1953 CanLII 40 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/21v5s){:target=" \_blank"} at 511:

> It is a general rule that *mens rea* is an essential ingredient of criminal offences. ... While **an offence of which *mens rea* is not an essential ingredient may be created by legislation**, in view of the general rule a section creating an offence ought not to be so construed unless Parliament has, by express language or necessary implication, disclosed such an intention.

Just as long-standing as *mens rea* has been confusion regarding what it entails. As Stephen J observed in ***R v Tolson (1889)***, 23 QBD 168 (Ct for Cr Cases Reserved):

> It naturally suggests that, apart from all particular definitions of crimes, such a thing exists as a “*mens rea*,” or “**guilty mind**,” which is always expressly or by implication involved in every definition. **This is obviously not the case, for the mental elements of different crimes differ widely.** 

> In some cases it denotes mere inattention. For instance, in the case of manslaughter by negligence it may mean forgetting to notice a signal. **It appears confusing to call so many dissimilar states of mind by one name.** It seems contradictory indeed to describe a mere absence of mind as “*mens rea*,” or guilty mind. 

**I. LEGISLATIVE DEFINITIONS OF FAULT**

In Canada, there is no uniform definition of the fault requirements that apply to offences. For example, the *Criminal Code* does not include a comprehensive part (referred to by academics and law reformers as a “general part”) that provides definitions of commonly used fault-related terms, like “intention,” “knowledge,” “wilful,” “purpose,” or “criminal negligence.” The definitional enterprise is **left largely to the courts** to interpret terms on an offence-by-offence, term-by-term basis. 

## 4.2 Absolute & Strict Liability

We begin examining the various types of mental fault in detail by looking at the types of mental fault with the **lowest evidentiary thresholds** (e.g. those that are the easiest for the Crown to establish). These **absolute liability** and **strict liability** standards are **only applicable to regulatory offences**. Later, we will contrast these with the more onerous types of mental fault applicable to **criminal offences**.

**Absolute Liability**

Absolute liability involves **no mental fault** requirement whatsoever. The Accused is liable solely based on having committed the *actus reus* of the offence. A common example of an absolute liability offence is a parking infraction.

Regulatory offences were once presumed at common law to require no fault element (i.e. absolute liability). However, this presumption could be displaced with clear statutory language.

As some regulatory offences can involve the possibility of imprisonment, absolute liability means that someone could possibly be liable to imprisonment without any mental fault at all. This would mean that even an “accident” could give rise to the possibility of imprisonment. As we will see, such a possibility is **not allowed** under the *Charter*. However, **for those regulatory offences that do not involve the possibility of imprisonment, absolute liability offences do still exist.**

The pre-*Charter* decision in ***R. v. Pierce Fisheries Ltd.***, [1970 CanLII 178 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1xd31){:target=" \_blank"} demonstrates how absolute liability offences operate and some of the problems associated with them. It demonstrates how critical the classification is of an offence as being a “true criminal offence” (presumed at common law to have subjective mental fault) or a regulatory offence (once presumed at common law to have no fault element, i.e. absolute liability).

In the decision in ***R. v. Wholesale Travel Group Inc.***, [1991 CanLII 39 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fsjf){:target=" \_blank"}, Justice Cory of the Supreme Court of Canada articulates further on the distinction between true **criminal offences** versus **regulatory offences**, including their historical evolution, purposes and rationales, and the role of **moral blameworthiness** in them. 

**Constitutional Considerations**

In Reference ***Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act***, [1985 CanLII 81 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/dln){:target=" \_blank"}, the Supreme Court of Canada held that this provincial regulatory offence that involved absolute liability violated section 7 of the *Charter*. It was not saved by section 1 of the *Charter* because it exposed the Accused to the possibility of imprisonment without any mental fault. In short, **“absolute liability and imprisonment cannot be combined.”**

**Strict Liability**

A new default standard of mental fault for such regulatory offences: “strict liability”. While it is a **low standard**, it does **involve a degree of mental fault**.

Strict liability means that once the Crown prosecutor has proven the *actus reus* of the offence **beyond a reasonable doubt**, the burden then shifts to the Accused to prove on **a balance of probabilities** that they exercised “**due diligence**” (e.g. took the steps that a reasonable person in the circumstances would have done).

In ***R. v. Sault Ste. Marie***, [1978 CanLII 11 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1mkbt){:target=" \_blank"}, the Supreme Court of Canada recognized for the first time that “**strict liability**” should be presumed at common law to be the **default level of mental fault for regulatory offences**. It bridges the gap between no fault requirement (absolute liability) and “full *mens rea*” (for criminal offences).

In ***Lévis (City) v. Tétreault; Lévis (City) v. 2629-4470 Québec inc.***, [2006 SCC 12](https://canlii.ca/t/1n0zk){:target=" \_blank"}, the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed the decision in ***R. v. City of Sault Ste. Marie*** and indicated that while it is still possible to have absolute liability offences if there is “clear proof of legislative intent”, such offences are now quite rare.

**Full Mens Rea**

Although **regulatory offences** are presumed to be strict liability, they are **capable of requiring “full *mens rea*”** as would a true criminal offence. 

This occurs when the otherwise regulatory provision has **express language** requiring a higher level of mental fault. For example, the provision might require that the Accused commit the act “**knowingly**”, or with “**intent**” or “**purpose**”.

**Chapter 7: REGULATORY OFFENCES AND ABSOLUTE AND STRICT LIABILITY**

**Regulatory offences** can be enacted by **all levels of government** in the discharge of their regulatory duties over safety, the environment, and a wide range of other subjects. They far **out-number crimes enacted by the federal Parliament** in its exclusive jurisdiction to enact criminal offences.

**I. THE IMPORTANCE AND CONTEXT OF REGULATORY OFFENCES**

The following extract from Cory J’s judgment in ***Wholesale Travel Group Inc***, grapples with the distinction between “true criminal offences” and “regulatory offences.”

!!! info "*R. v. Wholesale Travel Group Inc.*, [1991 CanLII 39 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fsjf){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - **A. The Distinction Between Crimes and Regulatory Offences**
    - In ***Sherras v. De Rutzen***, [1895] 1 Q.B. 918 at p. 922, it was held that, 
        - while the *mens rea* presumption applied to true crimes because of the fault and moral culpability which they imply, that same presumption did not apply to offences “which ... are not criminal in any real sense, but are acts which in the public interest are prohibited under a penalty.”
    - This case illustrates the essential distinction in the legal treatment of regulatory as opposed to criminal offences, namely, the **removal** of the *mens rea* requirement. 
    - ***R. v. Sault Ste. Marie***, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299, affirmed the distinction between regulatory offences and true crimes.
        - such offences, although enforced as penal laws through the machinery of the criminal law, “are in substance of a civil nature and might well be regarded as a branch of administrative law to which traditional principles of criminal law have but limited application.” 
    - The ***Sault Ste. Marie*** case recognized **strict liability** as a middle ground between full *mens rea* and absolute liability. 
        - Where the offence is one of strict liability, the Crown is required to prove neither *mens rea* nor negligence; conviction may follow merely upon proof **beyond a reasonable doubt** of the **proscribed act**. 
        - However, it is open to the defendant to avoid liability by proving **on a balance of probabilities** that all due care was taken. 
        - This is the hallmark of the strict liability offence: **the defence of due diligence**. 
    - The new category of strict liability represented a **compromise** which acknowledged the importance and essential objectives of regulatory offences but at the same time sought to mitigate the harshness of absolute liability which was found, at p. 1311, to “violate” fundamental principles of penal liability.
    - **The Rationale for the Distinction**
    - The **objective** of regulatory legislation is to protect the public or broad segments of the public (such as employees, consumers and motorists, to name but a few) from the potentially adverse effects of otherwise lawful activity. 
    - While criminal offences are usually designed to condemn and punish past, inherently wrongful conduct, regulatory measures are generally **directed** to the prevention of future harm through the enforcement of minimum standards of conduct and care. 
    - Most recently, in ***Thomson Newspapers Ltd. v. Canada (Director of Investigation and Research, Restrictive Trade Practices Commission)***, [1990 CanLII 135 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fsz8){:target=" \_blank"}, at pp. 510-11, Justice La Forest:
        - [The regulatory offence] is not primarily concerned with values, but with results. ... The object is to induce compliance with rules for the overall benefit of society.
    - **B. The Fundamental Importance of Regulatory Offences in Canadian Society**
    - Regulatory measures are the primary mechanisms employed by governments in Canada to implement public policy objectives. In short, regulation is absolutely essential for our protection and well being as individuals, and for the effective functioning of society. 

**II. THE EARLY FAULT BINARY: ABSOLUTE LIABILITY OR SUBJECTIVE FAULT?**

!!! info "*R. v. Pierce Fisheries Ltd.*, [1970 CanLII 178 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1xd31){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - ... I am of opinion that the offence created by s. 3(1)(b) of the *Regulations* falls within the first class of exceptions referred to by Wright J., in ***Sherras v. De Rutzen***, ... and that it should be construed in accordance with the language in which it was enacted, free from any presumption as to the requirement of *mens rea*. 
    - In considering the language of the *Regulation*, s. 3(1)(b), it is significant, though not conclusive, that it contains no such words as “**knowingly**,” “**wilfully**,” “**with intent**” or “**without lawful excuse**,” whereas such words occur in a number of sections of the *Fisheries Act* itself which create offences for which *mens rea* is made an essential ingredient.

**III. THE EMERGENCE OF STRICT LIABILITY**

!!! info "*R. v. Sault Ste. Marie*, [1978 CanLII 11 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1mkbt){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - Although enforced as penal laws through the utilization of the machinery of the criminal law, the offences are in substance of a **civil nature** and might well be regarded as **a branch of administrative law** to which traditional principles of criminal law have but limited application.
    - Where the offence is **criminal**, the Crown must establish **a mental element**, namely, that the accused who committed the prohibited act did so intentionally or recklessly, with knowledge of the facts constituting the offence, or with wilful blindness toward them. **Mere negligence is excluded** from the concept of the mental element required for conviction.
    - In sharp contrast, “absolute liability” entails conviction on proof merely that the defendant committed the **prohibited act** constituting the *actus reus* of the offence. There is no relevant mental element. It is **no defence** that the accused was entirely without fault.
    - The unfortunate tendency in many past cases has been to see the choice as between **two stark alternatives**: (i) full *mens rea*; or (ii) absolute liability. ... There has, however, been an attempt in Australia, in many Canadian Courts, and indeed in England, to **seek a middle position**, fulfilling the goals of public welfare offences while still not punishing the entirely blameless. There is an increasing and impressive stream of authority which holds that where an offence **does not require full *mens rea***, it is nevertheless a good defence for the defendant to **prove that he was not negligent**. 
    - The correct approach, in my opinion, is to **relieve the Crown of the burden** of proving *mens rea*, having regard to ***Pierce Fisheries*** and to the virtual impossibility in most regulatory cases of proving wrongful intention. Equally, there is nothing wrong with **rejecting absolute liability and admitting the defence of reasonable care**. 
    - it is open to the defendant to prove that all due care has been taken. This **burden falls upon the defendant** as he is the only one who will generally have the means of proof. This would not seem unfair as the alternative is absolute liability which denies an accused any defence whatsoever. While the prosecution must prove **beyond a reasonable doubt** that the defendant committed the prohibited act, the defendant must only establish o**n the balance of probabilities** that he has a defence of reasonable care. 
    - I conclude, for the reasons which I have sought to express, that there are compelling grounds for the recognition of **three categories of offences** rather than the traditional two:
        - **Offences** in which *mens rea*, consisting of some positive state of mind such as intent, knowledge, or recklessness, must be proved by the prosecution either as an inference from the nature of the act committed, or by additional evidence.
        - **Offences** in which there is no necessity for the prosecution to prove the existence of *mens rea*; the doing of the prohibited act *prima facie* imports the offence, leaving it open to the accused to avoid liability by proving that he took all reasonable care. 
        - **Offences of absolute liability** where it is not open to the accused to exculpate himself by showing that he was free of fault.

As will been seen, the ***Sault Ste Marie*** compromise of strict liability formulated in 1978 was challenged as inconsistent with the rights of the accused under the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*. It has survived these *Charter* challenges, and the Supreme Court affirmed in 2006 that it would apply the “clear analytical framework and classification approach adopted in ***Sault Ste. Marie***” (at para 19) and that while “**absolute liability** offences still exist ... they have become an **exception** requiring clear proof of legislative intent” (at para 17). ***Lévis (City) v. Tétreault; Lévis (City) v. 2629-4470 Québec inc.***, [2006 SCC 12](https://canlii.ca/t/1n0zk){:target=" \_blank"}. 

**IV. CONSTITUTIONAL CONSIDERATIONS FOR FAULT IN REGULATORY OFFENCES**

!!! info "*Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act*, [1985 CanLII 81 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/dln){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - A law that has the potential to convict a person who has not really done anything wrong offends the principles of fundamental justice and, if imprisonment is available as a penalty, such a law then violates a person’s right to liberty under s. 7 of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* (Part I of the *Constitution Act*, 1982, as enacted by the *Canada Act*, 1982 (U.K.), c. 11). In other words, **absolute liability and imprisonment cannot be combined**.
    - It has from time immemorial been part of our system of laws that the innocent not be punished. It is so old that its first enunciation was in Latin ***actus non facit reum nisi mens sit rea***.
    - A law enacting an **absolute liability** offence will violate s. 7 of the *Charter* **only if** and to the extent that it has the potential of **depriving of life, liberty, or security of the person**. 
    - ... no imprisonment may be imposed for an absolute liability offence, and, consequently, given the question put to us, an offence punishable by imprisonment cannot be an absolute liability offence. 
    - ... absolute liability does not *per se* violate s. 7 of the *Charter* ... in penal law, absolute liability always offends the **principles of fundamental justice** irrespective of the nature of the offence; it offends s. 7 of the *Charter* if as a result, anyone is deprived of his life, liberty or security of the person, irrespective of the requirement of public interest. In such cases it might only be salvaged for reasons of public interest under s. 1. 
    - **Comment:** The Court subsequently held that **corporations do not enjoy s 7 rights** in ***Irwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec (Attorney General)***, [1989 CanLII 87 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1ft6g){:target=" \_blank"}. At the same time, corporations charged with an offence that also applies to natural persons can still challenge the offence under s 7 as well as other rights under the *Charter*. That is why a corporation was able to challenge regulatory offences under s 7 of the *Charter* in ***R. v. Wholesale Travel Group Inc.***, [1991 CanLII 39 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fsjf){:target=" \_blank"}. Note that the rights in **s 11** of the *Charter*, including the presumption of innocence in s 11(d) of the *Charter*, **apply to all** those charged with an offence, including corporations.

## 4.3 Subjective vs. Objective Fault

Four different types of “*subjective fault*” (often referred to simply as *mens rea*): **intention**, **recklessness**, **knowledge**, and **wilful blindness**.
