## 2.1 The Onus & Standard of Proof

**Onus of Proof (a.k.a. Burden of Proof)**

The onus of proof (sometimes called the burden of proof) refers to who has the **obligation to prove an issue in a criminal trial**. The onus of proof will fall on either the Crown or the Defence for each disputed issue that arises during a trial. **The main onus of proof in criminal matters is the Crown’s onus** to prove the offence charged and to establish the Accused’s guilt. 

Some onuses fall on the Defence. For example, if an Accused asserts a defence such as necessity, duress or self-defence, it is they who have the onus of proving its applicability.

There are also situations where an onus of proof can shift back and forth between the Crown and an Accused. 

**Standard of Proof**

The standard of proof refers to **how much evidence the Crown or Defence must present in order to prove an issue** in a criminal trial. The **highest** standard of proof in Canadian criminal law is **proof beyond a reasonable doubt**. This is the overarching standard to which Crown must prove the offence charged and the Accused’s guilt.

Lesser standards of proof may also apply in criminal proceedings. These can include “reasonable grounds”, “reasonable and probable grounds”, “some credible evidence” or “a balance of probabilities”. These lesser standards require that less evidence be put before the court and are therefore easier for the party with the onus of proof to meet.

**Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt**

The decision in ***R. v. Lifchus***, [1997 CanLII 319 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fqzt){:target=" \_blank"} is a leading case setting out the meaning of “proof beyond a reasonable doubt”. As you read the case, consider how Justice Cory defines the concept by what it does not mean, and then by what it does mean. Then read the subsequent case of ***R. v. Starr***, [2000 SCC 40](https://canlii.ca/t/525l){:target=" \_blank"} to see how the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada has been strict in requiring compliance with the ***Lifchus*** description of “proof beyond a reasonable doubt”.

!!! info "*Lifchus*"

    - 36 Perhaps a brief summary of what the definition should and should not contain may be helpful. **It should be explained that:**
        - the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is inextricably **intertwined** with that principle fundamental to all criminal trials, the presumption of innocence;
        - the burden of proof rests on the **prosecution** throughout the trial and never shifts to the accused;
        - a reasonable doubt is **not a doubt based upon sympathy or prejudice**;
        - rather, it is based upon **reason and common sense**;
        - it is logically connected to the **evidence or absence of evidence**;
        - it does not involve proof to an **absolute certainty**; it is not proof beyond any doubt nor is it an imaginary or frivolous doubt; and
        - more is required than proof that the accused is probably guilty - a jury which concludes only that the accused is **probably guilty must acquit**.
    - 37 On the other hand, certain references to the required standard of proof should be **avoided**. For example:
        - describing the term “reasonable doubt” as an ordinary expression which has no special meaning in the criminal law context;
        - inviting jurors to apply to the task before them the same standard of proof that they apply to important, or even the most important, decisions in their own lives;
        - equating proof “beyond a reasonable doubt” to proof “to a moral certainty”;
        - qualifying the word “doubt” with adjectives other than “reasonable”, such as “serious”,  “substantial” or “haunting”, which may mislead the jury; and
        - instructing jurors that they may convict if they are “sure” that the accused is guilty, before providing them with a proper definition as to the meaning of the words “beyond a reasonable doubt”.

!!! info "*Starr*"

    - 82 In ***Lifchus***, at para. 22, this Court held that the expression “beyond a reasonable doubt” must be explained to a jury.  In four different manners, Cory J. articulated guidelines for how trial judges should go about explaining this concept to a jury.  
        - First, he discussed what should be avoided (at paras. 23-26).  
        - Second, Cory J. explained what should be included in the definition of reasonable doubt (at paras. 27-35).  
        - Third, Cory J. provided a summary of what the definition “should and should not contain” (at paras. 36 and 37).  
        - Finally, Cory J. offered a suggested charge for trial judges to use in explaining the concept of reasonable doubt to a jury (at para. 39).
    - 83 **Several matters are noteworthy about Cory J.’s reasons** in ***Lifchus*** as set out above.  
        - First, in grappling with the issue of whether reasonable doubt must be explained to a jury, Cory J. acknowledged the confusing nature of this term and implicitly recognized the challenge facing trial judges in articulating it to a jury.  
        - 84 Second, I believe it is notable that in articulating how the expression “reasonable doubt” should be explained to the jury, Cory J. generally employed the words “should” and “should not” rather than the imperative “must” and “must not”.  I cannot believe that Cory J. intended to use “should” and “must” interchangeably so as to make his list of items that “should be avoided” equivalent to a list of items that are prohibited and the inclusion of which automatically constitutes reversible error.  I find support for this position in Cory J.’s statement that the equation of the term “moral certainty” with “reasonable doubt” in a trial judge’s charge to the jury “although not necessarily fatal to a charge on reasonable doubt, should be avoided” (para. 25 (emphasis added)).
        - Third, Cory J. stated expressly that “[a]ny form of instruction that complied with the applicable principles and avoided the pitfalls referred to would be satisfactory” (para. 40).  He did not view his suggested charge as a “magic incantation that needs to be repeated word for word” (para. 40).
        - 86 Fourth, and most importantly, Cory J. expressly stated that “an **error** in the instructions as to the standard of proof may not constitute a reversible error” (para.  41).  He reiterated this Court’s statement in ***R. v. W. (D.)***, 1991 CanLII 93 (SCC), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, at p. 758, that the verdict ought not be disturbed “if the charge, when read as a whole, makes it clear that the jury could not have been under any misapprehension as to the correct burden and standard of proof to apply”.  Cory J. explained that “[o]n the other hand, if the charge as a whole gives rise to the reasonable likelihood that the jury misapprehended the standard of proof, then **as a general rule the verdict will have to be set aside and a new trial directed**” (para. 41).
    - 87 **Two further annotations** to ***Lifchus*** are necessary.  ***Lifchus***, at para. 27,  emphasized the need for the trial judge to link the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to
  
        > that basic premise which is fundamental to all criminal trials: the presumption of innocence.  T**he two concepts are forever as closely linked** as Romeo with Juliet or Oberon with Titania and they must be presented together as a unit . . . Jurors must be reminded that the **burden** of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the crime **rests with the prosecution throughout the trial and never shifts to the accused**. 

        In addition, Cory J. stated that jurors “must be advised that the Crown is **not required to prove its case to an absolute certainty** since such an unrealistically high standard could seldom be achieved” (para. 31).

**Presumption of Innocence at Common Law**

The presumption of innocence is one of the most fundamental protections afforded to accused persons in our system of criminal law. It puts the onus on the Crown to prove the guilt of individuals that it seeks to punish, rather than the other way around.

This speech by Viscount Sankey L.C. for the House of Lords in ***Woolmington v. D.P.P.***, [1935] A.C. 462 is a leading common law case that has been cited by Canadian courts on the presumption of innocence. 

**Section 11(d)** of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* enshrined the presumption of innocence in our constitutional law. It states:

> Any person charged with an offence has the right ... to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal.

If this right is infringed, the party seeking to uphold the infringement has the onus of proof (on a balance of probabilities) to justify it under **section 1** of the *Charter*, which states:

> The *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it subject only to such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.

In ***R. v. Keegstra***, [1990 CanLII 24 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fsr1){:target=" \_blank"}, the Supreme Court of Canada split on the issue of whether the infringement of section 11(d) of the *Charter* could be justified under section 1 of the *Charter*. Read the reasons of **Chief Justice Dickson** (for the majority) and **Justice McLachlin** (as she then was) in dissent.

In ***R. v. Downey***, [1992 CanLII 109 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fsbb){:target=" \_blank"}, **Justice Cory** provides **a concise summary of the jurisprudence** on the presumption of innocence under section 11(d) of the *Charter*.

## Discussion Activity: ***R. v. Keegstra***

Please post a message on the Discussion Forum for Unit 2 with your opinion about whether you find the reasons of either Chief Justice Dickson (for the majority) or Justice McLachlin (as she then was) in dissent more persuasive in ***Keegstra***. 

Did section 319(2) violate Keegstra’s presumption of innocence, and if so, was that violation justified under s.1 of the *Charter*?

!!! quote "Answer"

    - One of the legal issues in ***Keegstra*** is whether sections 319(2) and 319(3)(a) of the *Criminal Code* violate the presumption of innocence principle in the common law and section 11(d) of the *Charter*, and thus reverse the burden of proof from the prosecution to the accused.
    - Section 319(2) and 319(3)(a) provide:
    - (2) Every one who, by communicating statements, other than in private conversation, wilfully promotes hatred against any identifiable group is guilty of
        - (a) an indictable offence and is liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years; or
        - (b) an offence punishable on summary conviction.
    (3) No person shall be convicted of an offence under subsection (2)
            (a) if he establishes that the statements communicated were true;
    - Both the majority and dissenting justices found that the provisions violate section 11(d) of the *Charter*, but they diverge in the second phase of the analysis. 
    - The majority held that the violation is justified under section 1, while the dissents argued that it could not be saved by section 1 because there lacks a “rational connection” between the aims of s. 319(3)(a) and its requirement that the accused prove the truth of his statements, and because the effects of the infringement and the objectives it promotes raise proportionality concerns.
    - Despite the dissenting judges’ persuasive arguments, I agree more with the majority. Hate speech and its promotion are so poisonous to a healthy and harmonious society that certain precautions must be laid out to curb such irresponsible actions. As the Court said, the crucial objective of Parliament in this appeal justifies requiring a more convincing demonstration that a hate-monger’s statements may be true, as a successful defence provides an excuse despite the presence of the harm sought to be eradicated. Having the accused prove truthfulness on the balance of probabilities is an understandable and valuable precaution against too easily justifying such harm. Thus, as the majority concluded, the reverse-onus provision in s. 319(3)(a) represents a minimal impairment of the presumption of innocence.

**Pages 325 "Burden of Proof" to the end of the Woolmington case, pages 334 to 341**

**V. QUANTUM AND BURDEN OF PROOF**

The burden on the Crown to prove the guilt of an accused beyond a reasonable doubt is one of the most important safeguards in the criminal justice system. 

!!! info "*Woolmington v DPP*, [1935] AC 462 (HL)"

    - Throughout the web of the English Criminal Law one golden thread is always to be seen, that it is the **duty of the prosecution to prove the prisoner’s guilt** subject to ... the defence of insanity and subject also to any statutory exception. 
    - No matter what the charge or where the trial, the principle that the prosecution must prove the guilt of the prisoner is part of the common law of England and no attempt to whittle it down can be entertained. 
    - When dealing with a murder case the Crown must prove 
        - (a) death as a result of a voluntary act of the accused and 
        - (b) malice of the accused. It may prove malice either expressly or by implication. 
    - When evidence of death and malice has been given (this is a question for the jury) the accused is entitled to show, by evidence or by examination of the circumstances adduced by the Crown that the act on his part which caused death was either unintentional or provoked. If the jury are either satisfied with his explanation or, upon a review of all the evidence, are **left in reasonable doubt** whether, even if his explanation be not accepted, the act was unintentional or provoked, the prisoner is entitled to be **acquitted**. 

**C. PRESUMPTION OF INNOCENCE APPLIES TO DEFENCE AND TO ELEMENTS OF OFFENCE** 

In ***R. v. Whyte***, [1988 CanLII 47 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1ftd1){:target=" \_blank"}, the Supreme Court rejected a Crown argument that would have limited the presumption of innocence to the elements of the offence. **Chief Justice Dickson** stated for the Court (at paras 31-32) that 

> the distinction between elements of the offence and other aspects of the charge is irrelevant to the **s. 11(d)** inquiry. The real concern is not whether the accused must disprove an element or prove an excuse, but that an accused may be convicted while a reasonable doubt exists. When that possibility exists, there is a breach of the presumption of innocence. 
> 
> If an accused is required to prove some fact on the balance of probabilities to avoid conviction, the provision violates the presumption of innocence because it permits a conviction in spite of a reasonable doubt in the mind of the trier of fact as to the guilt of the accused.

!!! info "*R. v. Keegstra*, [1990 CanLII 24 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fsr1){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - **Majority:**
    - s 319(3)(a) infringed the presumption of innocence under s 11(d) of the Charter, **but** that the infringement was a reasonable limit on the presumption of innocence that was justified under s 1 of the Charter.
    - in ***R. v. Whyte***, [1988 CanLII 47 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1ftd1){:target=" \_blank"} it is clear that the presumption of innocence is infringed whenever the accused is liable to be convicted despite the existence of a reasonable doubt as to guilt in the mind of the trier of fact.
    - Yet to my mind the crucial objective of Parliament in this appeal justifies **requiring a more convincing demonstration** that a hate-monger’s statements may be true, as a successful defence provides an excuse despite the presence of the harm sought to be eradicated. Having the accused prove truthfulness on the balance of probabilities is an understandable and valued precaution against too easily justifying such harm, and I hence conclude that the reverse onus provision in s. 319(3)(a) represents **a minimal impairment** of the presumption of innocence.
    - **McLACHLIN J (Sopinka and La Forest JJ concurring) (in dissent):**
    - A **rational connection** between the aims of s. 319(3)(a) and its requirement that the accused prove the truth of his statements is difficult to discern. 
    - Similar considerations arise on the question of whether s. 319(3)(a) of the *Criminal Code* impairs the presumption of innocence under s. 11(d) as little as possible. 
    - The final test of **proportionality** between the effects of the infringement and the objectives it promotes encounters other difficulties. We must start from the proposition that Parliament intended the truth to be a defence and that falsehood is an important element of the offence created by s. 319(2) of the *Criminal Code*. That fact, coupled with the centrality of the presumption of innocence in our criminal law, suggests that only a countervailing state interest of the most compelling kind could justify the infringement. But, ... it is difficult to see what benefits s. 319(2) in fact produces in terms of stemming hate propaganda and promoting social harmony and individual dignity. ... I conclude that s. 319(3)(a) is not saved by s. 1 of the *Charter*.

In ***R v Downey***, [1992] 2 SCR 10 at 29, **Cory J** provided the following summary of the principles that emerged from the s 11(d) jurisprudence to date:

1. The presumption of innocence is infringed whenever the accused is liable to be convicted despite the existence of a reasonable doubt.
2. If by the provisions of a statutory presumption, an accused is required to establish, that is to say to prove or disprove, on a balance of probabilities either an element of an offence or an excuse, then it contravenes s. 11(d). Such a provision would permit a conviction in spite of a reasonable doubt.
3. Even if a rational connection exists between the established fact and the fact to be presumed, this would be insufficient to make valid a presumption requiring the accused to disprove an element of the offence.
4. Legislation which substitutes proof of one element for proof of an essential element will not infringe the presumption of innocence if as a result of the proof of the substituted element, it would be unreasonable for the trier of fact not to be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt of the existence of the other element. To put it another way, the statutory presumption will be valid if the proof of the substituted fact leads inexorably to the proof of the other. However, the statutory presumption will infringe s. 11(d) if it requires the trier of fact to convict in spite of a reasonable doubt.
5. A permissive assumption from which a trier of fact may but not must draw an inference of guilt will not infringe s. 11(d).
6. A provision that might have been intended to play a minor role in providing relief from conviction will none the less contravene the *Charter* if the provision (such as the truth of a statement) must be established by the accused (see ***Keegstra***, *supra*).
7. It must of course be remembered that statutory presumptions which infringe s 11(d) may still be justified pursuant to s. 1 of the *Charter*. (As, for example, in ***Keegstra***, *supra*.)

**D. QUANTUM OF PROOF**

!!! info "*R. v. Lifchus*, [1997 CanLII 319 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fqzt){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - [36] (See above referenced.)
    - [37] (See above referenced.)
    - [38] ... Nevertheless, it may, as suggested in [***R v Girard (1996)***, 109 CCC (3d) 545 (Qc CA)], at p. 556, be useful to set out a “**model charge**” which could provide the necessary instructions as to the meaning of the phrase beyond a reasonable doubt. 
    - [39] Instructions pertaining to the requisite standard of proof in a criminal trial of proof beyond a reasonable doubt might be given along these lines:
        
        > The accused enters these proceedings presumed to be innocent. That presumption of innocence remains throughout the case until such time as the Crown has on the evidence put before you satisfied you beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused is guilty.

        > What does the expression “beyond a reasonable doubt” mean?
        
        > The term “beyond a reasonable doubt” has been used for a very long time and is a part of our history and traditions of justice. It is so engrained in our criminal law that some think it needs no explanation, yet something must be said regarding its meaning. 
        
        > A reasonable doubt is not an imaginary or frivolous doubt. It must not be based upon sympathy or prejudice. Rather, it is based on reason and common sense. It is logically derived from the evidence or absence of evidence. 
        
        > **Even if you believe the accused is probably guilty or likely guilty, that is not sufficient.** In those circumstances you must **give the benefit of the doubt to the accused** and acquit because the Crown has failed to satisfy you of the guilt of the accused beyond a reasonable doubt.
        
        > On the other hand you must remember that it is virtually impossible to prove anything to an absolute certainty and the Crown is not required to do so. Such a standard of proof is impossibly high. 
        
        > In short if, based upon the evidence before the court, you are sure that the accused committed the offence you should convict since this demonstrates that you are satisfied of his guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

!!! info "*R. v. Starr*, [2000 SCC 40](https://canlii.ca/t/525l){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - [107] With respect to the jury instructions on the phrase “beyond a reasonable doubt,” as set out in ***Lifchus***, *supra*, an instruction like the one in this case, which fails to explain that the beyond a reasonable doubt standard has special legal significance and requires a significantly higher quantum of proof than the balance of probabilities, will not satisfy the ***Lifchus*** standard. 
    - [239] The key difficulty with this instruction is that it was not made clear to the jury that the Crown was required to do more than prove the appellant’s guilt on a balance of probabilities. 
    - [241] The error in the charge is that the jury was not told how a reasonable doubt is to be defined. As was emphasized repeatedly in ***Lifchus*** ... , a jury must be instructed that the standard of proof in a criminal trial is **higher than** the probability standard used in making everyday decisions and in civil trials. Unlike absolute certainty or the balance of probabilities, reasonable doubt is not an easily quantifiable standard. 
    - [242] ... it falls much closer to absolute certainty than to proof on a balance of probabilities. As stated in Lifchus, a trial judge is required to explain that something less than absolute certainty is required, and that something more than probable guilt is required, in order for the jury to convict. It will be of great assistance for a jury if the trial judge situates the reasonable doubt standard appropriately between these two standards. I am in agreement with Twaddle J.A. in the court below, when he said, at p. 177:

        > If standards of proof were marked on a measure, proof “beyond reasonable doubt” would lie much closer to “absolute certainty” than to “a balance of probabilities.” 

<p class="highlight green" markdown="1">**Note:** that standard jury instructions that trial judges rely on in formulating their charges to the jury now replicate the charge in ***Lifchus***, often **supplemented by an explanation**, inspired by ***Starr***, that **proof beyond a reasonable doubt is closer to certainty than probability**. </p>

## 2.2 Judges and Juries

**Introduction**

Criminal proceedings in Canada are presided over by independent judges who are appointed to their positions. Judicial independence and impartiality are considered central to our democracy and have been recognized as having constitutional status.  **Our system of criminal law also uses juries in some instances during trials.**

**Judges**

Crown Counsel can charge an Accused either by **summary conviction** or by **indictment** (“in-dite-ment”). 

- Summary conviction charges are usually reserved for less serious offences, and these matters are heard in Provincial Court before a Provincial Court judge. 
- Indictable matters (cases where Crown has “proceeded by indictment”) are more serious and often the Accused may elect whether to be tried in Provincial Court before a Provincial Court judge or in provincial B.C. Supreme Court before a judge alone or before a judge and jury. In every instance though, the criminal trial is presided over by a judge.

A judge acting alone has the task of determining whether the Accused is guilty of the offence that s/he is charged with and, if so, what the appropriate sentence should be. In jury trials, the judge rules on preliminary (before trial) applications, makes rulings on evidentiary and procedural issues during the trial, and explains the law to the jury before they go deliberate and make their finding of guilt or acquittal. Judges also determine sentence in jury trials.

!!! info "[An Independent and Impartial Judiciary](https://cscja.ca/judicial-independence/){:target=" \_blank"}"

    While governments appoint and pay judges, once appointed, judges are shielded from bureaucratic control. Judges must be able to make courageous, even unpopular decisions knowing that no one, a chief justice, another judge, a government official or even the most powerful politician, can fire them or cut their salaries as retaliation.

    This independence is vital to fostering public confidence in the fairness and objectivity of the justice system. Three principles protect it:

    - **Administrative independence:** Judges oversee the administration of the courts; the government does not set hearing dates or assign a judge to a particular case.
    - **Financial security:** An independent body, the Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission, reviews judges’ salaries, benefits and retirement annuities, and recommends improvements and changes.
    - **Security of tenure:** Judges can remain on the bench until retirement; they cannot be removed from office unless an independent investigation determines they are unfit or guilty of misconduct.

    In addition to independence, judges are expected to maintain **integrity** and **impartiality**. The Canadian Judicial Council developed a set of Ethical Principles for Judges to provide guidance.

**Juries**

**In a jury trial, the jury decides the facts of the case and ultimately, whether the Accused is guilty.** In making their determination, the jury has to apply the instructions that they received from the judge. If the jury finds the Accused guilty of one or more offences, then the judge will determine the appropriate sentence.

Section 11(f) of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* gives an Accused the right to a jury trial for serious offences as follows:

> 11 Any person charged with an offence has the right

> (f) except in the case of an offence under military law tried before a military tribunal, to the benefit of trial by jury where the maximum punishment for the offence is imprisonment for five years or a more severe punishment;

!!! info "***R. v. Gunning***, [2005 SCC 27](https://canlii.ca/t/1kt5b){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - **C. The Respective Functions of the Judge and the Jury**
    - 27 It is perhaps trite but nonetheless fundamental law that on a jury trial, it is for the judge to decide all questions of law and to direct the jury accordingly; but the **jury**, who must take its direction on the law from the judge, is the **sole arbiter on the facts**. The judge also has the duty, insofar as it is necessary, to assist the jury by reviewing the evidence as it relates to the issues in the case. The judge is also entitled to give an opinion on a question of fact and express it as strongly as the circumstances permit, so long as it is made clear to the jury that the opinion is given as advice and not direction.
    - 28 Subject to one exception, it is also the **exclusive domain of the jury to determine the verdict**. An exception lies where the judge is satisfied that there is no evidence upon which a properly instructed jury could reasonably convict, in which case, it is the judge’s duty to direct the jury to acquit the accused. This exception is made in order to safeguard against wrongful convictions. **However, there is no corresponding duty or entitlement to direct a jury to return a verdict of guilty.** As **Lord Devlin** so aptly put it in ***Chandler v. Director of Public Prosecutions***, [1964] A.C. 763 (H.L.), in answer to the argument that it should be open to the judge to direct a verdict of guilty in certain circumstances:

        > With great respect I think that to be an unconstitutional doctrine. It is the conscience of the jury and not the power of the judge that provides the constitutional safeguard against perverse acquittal. [pp. 803-4]

        See ***R. v. Wang***, [2005] 1 All E.R. 782, [2005] UKHL 9, for an instructive analysis on why a judge under English law is not entitled to direct a jury to return a verdict of guilty. The principles discussed in Wang are all the more applicable in Canadian law where the accused exercises his constitutional right to the benefit of a trial by jury: s. 11(f) of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*.

    - 29 As a corollary of the trial judge’s duty to instruct the jury on the law, it is a well-established principle that a judge should withdraw a defence from the consideration of the jury when there is no evidence upon which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could find in the accused’s favour. In these circumstances, it only stands to reason that there is no need to direct the jury on an issue not raised in the case. It would only serve to confuse the jury and detract from their duty to return a true verdict. This threshold test, requiring that **a defence be put to the jury only if there is an evidential foundation for it**, is often referred to as the **“air of reality” test**.
    - 30 It is important to note that the “air of reality” test has no application in respect of the question of whether the Crown has proved beyond a reasonable doubt each essential element of the offence. By his plea of not guilty, the accused in effect advances the “defence” that the Crown has not met its burden in respect of one or more of the necessary ingredients of the offence. In every trial where there is no plea of guilty or an admission by the accused as to one or more of the essential elements of the offence, **the question of whether the Crown has met its burden is necessarily at play and must be put to the jury for its determination.** This “defence” is squarely before the jury. There is no further threshold to meet. The imposition of any additional hurdle would run counter to both the presumption of innocence and the burden of proof on the Crown.
    - 31 Hence, **it is never the function of the judge in a jury trial to assess the evidence and make a determination that the Crown has proven one or more of the essential elements of the offence and to direct the jury accordingly.** It does not matter how obvious the judge may believe the answer to be. Nor does it matter that the judge may be of the view that any other conclusion would be perverse. The trial judge may give an opinion on the matter when it is warranted, but never a direction. 
    - 32 The “air of reality” test applies, rather, in respect of affirmative defences that may or may not arise depending on the particular facts. For example, it is not in every case that defences such as the following will arise: intoxication, necessity, duress, provocation, alibi, automatism, self-defence, mistake of fact, honest but mistaken belief in consent or defence of property. It is not incumbent on the Crown in every trial to negative all conceivable defences no matter how fanciful or speculative they may be. A certain threshold must be met before the issue is “put in play”: ***R. v. Cinous***, [2002] 2 S.C.R. 3, 2002 SCC 29, at para. 52. A defence will be in play whenever a properly instructed jury could reasonably, on account of the evidence, conclude in favour of the accused: ***R. v. Fontaine***, [2004] 1 S.C.R. 702, 2004 SCC 27, at para. 74.
    - 33 The basic features of the “air of reality” test and the evidential standard that must be met were thoroughly canvassed by this Court in ***Cinous*** and the analysis need not be repeated here. In the context of this case, it is important, however, to repeat what the threshold test is not aimed at. At para. 54, McLachlin C.J. and Bastarache J. stated:

        > The threshold determination by the trial judge is not aimed at **deciding the substantive merits of the defence. That question is reserved for the jury**. See ***Finta***, *supra*; ***R. v. Ewanchuk***, 1999 CanLII 711 (SCC), [1999] 1 S.C.R. 330. 
        
        > The trial judge does not make determinations about the credibility of witnesses, weigh the evidence, make findings of fact, or draw determinate factual inferences. See ***R. v. Bulmer***, 1987 CanLII 56 (SCC), [1987] 1 S.C.R. 782; ***Park***, *supra*. Nor is the air of reality test intended to assess whether the defence is likely, unlikely, somewhat likely, or very likely to succeed at the end of the day. 
        
        > The question for the trial judge is whether the evidence discloses a real issue to be decided by the jury, and not how the jury should ultimately decide the issue.

## 2.3 Crown Prosecutors

**Both lawyers** representing the Crown (the Prosecutor) and the Accused (Defence Counsel) introduce evidence and make submissions on the facts an on the law.

**A Crown Prosecutor’s Role & Duties**

A Crown Prosecutor’s role is not to secure convictions. His or her role is a public duty to **help the court arrive at a just result**. Per ***Boucher v. The Queen***, [1954 CanLII 3 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1nlk7){:target=" \_blank"} at para. 24:

> It cannot be over-emphasized that the purpose of a criminal prosecution is not to obtain a conviction, it is to lay before a jury what the Crown considers to be credible evidence relevant to what is alleged to be a crime. The role of prosecutor excludes any notion of winning or losing; his function is a matter of public duty than which in civil life there can be none charged with greater personal responsibility. It is to be efficiently performed with an ingrained sense of the dignity, the seriousness and the just­ness of judicial proceedings.

***Boucher*** remains a leading Supreme Court of Canada decision on the role of the Crown Prosecutor. As you read the decision, think about why Justice Rand found the Crown’s statement to the jury to be problematic.

!!! info "*Boucher*"

    - It is the duty of the Crown, when an affair like that happens, no matter what affair, and still more in a serious affair, to make every possible investigation, and if in the course of these investigations with our experts, the conclusion is come to that the accused is not guilty or that there is a reasonable doubt, it is the duty of the Crown, gentlemen, to say so, or if the conclusion is come to that he is not guilty, not to make an arrest. That is what was done here. 
    - When the Crown put in that evidence, it is not with the intention of bearing down on the accused, it was with the intention of **rendering justice** to him. 
    - It cannot be over-emphasized that the purpose of a criminal prosecution is not to obtain a conviction ...

**Prosecutorial Discretion**

Note that in Canada prosecutors are not elected. Rather, they work in large provincial and federal bureaucracies subject to the direction of an **attorney general** and, in some jurisdictions, **a director of public prosecutions**. But they remain very powerful. 

In the following case, the Supreme Court of Canada rejected the proposition that prosecutors (often called Crown counsel in Canada) have a constitutional responsibility to consider the Aboriginal status of an accused when deciding whether to seek a mandatory minimum sentence.

This case, ***R. v. Anderson***, [2014 SCC 41](https://canlii.ca/t/g784t){:target=" \_blank"}, provides an overview of “prosecutorial discretion”.

!!! info "*Anderson*"

    - [1] This appeal raises the following question: Are Crown prosecutors constitutionally required to consider the Aboriginal status of an accused when deciding whether or not to seek a mandatory minimum sentence for impaired driving? The answer, in my view, must be no. There is no principle of fundamental justice that supports the existence of such a constitutional obligation. Absent such an obligation, **the prosecutor’s decision is a matter of prosecutorial discretion which is reviewable by the courts only for abuse of process**. 
    - [37] This Court has repeatedly affirmed that prosecutorial discretion is a necessary part of a properly functioning criminal justice system [citations omitted]. In ***Miazga v. Kvello Estate***, 2009 SCC 51, [2009] 3 S.C.R. 339, at para. 47, the fundamental importance of prosecutorial discretion was said to lie, 

        > not in protecting the interests of individual Crown attorneys, but in advancing the public interest by enabling prosecutors to make discretionary decisions in fulfilment of their professional obligations without fear of judicial or political interference, thus fulfilling their quasijudicial role as ‘ministers of justice.’” 
        
        More recently, in ***Sriskandarajah v. United States of America***, 2012 SCC 70, [2012] 3 S.C.R. 609, at para. 27, this Court observed that “[n]ot only does prosecutorial discretion accord with the principles of fundamental justice, it constitutes an indispensable device for the effective enforcement of the criminal law.”
    - [39] In ***R. v. Krieger***, [2006 SCC 47](https://canlii.ca/t/1ptwc){:target=" \_blank"}, this Court provided the following description of prosecutorial discretion:
    
        > "Prosecutorial discretion” is a term of art. It does not simply refer to any discretionary decision made by a Crown prosecutor. Prosecutorial discretion refers to the use of those powers that constitute the core of the Attorney General’s office and which are protected from the influence of improper political and other vitiating factors by the principle of independence. [para. 43]
    - [40] The Court went on to provide the following examples of prosecutorial discretion: whether to bring the prosecution of a charge laid by police; whether to enter a stay of proceedings in either a private or public prosecution; whether to accept a guilty plea to a lesser charge; whether to withdraw from criminal proceedings altogether; and whether to take control of a private prosecution (para. 46). The Court continued:

        > ... Put differently, prosecutorial discretion refers to decisions regarding the nature and extent of the prosecution and the Attorney General’s participation in it. 
    - [45] In sum, prosecutorial discretion applies to a wide range of prosecutorial decision making. That said, care must be taken to distinguish matters of prosecutorial discretion from constitutional obligations. **The distinction between prosecutorial discretion and the constitutional obligations of the Crown was made** in ***Krieger***, where the prosecutor’s duty to disclose relevant evidence to the accused was at issue:

        > In ***Stinchcombe*** [[1991] 3 SCR 326], the Court held that the Crown has an obligation to disclose all relevant information to the defence. While the Crown Attorney retains the discretion not to disclose irrelevant information, disclosure of relevant evidence is not, therefore, a matter of prosecutorial discretion but, rather, is a prosecutorial duty. [Emphasis added; para. 54.]

        Manifestly, **the Crown possesses no discretion to breach the Charter rights of an accused**. In other words, prosecutorial discretion provides no shield to a Crown prosecutor who has failed to fulfill his or her constitutional obligations such as the duty to provide proper disclosure to the defence.
    - **(i) The Standard of Review for Prosecutorial Discretion**
    - [46] The many decisions that Crown prosecutors are called upon to make in the exercise of their prosecutorial discretion must not be subjected to routine second-guessing by the courts. **Judicial non-interference** with prosecutorial discretion has been referred to as a “matter of principle based on the doctrine of **separation of powers** as well as a matter of policy founded on the **efficiency of the system of criminal justice**” which also recognizes that prosecutorial discretion is “especially ill-suited to judicial review”.
    - [47] The Court also noted the more **practical problems** associated with regular review of prosecutorial discretion:

        > The quasi-judicial function of the Attorney General cannot be subjected to interference from parties who are not as competent to consider the various factors involved in making a decision to prosecute. To subject such decisions to political interference, or to judicial supervision, could erode the integrity of our system of prosecution. [para. 32]
    - [48] Manifestly, prosecutorial discretion is entitled to considerable deference. **It is not, however, immune from all judicial oversight.** This Court has repeatedly affirmed that prosecutorial discretion is reviewable for abuse of process: ***Krieger***, at para. 32; ***Nixon***, at para. 31; ***Miazga***, at para. 46. 
    - [50] Regardless of the precise language used, the key point is this: abuse of process refers to Crown conduct that is **egregious and seriously compromises trial fairness and/or the integrity of the justice system**. Crown decisions motivated by prejudice against Aboriginal persons would certainly meet this standard. 
    - **(ii) The Threshold Evidentiary Burden** 
    - [52] The **burden of proof** for establishing abuse of process lies on the **claimant**, who must prove it on **a balance of probabilities**. However, given the unique nature of prosecutorial discretion, specifically, the fact that the Crown will typically (if not always) be the only party who will know why a particular decision was made, this Court in ***Nixon*** recognized that **where prosecutorial discretion is challenged, the Crown may be required to provide reasons justifying its decision** where the claimant establishes a proper evidentiary foundation: para. 60.

**Code of Professional Conduct**

All lawyers are subject to rules of professional conduct and ethics, including both Crown Prosecutors and Defence Counsel, as a requirement of their membership in their provincial or territorial law society in Canada.

In British Columbia, the *Code of Professional Conduct for British Columbia* (the “***BC Code***”) applies to all lawyers and is available online at the following [link](https://www.lawsociety.bc.ca/support-and-resources-for-lawyers/act-rules-and-code/code-of-professional-conduct-for-british-columbia){:target=" \_blank"}.

## Discussion Activity: Crown Prosecutors and the BC Code

Identify one provision in the BC Code that is particularly relevant for the role of a Crown Prosecutor and post it in the Unit 2 Discussion Forum. If other students have already identified the provisions that you have found, please comment on one of them instead. You could also ask a question for fellow students or for the Course Instructor, to answer about the role of a Crown Prosecutor or ethical dilemmas that they may face in practice.

!!! quote "Answer"

    I noticed Rule 2.1-1(b) is of special importance in relation to this section’s topic. It provides that: “When engaged as a Crown prosecutor, a lawyer’s primary duty is not to seek a conviction but to see that justice is done; to that end the lawyer should make timely disclosure to the defence of all facts and known witnesses whether tending to show guilt or innocence, or that would affect the punishment of the accused.” This provision can be crunched into two core parts.

    First, it clarifies the orientation of the prosecutor’s role: the Crown is not a partisan actor whose objective is to secure convictions, but a minister of justice whose responsibility is to ensure that the process is fair and that outcomes are just. The legitimacy of the criminal justice system depends on this distinction, because the Crown’s power is balanced by its obligation to act with fairness and restraint.

    Second, the rule sets out the prosecutor’s most important operational duty — disclosure. The Crown must make timely disclosure of all relevant facts and witnesses, not only those that advance the prosecution’s case, but also those that tend to show innocence or that may affect punishment. This obligation ensures that the accused can make full answer and defence and that the trial is not distorted by selective presentation of evidence.

    This ethical framework is consistent with the Supreme Court of Canada’s approach in ***Boucher v. The Queen***, 1954 CanLII 3 (SCC), where the Court emphasized that the Crown’s role is not to obtain a conviction at all costs, but to present the case firmly and fairly as a minister of justice.

**Disclosure**

One of the duties of a Crown Prosecutor is to ensure full and timely disclosure of all potentially relevant information to the Accused, subject to certain limited exceptions (usually involving “**privilege**”). In a typical criminal case, a “**disclosure package**” would include such things as:

- the complete police report
- photographs and videos
- copies of any warrants
- fingerprint analysis reports
- witness statements and notes
- transcribed confessions
- lists of items (“exhibits”) seized
- expert reports

The duty to provide disclosure is now a constitutional requirement, as set out by ***R. v. Stinchcombe***, [1991 CanLII 45 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fsgp){:target=" \_blank"}. From the case headnote (emphasis added in bold):

> The Crown has a legal duty to disclose **all relevant information** to the defence. The fruits of the investigation which are in its possession are not the property of the Crown for use in securing a conviction but **the property of the public to be used to ensure that justice is done**.  The obligation to disclose is subject to a discretion with respect to the withholding of information and to the timing and manner of disclosure.  **Crown counsel has a duty to respect the rules of privilege and to protect the identity of informers.**  A discretion must also be exercised with respect to the relevance of information.  **The Crown's discretion is reviewable** by the trial judge, who should be guided by the general principle that information should not be withheld if there is a reasonable possibility that this will impair the right of the accused to **make full answer and defence**.  The absolute withholding of information which is relevant to the defence can only be justified on the basis of the existence of a legal privilege which excludes the information from disclosure.  **This privilege is reviewable**, however, on the ground that it is not a reasonable limit on the right to make full answer and defence in a particular case.

> **Initial disclosure should occur before the accused is called upon to elect the mode of trial or plead.**  Subject to the Crown's discretion, **all relevant information must be disclosed**, both that which the Crown intends to introduce into evidence and that which it does not, and **whether the evidence is inculpatory or exculpatory.**  All statements obtained from persons who have provided relevant information to the authorities should be produced, even if they are not proposed as Crown witnesses.  

!!! info "*Stinchcombe*"

    - I would add that the fruits of the investigation which are in the possession of counsel for the Crown are not the property of the Crown for use in securing a conviction but the property of the public to be used to ensure that justice is done.
    - ... there is the overriding concern that failure to disclose impedes the ability of the accused to **make full answer and defence**. This common law right has acquired new vigour by virtue of its inclusion in s. 7 of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* as one of the principles of fundamental justice. ... The right to make full answer and defence is one of the pillars of criminal justice on which we heavily depend to ensure that the innocent are not convicted.
    - With respect to what should be disclosed, the general principle to which I have referred is that **all relevant information must be disclosed subject to the reviewable discretion of the Crown**. The material must include not only that which the Crown intends to introduce into evidence but also that which it does not. No distinction should be made between inculpatory and exculpatory evidence. 
    - This obligation to disclose is **not absolute**. It is subject to the **discretion of counsel for the Crown**. This discretion extends both to the withholding of information and to the timing of disclosure. 

**Wrongful Convictions**

The most serious consequence of a Crown Prosecutor not following their duties and responsibilities is that they may contribute to wrongful convictions.

## Discussion Activity: Wrongful Convictions

After you watch “The Wrong Man”, please post a comment or question in the Discussion Forum for Unit 2 about how Crown Prosecutors may contribute to wrongful convictions, and how they can prevent them.

the following [article](https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/manitoba/george-dangerfield-blaming-wrong-man-murder-1.4682564){:target=" \_blank"} outlines the issues at play in the case.

!!! quote "Answer"

    By withholding crucial evidence, entering into undisclosed bargains with jailhouse informants, relying on questionable testimony, or using coerced confessions, a Crown prosecutor can mislead both the jury and the court and thereby contribute to a wrongful conviction.

    The objective reason this can occur is that Crown prosecutors enjoy a high degree of prosecutorial discretion, which is reviewable by the courts only on the narrow ground of abuse of process.

    As explained in ***R v Krieger***, 2006 SCC 47, “prosecutorial discretion” does not simply refer to any discretionary decision made by a Crown prosecutor. Rather, it refers to the exercise of powers that lie at the core of the Attorney General’s role and that are protected from improper political and other vitiating influences by the principle of independence. As the Court later affirmed in ***R v Anderson***, 2014 SCC 41, such discretion is entitled to considerable deference. It is not, however, completely immune from judicial review.

    The subjective reason in this case is that the prosecutor, **George Dangerfield**, disregarded the proper purpose of a criminal prosecution, which is not to obtain a conviction, but to see that justice is done for both the accused and the victims. He may have prioritized winning the case over fairness, thereby pursuing a conviction at the expense of the accused’s rights and the integrity of the process.

    There are several ways to prevent prosecutorial abuse of process. One of the most important and effective is full and timely disclosure of all potentially relevant information to the accused.

    The duty of disclosure is a constitutional requirement, as established in ***R v Stinchcombe***, 1991 CanLII 45 (SCC). The Crown has a legal obligation to disclose all relevant information to the defence. The fruits of the investigation in the Crown’s possession are not the property of the Crown to be used to secure a conviction, but the property of the public, to be used to ensure that justice is done. With respect to the scope of disclosure, the governing principle is that all relevant information must be disclosed, subject to the Crown’s reviewable discretion. This includes not only material the Crown intends to adduce in evidence, but also material it does not. No distinction is to be drawn between inculpatory and exculpatory evidence.
    
## 2.4 Defence Counsel

While the role of Defence Counsel is to represent the accused, this does not mean that their obligations are limited to their client. Rather, Defence Counsel also have obligations as “officers of the court”. At times, these duties to the client and the court may create **ethical dilemmas**. 

**The Defence Counsel’s Role & Duties**

These readings introduce the role and responsibilities of Defence Counsel. As you read them, consider what **limitations** apply in defending a client in a criminal case and how this role is different from the role of the Crown Prosecutor. They also introduce some **challenging situations** that Defence Counsel may find themselves in and provide the view of judges and experienced lawyers on how to address them.

#### <p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">Textbook Summary: pages 293-298</p>

The *Federation of Law Societies of Canada*’s [Model Code of Professional Conduct (2017)](https://flsc.ca/what-we-do/model-code-of-professional-conduct/interactive-model-code-of-professional-conduct/){:target=" \_blank"}, provides as follows:

> 5.1-1 When acting as an advocate, a lawyer must represent the client resolutely and honourably within the limits of the law, while treating the tribunal with candour, fairness, courtesy and respect.

> [9] Duty as Defence Counsel—When defending an accused person, a lawyer’s duty is to protect the client as far as possible **from being convicted**, except by a tribunal of competent jurisdiction and upon legal evidence sufficient to support a conviction for the offence with which the client is charged. Accordingly, and **notwithstanding the lawyer’s private opinion on credibility or the merits**, a lawyer may properly rely on any evidence or defences, including so-called technicalities, not known to be false or fraudulent. 

> 5.1-2A A lawyer must not counsel or participate in the concealment, destruction or alteration of incriminating physical evidence or otherwise act so as to obstruct or attempt to obstruct the course of justice.

> [3] A lawyer is never required to take or keep possession of incriminating physical evidence or to disclose its mere existence. Possession of illegal things could constitute an offense. **A lawyer in possession of incriminating physical evidence** should carefully consider his or her options. These options include, as soon as reasonably possible:

> - (a) delivering the evidence to law enforcement authorities or the prosecution, either directly or anonymously; 
> - (b) delivering the evidence to the tribunal in the relevant proceeding, which may also include seeking the direction of the tribunal to facilitate access by the prosecution or defence for testing or examination; or 
> - (c) disclosing the existence of the evidence to the prosecution and, if necessary, preparing to argue before a tribunal the appropriate uses, disposition or admissibility of it. 

> [5] A lawyer has no obligation to assist the authorities in gathering physical evidence of crime but cannot act or advise anyone to hinder an investigation or a prosecution. **The lawyer’s advice to a client that the client has the right to refuse to divulge the location of physical evidence does not constitute hindering an investigation.** A lawyer who becomes aware of the existence of incriminating physical evidence or declines to take possession of it must not counsel or participate in its concealment, destruction or alteration.

**Solicitor and client privilege** will be studied in your evidence course. Although privilege is zealously protected, a number of **exceptions** have been recognized, including 

- (1) when it must be revealed as the only means to demonstrate the innocence of the accused, 
- (2) when the communications themselves are criminal in nature, and 
- (3) for public safety reasons relating to a clear and serious risk of serious harm to an identifiable person or group of people. 

See ***Smith v. Jones***, [1999 CanLII 674 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fqp9){:target=" \_blank"}; ***R. v. McClure***, [2001 SCC 14](https://canlii.ca/t/5228){:target=" \_blank"}. 

**David Layton** and **Michel Proulx** in *Ethics and Canadian Criminal Law*, 2nd ed (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2015) at 43-44 (footnotes omitted) deal with the case of ***Colpitts*** as follows:

> Counsel’s knowledge concerning the guilt of the client frequently comes from confidential information, most often in the form of a client confession. In such a case, counsel is bound by the duty of confidentiality owed to the client and is prohibited from sharing the information with anyone. 
> 
> It is equally unacceptable to reveal a client’s incriminating confidences by way of suggestive comment or to make statements that imply impropriety on the part of the client. 

The authors go on to make recommendations about how lawyers should react to both **anticipated and completed client perjury**. They recommend that counsel should first attempt to convince the client not to engage in perjury and inform the client of the serious adverse consequences that can flow from perjury including the lawyer’s remedies, which in their view may include withdrawal of the lawyer from the case and even disclosure by the lawyer if the client actually commits perjury and does not retract the false testimony. 

They conclude at 370-71 (footnotes omitted):

> There is good reason to deny a client the benefits of the duties of loyalty and confidentiality where he has abused the solicitor-client relationship in an effort to pervert the course of justice. In our opinion, disclosure is therefore justified from a policy point of view where perjury has occurred and where the client refuses to correct the falsehood. 
> 
> Yet the majority of Canadian ethical codes appear to preclude counsel from disclosing acompleted client perjury to the court. ... [T]he confidentiality rules adopted by most governing bodies contain no exception that would allow disclosure for the purpose of remedying a client’s perjury. In particular, **these rules permit disclosure to prevent future harm but only where the harm involves death or serious bodily injury**, a precondition that will almost never be met in the client-perjury scenario. 
> 
> See for example 3.3-1 of the *Federation of Law Societies*’ **Model Code of Professional Conduct**, which provides:
> 
> A lawyer at all times must hold in strict confidence all information concerning the business and affairs of a client acquired in the course of the professional relationship and must not divulge any such information **unless**: 
> 
> - (a) expressly or impliedly **authorized** by the client;
> - (b) **required** by law or a court to do so; 
> - (c) **required** to deliver the information to the Law Society; or 
> - (d) otherwise **permitted** by this rule.

## Code of Professional Conduct

As noted in the last topic, all lawyers are subject to the rules of professional conduct and ethics, including both **Crown Prosecutors** and **Defence Counsel**, as a requirement of their membership in their provincial or territorial law society in Canada.

As noted in the previous topic, in British Columbia, the [*Code of Professional Conduct for British Columbia* (the “***BC Code***”)](https://www.lawsociety.bc.ca/for-lawyers/act-rules-and-code/code-of-professional-conduct/){:target=" \_blank"} applies to all lawyers, including Defence Counsel.

## Discussion Activity: Defence Counsel and the BC Code

Identify one provision in the BC Code that is particularly relevant to the role of Defence Counsel and post it in the Unit 2 Discussion Forum. If other students have already identified the provision you found, please comment on one of your classmate’s entries instead. Some questions that you could consider in identifying a relevant provision include the following:

- When are you permitted as Defence Counsel to disclose confidential information from your client?
- What are the steps that you should take if your client says he intends to lie on the stand?
- Are you permitted to give your client money to get out on bail?
- When can a lawyer represent an Accused on a guilty plea?
- What are the limits placed on your defence strategy if your client admits the factual elements of the offence?

!!! quote "Answer"

    I found an interesting provision regarding the handling of incriminating evidence in both the ***Model Code*** and the b. What struck me most is that, although the core rule is the same, the commentary on the options available to defence lawyers is slightly different.

    In ***Model Code*** 5.1-2A, it provides:

    > “A lawyer must not counsel or participate in the concealment, destruction or alteration of incriminating physical evidence or otherwise act so as to obstruct or attempt to obstruct the course of justice.”

    In the commentary that follows, provision (3) states:

    > [3] A lawyer is never required to take or keep possession of incriminating physical evidence or to disclose its mere existence. Possession of illegal things could constitute an offense. A lawyer in possession of incriminating physical evidence should carefully consider his or her options. These options include, as soon as reasonably possible:

    > - (a) delivering the evidence to law enforcement authorities or the prosecution, either directly or anonymously;
    > - (b) delivering the evidence to the tribunal in the relevant proceeding, which may also include seeking the direction of the tribunal to facilitate access by the prosecution or defence for testing or examination; or
    > - (c) disclosing the existence of the evidence to the prosecution and, if necessary, preparing to argue before a tribunal the appropriate uses, disposition or admissibility of it.

    A similar provision in the ***BC Code*** treats incriminating evidence slightly differently. Section 5.1-2.1 of the ***BC Code*** uses the same wording:

    > A lawyer must not counsel or participate in the concealment, destruction or alteration of incriminating physical evidence so as to obstruct or attempt to obstruct the course of justice,

    but the accompanying commentary adds a fourth option beyond the three suggested in the ***Model Code***:

    > [3.1] Unless a lawyer’s handling of incriminating physical evidence is otherwise prescribed by law, the options available to a lawyer who has taken possession of such evidence include, as soon as reasonably possible:
    
    > - (a) delivering the evidence to law enforcement authorities or the prosecution, either directly or anonymously;
    > - (b) delivering the evidence to the tribunal in the relevant proceeding, which may also include seeking the direction of the tribunal to facilitate access by the prosecution or defence for testing or examination;
    > - (c) disclosing the existence of the evidence to the prosecution and, if necessary, preparing to argue before a tribunal the appropriate uses, disposition or admissibility of it; or
    > - (d) returning the evidence to its source, provided doing so will not cause the evidence to be concealed, destroyed or altered.

    I think this additional option strikes a balance between preserving solicitor-client privilege and upholding the integrity of the justice process. A further benefit is that clients may place greater trust in their lawyers and be more truthful when disclosing case facts, knowing that seeking legal advice does not automatically require surrendering every piece of physical evidence to the state.

!!! danger "Samantha's Comment"

    When you are looking at the Code, and the readings for this section, also turn your minds to the overall role of Defence counsel.  What is their purpose and value in the overall system? 

## 2.5 Classification of Offences

**Types of Offences**

All offences in the *Criminal Code* are classified by Parliament when they are enacted by legislation. The words that create the offence itself, or the penalty provision appearing after it, will identify the offence as “**summary**” or “**indictable**” (pronounced “in-dite-a-ble”), or indicate that it can be either summary or indictable, meaning it is a “**hybrid**” offence.

**Summary Conviction Offences**

These offences are less serious criminal offences and follow a simplified or “summary” procedure. In court, the Crown Prosecutor might say that they are “proceeding summarily” to indicate that the Accused has been charged with a summary conviction offence. In American TV shows you hear these types of offences being referred to as “**misdemeanors**”.

The trial of a summary conviction offence will be held in B.C. **Provincial Court**.  The trial takes place **without a jury** and there is no preliminary inquiry – Part XXVII of the *Criminal Code* sets out the **simplified procedure** to be followed. The **maximum penalty** for this type of offence is **2 years (less a day)** in jail and/or a **$5000 fine**, unless the offence prescribes a different penalty (see Criminal Code s. 787.) 

The following is an example of a summary conviction offence from the *Criminal Code*.

> ***Punishment for unlawful assembly***

> 66 (1) Every one who is a member of an unlawful assembly is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.

**Indictable Offences**

These offences are generally more serious and equate to “**felonies**” on American TV.  **Only the federal Parliament, and not the provinces, can create indictable offences.**  They are found in the *Criminal Code* and in other federal statutes.  The maximum penalty will vary with the offence, as does the mode of trial. 

In B.C. Provincial Court **the “charging document” (the sworn document setting out the charges) is called an “Information”**. If an Accused is charged with an indictable offence in provincial court, the Information is noted at the top with the words “**BY INDICTMENT**”. **If these words are not typed at the top of the page, it can be assumed that Crown is proceeding summarily.** 

Indictable matters can also be heard in B.C. Supreme Court. The charging document in this court is called an “**Indictment**”, likely because only indictable matters can be heard at this level of court.

The following is an example of an indictable offence from the *Criminal Code*.

> ***Breach of trust by public officer***

> 122 Every official who, in connection with the duties of his office, commits fraud or a breach of trust is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding five years.

**Hybrid Offences**

For certain offences, the Crown may “elect” (decide) to proceed either summarily or by indictment – these are known as “hybrid” offences. 

When an Accused is charged with a hybrid offence, it is **deemed to be indictable, unless and until the Crown elects to proceed by summary conviction**: *Interpretation Act*, s. 34(1)(a). (Adapted from: Janine Benedet, Casebook: 2007-2008, Ch. 1.)

The following is an example of a hybrid offence from the *Criminal Code*.

> ***False statement in relation to passport***

> (2) Every one who, while in or out of Canada, for the purpose of procuring a passport for himself or any other person or for the purpose of procuring any material alteration or addition to any such passport, makes a written or an oral statement that he knows is false or misleading

> - (a) is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding two years; or
> - (b) is guilty of an offence punishable on summary conviction.
