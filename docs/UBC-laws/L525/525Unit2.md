## 2.1 The Onus & Standard of Proof

**Onus of Proof (a.k.a. Burden of Proof)**

The onus of proof (sometimes called the burden of proof) refers to who has the **obligation to prove an issue in a criminal trial**. The onus of proof will fall on either the Crown or the Defence for each disputed issue that arises during a trial. **The main onus of proof in criminal matters is the Crown’s onus** to prove the offence charged and to establish the Accused’s guilt. 

Some onuses fall on the Defence. For example, if an Accused asserts a defence such as necessity, duress or self-defence, it is they who have the onus of proving its applicability.

There are also situations where an onus of proof can shift back and forth between the Crown and an Accused. 

**Standard of Proof**

The standard of proof refers to **how much evidence the Crown or Defence must present in order to prove an issue** in a criminal trial. The **highest** standard of proof in Canadian criminal law is **proof beyond a reasonable doubt**. This is the overarching standard to which Crown must prove the offence charged and the Accused’s guilt.

Lesser standards of proof may also apply in criminal proceedings. These can include “reasonable grounds”, “reasonable and probable grounds”, “some credible evidence” or “a balance of probabilities”. These lesser standards require that less evidence be put before the court and are therefore easier for the party with the onus of proof to meet.

**Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt**

The decision in ***R. v. Lifchus***, [1997 CanLII 319 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fqzt){:target=" \_blank"} is a leading case setting out the meaning of “proof beyond a reasonable doubt”. As you read the case, consider how Justice Cory defines the concept by what it does not mean, and then by what it does mean. Then read the subsequent case of ***R. v. Starr***, [2000 SCC 40](https://canlii.ca/t/525l){:target=" \_blank"} to see how the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada has been strict in requiring compliance with the ***Lifchus*** description of “proof beyond a reasonable doubt”.

    - 36 Perhaps a brief summary of what the definition should and should not contain may be helpful. **It should be explained that:**
        - the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt is inextricably **intertwined** with that principle fundamental to all criminal trials, the presumption of innocence;
        - the burden of proof rests on the **prosecution** throughout the trial and never shifts to the accused;
        - a reasonable doubt is **not a doubt based upon sympathy or prejudice**;
        - rather, it is based upon **reason and common sense**;
        - it is logically connected to the **evidence or absence of evidence**;
        - it does not involve proof to an **absolute certainty**; it is not proof beyond any doubt nor is it an imaginary or frivolous doubt; and
        - more is required than proof that the accused is probably guilty - a jury which concludes only that the accused is **probably guilty must acquit**.
    - 37 On the other hand, certain references to the required standard of proof should be **avoided**. For example:
        - describing the term “reasonable doubt” as an ordinary expression which has no special meaning in the criminal law context;
        - inviting jurors to apply to the task before them the same standard of proof that they apply to important, or even the most important, decisions in their own lives;
        - equating proof “beyond a reasonable doubt” to proof “to a moral certainty”;
        - qualifying the word “doubt” with adjectives other than “reasonable”, such as “serious”,  “substantial” or “haunting”, which may mislead the jury; and
        - instructing jurors that they may convict if they are “sure” that the accused is guilty, before providing them with a proper definition as to the meaning of the words “beyond a reasonable doubt”.

!!! info "Starr"

    - 82 In ***Lifchus***, at para. 22, this Court held that the expression “beyond a reasonable doubt” must be explained to a jury.  In four different manners, Cory J. articulated guidelines for how trial judges should go about explaining this concept to a jury.  
        - First, he discussed what should be avoided (at paras. 23-26).  
        - Second, Cory J. explained what should be included in the definition of reasonable doubt (at paras. 27-35).  
        - Third, Cory J. provided a summary of what the definition “should and should not contain” (at paras. 36 and 37).  
        - Finally, Cory J. offered a suggested charge for trial judges to use in explaining the concept of reasonable doubt to a jury (at para. 39).
    - 83 **Several matters are noteworthy about Cory J.’s reasons** in ***Lifchus*** as set out above.  
        - First, in grappling with the issue of whether reasonable doubt must be explained to a jury, Cory J. acknowledged the confusing nature of this term and implicitly recognized the challenge facing trial judges in articulating it to a jury.  
        - 84 Second, I believe it is notable that in articulating how the expression “reasonable doubt” should be explained to the jury, Cory J. generally employed the words “should” and “should not” rather than the imperative “must” and “must not”.  I cannot believe that Cory J. intended to use “should” and “must” interchangeably so as to make his list of items that “should be avoided” equivalent to a list of items that are prohibited and the inclusion of which automatically constitutes reversible error.  I find support for this position in Cory J.’s statement that the equation of the term “moral certainty” with “reasonable doubt” in a trial judge’s charge to the jury “although not necessarily fatal to a charge on reasonable doubt, should be avoided” (para. 25 (emphasis added)).
        - Third, Cory J. stated expressly that “[a]ny form of instruction that complied with the applicable principles and avoided the pitfalls referred to would be satisfactory” (para. 40).  He did not view his suggested charge as a “magic incantation that needs to be repeated word for word” (para. 40).
        - 86 Fourth, and most importantly, Cory J. expressly stated that “an **error** in the instructions as to the standard of proof may not constitute a reversible error” (para.  41).  He reiterated this Court’s statement in ***R. v. W. (D.)***, 1991 CanLII 93 (SCC), [1991] 1 S.C.R. 742, at p. 758, that the verdict ought not be disturbed “if the charge, when read as a whole, makes it clear that the jury could not have been under any misapprehension as to the correct burden and standard of proof to apply”.  Cory J. explained that “[o]n the other hand, if the charge as a whole gives rise to the reasonable likelihood that the jury misapprehended the standard of proof, then **as a general rule the verdict will have to be set aside and a new trial directed**” (para. 41).
    - 87 **Two further annotations** to ***Lifchus*** are necessary.  ***Lifchus***, at para. 27,  emphasized the need for the trial judge to link the standard of proof beyond a reasonable doubt to
  
        > that basic premise which is fundamental to all criminal trials: the presumption of innocence.  T**he two concepts are forever as closely linked** as Romeo with Juliet or Oberon with Titania and they must be presented together as a unit . . . Jurors must be reminded that the **burden** of proving beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused committed the crime **rests with the prosecution throughout the trial and never shifts to the accused**. 

        In addition, Cory J. stated that jurors “must be advised that the Crown is **not required to prove its case to an absolute certainty** since such an unrealistically high standard could seldom be achieved” (para. 31).

**Presumption of Innocence at Common Law**

The presumption of innocence is one of the most fundamental protections afforded to accused persons in our system of criminal law. It puts the onus on the Crown to prove the guilt of individuals that it seeks to punish, rather than the other way around.
