# L525 Midterm Notes

## 1.2 Sources of Law

The three major sources of criminal law are:

- **Constitutional Law:** comprised of the *Constitution Act*, 1867 and *Constitution Act*, 1982 (including the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*)
- **Statutory Law:** also referred to as legislation, which is enacted by the federal Parliament (e.g. *Criminal Code*) or provincial legislatures, acting within their respective areas of jurisdiction
    - [***Criminal Code***](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46){:target=" \_blank"}, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46: Canada’s primary criminal law statute. 
    - [***Controlled Drugs and Substances Act***](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-38.8){:target=" \_blank"}, S.C. 1996, c. 19: Canada’s specialized statute dealing with illicit drugs.
    - [***Youth Criminal Justice Act***](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/Y-1.5){:target=" \_blank"}, S.C. 2002, c. 1: Canada’s criminal law statute governing persons who allegedly committed an offence(s) while under the age of eighteen years.
- **Common Law:** judicial decisions by various levels of courts, which is also referred to as “judge-made law”, “case law” or jurisprudence


!!! info "Alan W Mewett, “*The Criminal Law, 1867-1967*”"

    - One significant change was that enacted by **section 8 [now s 9]** stating:
    
        > Notwithstanding anything in this Act or any other Act, no person shall be convicted or discharged under section 736

        > (a) of **an offence at common law**, 

    - On the other hand, **section 7(2) [now s 8(3)]** providing:

        > Every rule and principle of the common law that renders any circumstance a justification or excuse for an act or a **defence** to a charge continues in force and applies in respect of proceedings for an offence under this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, except insofar as they are altered by or are inconsistent with this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada.

## Discussion: Federal Gov't Options

What options does the federal government have if it disagrees with a judicial decision interpreting the Criminal Code? Are there any limitations to those options?

!!! quote "Answer"

    - First, the government may appeal the decision to a higher court, provided there is a right of appeal or leave is granted. 
    - Second, if the judicial interpretation is final or remains unsatisfactory after appeals are exhausted, the government may pursue a legislative response by introducing a bill to amend the Criminal Code.
    - However, the legislative route is neither simple nor guaranteed. Moreover, legislative amendments remain subject to constitutional limits. 

## 1.3 Criminal Offences and Defences

A criminal offence is comprised of two key elements: the ***actus reus*** or prohibited conduct, and the ***mens rea*** or mental fault. 

Before the **abolition of common law offences** by the 1953 *Criminal Code*, the Supreme Court of Canada in ***Frey v Fedoruk*** (a civil action for false imprisonment and malicious prosecution) had decided not to increase the number of common law offences and thus refused to declare it to be an offence to be a “peeping tom.”

Supreme Court of Canada found that criminal law defences may appear in **statute**, but may also continue to be recognized at **common law** by the courts.

Section 8(3) of the *Criminal Code* (“**Common law principles continued**”), was the provision interpreted in ***Amato v. The Queen***, [1982 CanLII 31 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1lpcs){:target=" \_blank"} as confirming the ongoing ability of the courts to recognize new defences at common law.

In some instances, the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*, specifically section 7 (principles of fundamental justice) has been interpreted to require that certain defences be available to accused persons. 

## 1.4 Interpreting the Criminal Code

The modern approach (also called the **purposive and contextual approach**) to statutory interpretation is how the *Criminal Code* is interpreted today. 

In ***Schreiber v. Canada (Attorney General)***, [2002 SCC 62](https://canlii.ca/t/51rl){:target=" \_blank"}. Justice LeBel explained the rule as follows:

> [56] A principle of **bilingual statutory interpretation** holds that where one version is ambiguous and the other is clear and unequivocal, **the common meaning of the two versions would a priori be preferred**; Furthermore, where one of the two versions is broader than the other, **the common meaning would favour the more restricted or limited meaning**.

The rule of **strict construction** of penal statutes: This rule holds that when interpreting a penal statute, including the *Criminal Code*, any **real textual ambiguities should be resolved in a way that benefits the accused**. 

As the Court explained in ***Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex***, [2002 SCC 42](https://canlii.ca/t/51s6){:target=" \_blank"}, one must **first apply this normal, “modern approach”** to statutory interpretation to determine whether an ambiguity truly exists.

> Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the **scheme** of the Act, the **object** of the Act, and the **intention** of Parliament.

“Other principles of interpretation, such as the **strict construction** of penal statutes and the ***Charter* values presumption**, only receive application where there is ambiguity as to the meaning of a provision” (at para 28). 

## 2.1 The Onus & Standard of Proof

**The main onus of proof in criminal matters is the Crown’s onus** to prove the offence charged and to establish the Accused’s guilt. 

The standard of proof refers to **how much evidence the Crown or Defence must present in order to prove an issue** in a criminal trial. The **highest** standard of proof in Canadian criminal law is proof **beyond a reasonable doubt**. This is the overarching standard to which Crown must prove the offence charged and the Accused’s guilt.

The decision in ***R. v. Lifchus***, [1997 CanLII 319 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fqzt){:target=" \_blank"} is a leading case setting out the meaning of “proof beyond a reasonable doubt”.

!!! info "*Lifchus*"

    - 30 It will suffice to instruct the jury that **a reasonable doubt is a doubt based on reason and common sense which must be logically based upon the evidence or lack of evidence**.
    - 31 They (jurors) should be instructed that a reasonable doubt **cannot be based on sympathy or prejudice**.  Further they should be told that a reasonable doubt **must not be imaginary or frivolous**.  As well they must be advised that the Crown is not required to prove its case to **an absolute certainty** since such an unrealistically high standard could seldom be achieved.
    - 32 They should be told that proof establishing **a probability of guilt is not sufficient** to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Section 11(d)** of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* enshrined the presumption of innocence in our constitutional law. It states:

> Any person charged with an offence has the right ... to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal.

## Discussion Activity: ***R. v. Keegstra***, [1990 CanLII 24 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fsr1){:target=" \_blank"}

Did section 319(2) violate Keegstra’s presumption of innocence, and if so, was that violation justified under s.1 of the *Charter*?


!!! quote "Answer"

    - One of the legal issues in ***Keegstra*** is whether sections 319(2) and 319(3)(a) of the *Criminal Code* violate the presumption of innocence principle in the common law and section 11(d) of the *Charter*, and thus reverse the burden of proof from the prosecution to the accused.
    - Both the majority and dissenting justices found that the provisions violate section 11(d) of the *Charter*, but they diverge in the second phase of the analysis. 
    - The majority held that the violation is justified under section 1, while the dissents argued that it could not be saved by section 1 because there lacks a “rational connection” between the aims of s. 319(3)(a) and its requirement that the accused prove the truth of his statements, and because the effects of the infringement and the objectives it promotes raise proportionality concerns.

In ***R. v. Downey***, [1992 CanLII 109 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fsbb){:target=" \_blank"}, **Cory J** provided the following summary of the principles that emerged from the s 11(d) jurisprudence to date:

1. The presumption of innocence is infringed whenever the accused is liable to be convicted despite the existence of a reasonable doubt.
2. If by the provisions of a statutory presumption, an accused is required to establish, that is to say to prove or disprove, on a balance of probabilities either an element of an offence or an excuse, then it contravenes s. 11(d). Such a provision would permit a conviction in spite of a reasonable doubt.
3. statutory presumptions which infringe s 11(d) may still be justified pursuant to s. 1 of the *Charter*. (As, for example, in ***Keegstra***, *supra*.)

The standard jury instructions in ***Lifchus***, often **supplemented by an explanation**, inspired by ***Starr***, that **proof beyond a reasonable doubt is closer to certainty than probability**. 


!!! info "*R. v. Starr*, [2000 SCC 40](https://canlii.ca/t/525l){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - It will be of great assistance for a jury if the trial judge situates the reasonable doubt standard appropriately between these two standards. I am in agreement with Twaddle J.A. in the court below, when he said, at p. 177:

        > If standards of proof were marked on a measure, proof “beyond reasonable doubt” would lie much closer to “absolute certainty” than to “a balance of probabilities.” 

## 2.2 Judges and Juries

Crown Counsel can charge an Accused either by **summary conviction** or by **indictment** (“in-dite-ment”). 

This independence is vital to fostering public confidence in the fairness and objectivity of the justice system. Three principles protect it:

- **Administrative independence:** Judges oversee the administration of the courts; the government does not set hearing dates or assign a judge to a particular case.
- **Financial security:** An independent body, the Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission, reviews judges’ salaries, benefits and retirement annuities, and recommends improvements and changes.
- **Security of tenure:** Judges can remain on the bench until retirement; they cannot be removed from office unless an independent investigation determines they are unfit or guilty of misconduct.

In addition to independence, judges are expected to maintain **integrity** and **impartiality**.

Section 11(f) of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* gives an Accused the right to a jury trial for serious offences as follows:

> 11 Any person charged with an offence has the right

> (f) except in the case of an offence under military law tried before a military tribunal, to the benefit of trial by jury where the maximum punishment for the offence is **imprisonment for five years or a more** severe punishment;

!!! info "***R. v. Gunning***, [2005 SCC 27](https://canlii.ca/t/1kt5b){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - ... but the **jury**, who must take its direction on the law from the judge, is the **sole arbiter on the facts**. The judge is also entitled to give an opinion on a question of fact and express it as strongly as the circumstances permit, so long as it is made clear to the jury that the opinion is given as **advice** and **not direction**.
    - 28 Subject to one exception, it is also the **exclusive domain of the jury to determine the verdict**. An exception lies where the judge is satisfied that there is no evidence upon which a properly instructed jury could reasonably convict, in which case, it is the judge’s duty to direct the jury to acquit the accused. **However, there is no corresponding duty or entitlement to direct a jury to return a verdict of guilty.** 
    - 29 As a corollary of the trial judge’s duty to instruct the jury on the law, it is a well-established principle that a judge should **withdraw a defence** from the consideration of the jury when there is no evidence upon which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could find in the accused’s favour. This threshold test, requiring that **a defence be put to the jury only if there is an evidential foundation for it**, is often referred to as the **“air of reality” test**.
    - 30 In every trial where there is no plea of guilty or an admission by the accused as to one or more of the essential elements of the offence, **the question of whether the Crown has met its burden is necessarily at play and must be put to the jury for its determination.** This “defence” is squarely before the jury. There is no further threshold to meet. 
    - 31 Hence, **it is never the function of the judge in a jury trial to assess the evidence and make a determination that the Crown has proven one or more of the essential elements of the offence and to direct the jury accordingly.**

## 2.3 Crown Prosecutors

**Both lawyers** representing the Crown (the Prosecutor) and the Accused (Defence Counsel) introduce evidence and make submissions on the facts an on the law.

A Crown Prosecutor’s role is not to secure convictions. His or her role is a public duty to **help the court arrive at a just result**.

***Boucher v. The Queen***, [1954 CanLII 3 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1nlk7){:target=" \_blank"} remains a leading Supreme Court of Canada decision on the role of the Crown Prosecutor:

> It cannot be over-emphasized that the purpose of a criminal prosecution is not to obtain a conviction, it is to lay before a jury what the Crown considers to be credible evidence relevant to what is alleged to be a crime. The role of prosecutor excludes any notion of winning or losing; his function is a matter of public duty than which in civil life there can be none charged with greater personal responsibility. It is to be efficiently performed with an ingrained sense of the dignity, the seriousness and the just­ness of judicial proceedings.

This case, ***R. v. Anderson***, [2014 SCC 41](https://canlii.ca/t/g784t){:target=" \_blank"}, provides an overview of “prosecutorial discretion”.

!!! info "*Anderson*"

    - ... **the prosecutor’s decision is a matter of prosecutorial discretion which is reviewable by the courts only for abuse of process**. 
    - [37] This Court has repeatedly affirmed that prosecutorial discretion is a necessary part of a properly functioning criminal justice system ... the fundamental importance of prosecutorial discretion was said to lie, 

        > not in protecting the interests of individual Crown attorneys, but in advancing the public interest by enabling prosecutors to make discretionary decisions in fulfilment of their professional obligations without fear of judicial or political interference, thus fulfilling their quasijudicial role as ‘ministers of justice.’” 
    - [45] In sum, prosecutorial discretion applies to a wide range of prosecutorial decision making. That said, care must be taken to distinguish matters of prosecutorial discretion from constitutional obligations. **The distinction between prosecutorial discretion and the constitutional obligations of the Crown was made** in ***Krieger***, where the prosecutor’s duty to disclose relevant evidence to the accused was at issue:

        > ... disclosure of relevant evidence is not, therefore, a matter of prosecutorial discretion but, rather, is a prosecutorial duty. 

        Manifestly, **the Crown possesses no discretion to breach the *Charter* rights of an accused**. In other words, prosecutorial discretion provides no shield to a Crown prosecutor who has failed to fulfill his or her constitutional obligations such as the duty to provide proper disclosure to the defence.
    - [46] The many decisions that Crown prosecutors are called upon to make in the exercise of their prosecutorial discretion must not be subjected to routine second-guessing by the courts. **Judicial non-interference** with prosecutorial discretion has been referred to as a “matter of principle based on the doctrine of **separation of powers** as well as a matter of policy founded on the **efficiency of the system of criminal justice**” which also recognizes that prosecutorial discretion is “especially ill-suited to judicial review”.
    - [48] Manifestly, prosecutorial discretion is entitled to considerable deference. **It is not, however, immune from all judicial oversight.** This Court has repeatedly affirmed that **prosecutorial discretion is reviewable for abuse of process**: ***Krieger***, at para. 32; ***Nixon***, at para. 31; ***Miazga***, at para. 46. 
    - **(ii) The Threshold Evidentiary Burden** 
    - [52] The **burden of proof** for establishing abuse of process lies on the **claimant**, who must prove it on **a balance of probabilities**. However, given the unique nature of prosecutorial discretion, specifically, the fact that the Crown will typically (if not always) be the only party who will know why a particular decision was made, this Court in ***Nixon*** recognized that **where prosecutorial discretion is challenged, the Crown may be required to provide reasons justifying its decision** where the claimant establishes a proper evidentiary foundation: para. 60.

## Discussion Activity: Crown Prosecutors and the *BC Code*


!!! quote "Answer"

    I noticed Rule 2.1-1(b) is of special importance in relation to this section’s topic. It provides that: “When engaged as a Crown prosecutor, a lawyer’s primary duty is not to seek a conviction but to see that justice is done; to that end the lawyer should make timely disclosure to the defence of all facts and known witnesses whether tending to show guilt or innocence, or that would affect the punishment of the accused.” This provision can be crunched into two core parts.

    First, it clarifies the orientation of the prosecutor’s role: the Crown is not a partisan actor whose objective is to secure convictions, but a minister of justice whose responsibility is to ensure that the process is fair and that outcomes are just. 

    Second, the rule sets out the prosecutor’s most important operational duty: disclosure. The Crown must make timely disclosure of all relevant facts and witnesses, not only those that advance the prosecution’s case, but also those that tend to show innocence or that may affect punishment. This obligation ensures that the accused can make full answer and defence and that the trial is not distorted by selective presentation of evidence.

    This ethical framework is consistent with the Supreme Court of Canada’s approach in ***Boucher v. The Queen***, 1954 CanLII 3 (SCC), where the Court emphasized that the Crown’s role is not to obtain a conviction at all costs, but to present the case firmly and fairly as a minister of justice.

One of the duties of a Crown Prosecutor is to ensure full and timely disclosure of all potentially relevant information to the Accused, subject to certain limited exceptions (usually involving “**privilege**”).

The duty to provide disclosure is now a constitutional requirement, as set out by ***R. v. Stinchcombe***, [1991 CanLII 45 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fsgp){:target=" \_blank"}.

> Subject to the Crown's discretion, **all relevant information must be disclosed**, both that which the Crown intends to introduce into evidence and that which it does not, and whether the evidence is **inculpatory** or **exculpatory**.

The most **serious consequence** of a Crown Prosecutor not following their duties and responsibilities is that they may contribute to **wrongful convictions**.

## Discussion Activity: Wrongful Convictions

!!! quote "Answer"

    By withholding crucial evidence, entering into undisclosed bargains with jailhouse informants, relying on questionable testimony, or using coerced confessions, a Crown prosecutor can mislead both the jury and the court and thereby contribute to a wrongful conviction.

    The objective reason this can occur is that Crown prosecutors enjoy a high degree of prosecutorial discretion, which is reviewable by the courts only on the narrow ground of abuse of process.

    The subjective reason in this case is that the prosecutor, **George Dangerfield**, disregarded the proper purpose of a criminal prosecution, which is not to obtain a conviction, but to see that justice is done for both the accused and the victims. 

    There are several ways to prevent prosecutorial abuse of process. One of the most important and effective is full and timely disclosure of all potentially relevant information to the accused.

## 2.4 Defence Counsel

Rather, Defence Counsel also have obligations as “**officers of the court**”.

All lawyers are subject to the rules of professional conduct and ethics, including both **Crown Prosecutors** and **Defence Counsel**.

The *Federation of Law Societies of Canada*’s [Model Code of Professional Conduct (2017)](https://flsc.ca/what-we-do/model-code-of-professional-conduct/interactive-model-code-of-professional-conduct/){:target=" \_blank"}, provides as follows:

> 5.1-1 When acting as an advocate, **a lawyer must represent the client resolutely and honourably within the limits of the law**, while treating the tribunal with candour, fairness, courtesy and respect.

> [9] Duty as Defence Counsel: When defending an accused person, a lawyer’s duty is to protect the client as far as possible **from being convicted**, except by a tribunal of competent jurisdiction and upon legal evidence sufficient to support a conviction for the offence with which the client is charged.

> [3] A lawyer is never required to take or keep possession of incriminating physical evidence or to disclose its mere existence. Possession of illegal things could constitute an offense. **A lawyer in possession of incriminating physical evidence** should carefully consider his or her options. These options include, as soon as reasonably possible:

> - (a) delivering the evidence to law enforcement authorities or the prosecution, either directly or anonymously; 
> - (b) delivering the evidence to the tribunal in the relevant proceeding, which may also include seeking the direction of the tribunal to facilitate access by the prosecution or defence for testing or examination; or 
> - (c) disclosing the existence of the evidence to the prosecution and, if necessary, preparing to argue before a tribunal the appropriate uses, disposition or admissibility of it. 

**Solicitor and client privilege** will be studied in your evidence course. Although privilege is zealously protected, a number of **exceptions** have been recognized, including 

- (1) when it must be revealed as the only means to demonstrate the innocence of the accused, 
- (2) when the communications themselves are criminal in nature, and 
- (3) for public safety reasons relating to a clear and serious risk of serious harm to an identifiable person or group of people. 

***Model Code:*** A lawyer at all times must hold in strict confidence all information concerning the business and affairs of a client acquired in the course of the professional relationship and must not divulge any such information **unless**: 

- (a) expressly or impliedly **authorized** by the client;
- (b) **required** by law or a court to do so; 
- (c) **required** to deliver the information to the Law Society; or 
- (d) otherwise **permitted** by this rule.

## 2.5 Classification of Offences

All offences in the *Criminal Code* are classified by Parliament when they are enacted by legislation. The words that create the offence itself, or the penalty provision appearing after it, will identify the offence as “**summary**” or “**indictable**” (pronounced “in-dite-a-ble”), or indicate that it can be either summary or indictable, meaning it is a “**hybrid**” offence.

The **maximum penalty** for this type of offence (summary conviction offence) is **2 years (less a day)** in jail and/or a **$5000 fine**, unless the offence prescribes a different penalty (see *Criminal Code* s. 787.) 

For certain offences, the Crown may “elect” (decide) to proceed either summarily or by indictment – these are known as “**hybrid**” offences. 

When an Accused is charged with a hybrid offence, it is **deemed to be indictable, unless and until the Crown elects to proceed by summary conviction**: *Interpretation Act*, s. 34(1)(a). (Adapted from: Janine Benedet, Casebook: 2007-2008, Ch. 1.)

## 2.6 Overview of Pre-trial and Trial Procedures

Criminal proceedings begin with a police investigation into criminal activity. In B.C., once an officer has gathered enough evidence to support a prosecution, he or she will **submit a police report to Crown Counsel**. This report is called a **Report to Crown Counsel** (“**RTCC**”) and includes typed narratives from each officer involved in the investigation explaining what they did, saw and learned during the investigation. The RTCC also includes a copy of all evidence gathered by police including photographs, videos, witness statements, fingerprint analysis and more.

Crown Counsel reviews the RTCC and **assesses the file for charge approval**. 

When assessing RTCCs for charge approval, the **Provincial Crown** apply a **two pronged standard**: 

- (1) there must be **enough evidence** to support a substantial likelihood of conviction, and 
- (2) it must be in the **public interest** to prosecute. 

The **Federal Crown** apply a slightly different **two pronged standard**: 

- (1) there must be enough evidence to support **a reasonable prospect** of conviction, and 
- (2) it must also be in the public interest to prosecute.

It is matter of **Crown discretion** whether to lay charges against an individual, who will thereafter be referred to as the “Accused”.

In Canada, **very few criminal charges proceed to trial**. In most cases, the Accused will either admit their guilt (“**plead guilty**”) and proceed to sentencing without a trial (often involving a **plea agreement** with the Crown Prosecutor that the judge must ultimately approve or depart from), or the Crown Prosecutor “stays” (**drops**) the charges due to there no longer being a substantial likelihood of conviction or because it is no longer in the public interest to prosecute.

If an Accused denies the charges (“**pleads not guilty**”) then a trial will ensue.

***Pre-Trial***

**Arraignment**: Formal reading of the charge to the Accused and entering of a plea. If the plea is “Guilty,” the Accused proceeds to sentencing.  If s/he pleads “Not Guilty” then a **trial** or **Preliminary Hearing** (This is similar to a trial but there is a lesser evidentiary threshold) is scheduled. 

## 3.1 Introduction

At common law, and now under section 7 of the *Charter*, every criminal offence must include **prohibited conduct** (*actus reus*) accompanied by the **requisite mental state** (*mens rea*).

The concept of *actus reus* refers to more than simply a prohibited action; *actus reus* comprises a bundle of components that, together, constitute the “guilty act.” Put most helpfully, the *actus reus* requires a 

- **Physical voluntariness** – that the Accused did the prohibited physical action on purpose (this is discussed more in the next topic)
- **Act or omission** – what the Accused physically did (or didn’t do in the case of an omission)
- Sometimes in **prescribed circumstances** – for instance, if someone is charged with “assaulting a police officer”, the prescribed circumstance is that the assaulted person must have been a police officer.
- Sometimes causing **certain consequences** – for example, if someone is charged with “assault causing bodily harm”, the required consequence of the prohibited act (the assault) is that the assaulted person was harmed.

## 3.2 Voluntariness

The first of the elements of the *actus reus* is the requirement for voluntary conduct. The essential characteristic of voluntariness is the **conscious control of action**. Consciousness alone, however, is not enough to establish voluntariness because a person might be conscious and yet still be incapable of controlling his or her conduct. In sum, **the voluntariness of a person’s conduct will be established if his or her conduct is the product of conscious choice.** 

The Supreme Court of Canada decision in ***Ruzic*** confirms that both at common law and under section 7 of the *Charter*, **there can be no criminal liability unless the conduct was voluntary**. The test for physical voluntariness set out by the Court is that it requires a “**conscious mind and a controlled body**” – if either of these is lacking, there is no physical voluntariness, and no crime has occurred. 

## 3.3 Acts & Omissions

Most criminal offences require that an Accused commit a **positive act**. Certain offences can be committed by **failing to act** (e.g. **omissions**). These involve situations where the Accused was **under a legal duty** to act and failed to do so.
