# L525 Midterm Notes

## 1.2 Sources of Law

The three major sources of criminal law are:

- **Constitutional Law:** comprised of the *Constitution Act*, 1867 and *Constitution Act*, 1982 (including the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*)
- **Statutory Law:** also referred to as legislation, which is enacted by the federal Parliament (e.g. *Criminal Code*) or provincial legislatures, acting within their respective areas of jurisdiction
    - [***Criminal Code***](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46){:target=" \_blank"}, R.S.C., 1985, c. C-46: Canada’s primary criminal law statute. 
    - [***Controlled Drugs and Substances Act***](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-38.8){:target=" \_blank"}, S.C. 1996, c. 19: Canada’s specialized statute dealing with illicit drugs.
    - [***Youth Criminal Justice Act***](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/Y-1.5){:target=" \_blank"}, S.C. 2002, c. 1: Canada’s criminal law statute governing persons who allegedly committed an offence(s) while under the age of eighteen years.
- **Common Law:** judicial decisions by various levels of courts, which is also referred to as “judge-made law”, “case law” or jurisprudence


!!! info "Alan W Mewett, “*The Criminal Law, 1867-1967*”"

    - One significant change was that enacted by **section 8 [now s 9]** stating:
    
        > Notwithstanding anything in this Act or any other Act, no person shall be convicted or discharged under section 736

        > (a) of **an offence at common law**, 

    - On the other hand, **section 7(2) [now s 8(3)]** providing:

        > Every rule and principle of the common law that renders any circumstance a justification or excuse for an act or a **defence** to a charge continues in force and applies in respect of proceedings for an offence under this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada, except insofar as they are altered by or are inconsistent with this Act or any other Act of the Parliament of Canada.

## Discussion: Federal Gov't Options

What options does the federal government have if it disagrees with a judicial decision interpreting the Criminal Code? Are there any limitations to those options?

!!! quote "Answer"

    - First, the government may appeal the decision to a higher court, provided there is a right of appeal or leave is granted. 
    - Second, if the judicial interpretation is final or remains unsatisfactory after appeals are exhausted, the government may pursue a legislative response by introducing a bill to amend the Criminal Code.
    - However, the legislative route is neither simple nor guaranteed. Moreover, legislative amendments remain subject to constitutional limits. 

## 1.3 Criminal Offences and Defences

A criminal offence is comprised of two key elements: the ***actus reus*** or prohibited conduct, and the ***mens rea*** or mental fault. 

Before the **abolition of common law offences** by the 1953 *Criminal Code*, the Supreme Court of Canada in ***Frey v Fedoruk*** (a civil action for false imprisonment and malicious prosecution) had decided not to increase the number of common law offences and thus refused to declare it to be an offence to be a “peeping tom.”

Supreme Court of Canada found that criminal law defences may appear in **statute**, but may also continue to be recognized at **common law** by the courts.

Section 8(3) of the *Criminal Code* (“**Common law principles continued**”), was the provision interpreted in ***Amato v. The Queen***, [1982 CanLII 31 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1lpcs){:target=" \_blank"} as confirming the ongoing ability of the courts to recognize new defences at common law.

In some instances, the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*, specifically section 7 (principles of fundamental justice) has been interpreted to require that certain defences be available to accused persons. 

## 1.4 Interpreting the Criminal Code

The modern approach (also called the **purposive and contextual approach**) to statutory interpretation is how the *Criminal Code* is interpreted today. 

In ***Schreiber v. Canada (Attorney General)***, [2002 SCC 62](https://canlii.ca/t/51rl){:target=" \_blank"}. Justice LeBel explained the rule as follows:

> [56] A principle of **bilingual statutory interpretation** holds that where one version is ambiguous and the other is clear and unequivocal, **the common meaning of the two versions would a priori be preferred**; Furthermore, where one of the two versions is broader than the other, **the common meaning would favour the more restricted or limited meaning**.

The rule of **strict construction** of penal statutes: This rule holds that when interpreting a penal statute, including the *Criminal Code*, any **real textual ambiguities should be resolved in a way that benefits the accused**. 

As the Court explained in ***Bell ExpressVu Limited Partnership v. Rex***, [2002 SCC 42](https://canlii.ca/t/51s6){:target=" \_blank"}, one must **first apply this normal, “modern approach”** to statutory interpretation to determine whether an ambiguity truly exists.

> Today there is only one principle or approach, namely, the words of an Act are to be read in their entire context and in their grammatical and ordinary sense harmoniously with the **scheme** of the Act, the **object** of the Act, and the **intention** of Parliament.

“Other principles of interpretation, such as the **strict construction** of penal statutes and the ***Charter* values presumption**, only receive application where there is ambiguity as to the meaning of a provision” (at para 28). 

## 2.1 The Onus & Standard of Proof

**The main onus of proof in criminal matters is the Crown’s onus** to prove the offence charged and to establish the Accused’s guilt. 

The standard of proof refers to **how much evidence the Crown or Defence must present in order to prove an issue** in a criminal trial. The **highest** standard of proof in Canadian criminal law is proof **beyond a reasonable doubt**. This is the overarching standard to which Crown must prove the offence charged and the Accused’s guilt.

The decision in ***R. v. Lifchus***, [1997 CanLII 319 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fqzt){:target=" \_blank"} is a leading case setting out the meaning of “proof beyond a reasonable doubt”.

!!! info "*Lifchus*"

    - 30 It will suffice to instruct the jury that **a reasonable doubt is a doubt based on reason and common sense which must be logically based upon the evidence or lack of evidence**.
    - 31 They (jurors) should be instructed that a reasonable doubt **cannot be based on sympathy or prejudice**.  Further they should be told that a reasonable doubt **must not be imaginary or frivolous**.  As well they must be advised that the Crown is not required to prove its case to **an absolute certainty** since such an unrealistically high standard could seldom be achieved.
    - 32 They should be told that proof establishing **a probability of guilt is not sufficient** to establish guilt beyond a reasonable doubt.

**Section 11(d)** of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* enshrined the presumption of innocence in our constitutional law. It states:

> Any person charged with an offence has the right ... to be presumed innocent until proven guilty according to law in a fair and public hearing by an independent and impartial tribunal.

## Discussion Activity: ***R. v. Keegstra***, [1990 CanLII 24 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fsr1){:target=" \_blank"}

Did section 319(2) violate Keegstra’s presumption of innocence, and if so, was that violation justified under s.1 of the *Charter*?


!!! quote "Answer"

    - One of the legal issues in ***Keegstra*** is whether sections 319(2) and 319(3)(a) of the *Criminal Code* violate the presumption of innocence principle in the common law and section 11(d) of the *Charter*, and thus reverse the burden of proof from the prosecution to the accused.
    - Both the majority and dissenting justices found that the provisions violate section 11(d) of the *Charter*, but they diverge in the second phase of the analysis. 
    - The majority held that the violation is justified under section 1, while the dissents argued that it could not be saved by section 1 because there lacks a “rational connection” between the aims of s. 319(3)(a) and its requirement that the accused prove the truth of his statements, and because the effects of the infringement and the objectives it promotes raise proportionality concerns.

In ***R. v. Downey***, [1992 CanLII 109 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fsbb){:target=" \_blank"}, **Cory J** provided the following summary of the principles that emerged from the s 11(d) jurisprudence to date:

1. The presumption of innocence is infringed whenever the accused is liable to be convicted despite the existence of a reasonable doubt.
2. If by the provisions of a statutory presumption, an accused is required to establish, that is to say to prove or disprove, on a balance of probabilities either an element of an offence or an excuse, then it contravenes s. 11(d). Such a provision would permit a conviction in spite of a reasonable doubt.
3. statutory presumptions which infringe s 11(d) may still be justified pursuant to s. 1 of the *Charter*. (As, for example, in ***Keegstra***, *supra*.)

The standard jury instructions in ***Lifchus***, often **supplemented by an explanation**, inspired by ***Starr***, that **proof beyond a reasonable doubt is closer to certainty than probability**. 


!!! info "*R. v. Starr*, [2000 SCC 40](https://canlii.ca/t/525l){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - It will be of great assistance for a jury if the trial judge situates the reasonable doubt standard appropriately between these two standards. I am in agreement with Twaddle J.A. in the court below, when he said, at p. 177:

        > If standards of proof were marked on a measure, proof “beyond reasonable doubt” would lie much closer to “absolute certainty” than to “a balance of probabilities.” 

## 2.2 Judges and Juries

Crown Counsel can charge an Accused either by **summary conviction** or by **indictment** (“in-dite-ment”). 

This independence is vital to fostering public confidence in the fairness and objectivity of the justice system. Three principles protect it:

- **Administrative independence:** Judges oversee the administration of the courts; the government does not set hearing dates or assign a judge to a particular case.
- **Financial security:** An independent body, the Judicial Compensation and Benefits Commission, reviews judges’ salaries, benefits and retirement annuities, and recommends improvements and changes.
- **Security of tenure:** Judges can remain on the bench until retirement; they cannot be removed from office unless an independent investigation determines they are unfit or guilty of misconduct.

In addition to independence, judges are expected to maintain **integrity** and **impartiality**.

Section 11(f) of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* gives an Accused the right to a jury trial for serious offences as follows:

> 11 Any person charged with an offence has the right

> (f) except in the case of an offence under military law tried before a military tribunal, to the benefit of trial by jury where the maximum punishment for the offence is **imprisonment for five years or a more** severe punishment;

!!! info "***R. v. Gunning***, [2005 SCC 27](https://canlii.ca/t/1kt5b){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - ... but the **jury**, who must take its direction on the law from the judge, is the **sole arbiter on the facts**. The judge is also entitled to give an opinion on a question of fact and express it as strongly as the circumstances permit, so long as it is made clear to the jury that the opinion is given as **advice** and **not direction**.
    - 28 Subject to one exception, it is also the **exclusive domain of the jury to determine the verdict**. An exception lies where the judge is satisfied that there is no evidence upon which a properly instructed jury could reasonably convict, in which case, it is the judge’s duty to direct the jury to acquit the accused. **However, there is no corresponding duty or entitlement to direct a jury to return a verdict of guilty.** 
    - 29 As a corollary of the trial judge’s duty to instruct the jury on the law, it is a well-established principle that a judge should **withdraw a defence** from the consideration of the jury when there is no evidence upon which a properly instructed jury acting reasonably could find in the accused’s favour. This threshold test, requiring that **a defence be put to the jury only if there is an evidential foundation for it**, is often referred to as the **“air of reality” test**.
    - 30 In every trial where there is no plea of guilty or an admission by the accused as to one or more of the essential elements of the offence, **the question of whether the Crown has met its burden is necessarily at play and must be put to the jury for its determination.** This “defence” is squarely before the jury. There is no further threshold to meet. 
    - 31 Hence, **it is never the function of the judge in a jury trial to assess the evidence and make a determination that the Crown has proven one or more of the essential elements of the offence and to direct the jury accordingly.**

## 2.3 Crown Prosecutors

**Both lawyers** representing the Crown (the Prosecutor) and the Accused (Defence Counsel) introduce evidence and make submissions on the facts an on the law.

A Crown Prosecutor’s role is not to secure convictions. His or her role is a public duty to **help the court arrive at a just result**.

***Boucher v. The Queen***, [1954 CanLII 3 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1nlk7){:target=" \_blank"} remains a leading Supreme Court of Canada decision on the role of the Crown Prosecutor:

> It cannot be over-emphasized that the purpose of a criminal prosecution is not to obtain a conviction, it is to lay before a jury what the Crown considers to be credible evidence relevant to what is alleged to be a crime. The role of prosecutor excludes any notion of winning or losing; his function is a matter of public duty than which in civil life there can be none charged with greater personal responsibility. It is to be efficiently performed with an ingrained sense of the dignity, the seriousness and the just­ness of judicial proceedings.

This case, ***R. v. Anderson***, [2014 SCC 41](https://canlii.ca/t/g784t){:target=" \_blank"}, provides an overview of “prosecutorial discretion”.

!!! info "*Anderson*"

    - ... **the prosecutor’s decision is a matter of prosecutorial discretion which is reviewable by the courts only for abuse of process**. 
    - [37] This Court has repeatedly affirmed that prosecutorial discretion is a necessary part of a properly functioning criminal justice system ... the fundamental importance of prosecutorial discretion was said to lie, 

        > not in protecting the interests of individual Crown attorneys, but in advancing the public interest by enabling prosecutors to make discretionary decisions in fulfilment of their professional obligations without fear of judicial or political interference, thus fulfilling their quasijudicial role as ‘ministers of justice.’” 

!!! info "*Anderson* Cont'd"
    
    - [45] In sum, prosecutorial discretion applies to a wide range of prosecutorial decision making. That said, care must be taken to distinguish matters of prosecutorial discretion from constitutional obligations. **The distinction between prosecutorial discretion and the constitutional obligations of the Crown was made** in ***Krieger***, where the prosecutor’s duty to disclose relevant evidence to the accused was at issue:

        > ... disclosure of relevant evidence is not, therefore, a matter of prosecutorial discretion but, rather, is a prosecutorial duty. 

        Manifestly, **the Crown possesses no discretion to breach the *Charter* rights of an accused**. In other words, prosecutorial discretion provides no shield to a Crown prosecutor who has failed to fulfill his or her constitutional obligations such as the duty to provide proper disclosure to the defence.
    - [46] The many decisions that Crown prosecutors are called upon to make in the exercise of their prosecutorial discretion must not be subjected to routine second-guessing by the courts. **Judicial non-interference** with prosecutorial discretion has been referred to as a “matter of principle based on the doctrine of **separation of powers** as well as a matter of policy founded on the **efficiency of the system of criminal justice**” which also recognizes that prosecutorial discretion is “especially ill-suited to judicial review”.
    - [48] Manifestly, prosecutorial discretion is entitled to considerable deference. **It is not, however, immune from all judicial oversight.** This Court has repeatedly affirmed that **prosecutorial discretion is reviewable for abuse of process**: ***Krieger***, at para. 32; ***Nixon***, at para. 31; ***Miazga***, at para. 46. 
    - **(ii) The Threshold Evidentiary Burden** 
    - [52] The **burden of proof** for establishing abuse of process lies on the **claimant**, who must prove it on **a balance of probabilities**. However, given the unique nature of prosecutorial discretion, specifically, the fact that the Crown will typically (if not always) be the only party who will know why a particular decision was made, this Court in ***Nixon*** recognized that **where prosecutorial discretion is challenged, the Crown may be required to provide reasons justifying its decision** where the claimant establishes a proper evidentiary foundation: para. 60.

## Discussion Activity: Crown Prosecutors and the *BC Code*


!!! quote "Answer"

    I noticed Rule 2.1-1(b) is of special importance in relation to this section’s topic. It provides that: “When engaged as a Crown prosecutor, a lawyer’s primary duty is not to seek a conviction but to see that justice is done; to that end the lawyer should make timely disclosure to the defence of all facts and known witnesses whether tending to show guilt or innocence, or that would affect the punishment of the accused.” This provision can be crunched into two core parts.

    First, it clarifies the orientation of the prosecutor’s role: the Crown is not a partisan actor whose objective is to secure convictions, but a minister of justice whose responsibility is to ensure that the process is fair and that outcomes are just. 

    Second, the rule sets out the prosecutor’s most important operational duty: disclosure. The Crown must make timely disclosure of all relevant facts and witnesses, not only those that advance the prosecution’s case, but also those that tend to show innocence or that may affect punishment. This obligation ensures that the accused can make full answer and defence and that the trial is not distorted by selective presentation of evidence.

    This ethical framework is consistent with the Supreme Court of Canada’s approach in ***Boucher v. The Queen***, 1954 CanLII 3 (SCC), where the Court emphasized that the Crown’s role is not to obtain a conviction at all costs, but to present the case firmly and fairly as a minister of justice.

One of the duties of a Crown Prosecutor is to ensure full and timely disclosure of all potentially relevant information to the Accused, subject to certain limited exceptions (usually involving “**privilege**”).

The duty to provide disclosure is now a constitutional requirement, as set out by ***R. v. Stinchcombe***, [1991 CanLII 45 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fsgp){:target=" \_blank"}.

> Subject to the Crown's discretion, **all relevant information must be disclosed**, both that which the Crown intends to introduce into evidence and that which it does not, and whether the evidence is **inculpatory** or **exculpatory**.

The most **serious consequence** of a Crown Prosecutor not following their duties and responsibilities is that they may contribute to **wrongful convictions**.

## Discussion Activity: Wrongful Convictions

!!! quote "Answer"

    By withholding crucial evidence, entering into undisclosed bargains with jailhouse informants, relying on questionable testimony, or using coerced confessions, a Crown prosecutor can mislead both the jury and the court and thereby contribute to a wrongful conviction.

    The objective reason this can occur is that Crown prosecutors enjoy a high degree of prosecutorial discretion, which is reviewable by the courts only on the narrow ground of abuse of process.

    The subjective reason in this case is that the prosecutor, **George Dangerfield**, disregarded the proper purpose of a criminal prosecution, which is not to obtain a conviction, but to see that justice is done for both the accused and the victims. 

    There are several ways to prevent prosecutorial abuse of process. One of the most important and effective is full and timely disclosure of all potentially relevant information to the accused.

## 2.4 Defence Counsel

Rather, Defence Counsel also have obligations as “**officers of the court**”.

All lawyers are subject to the rules of professional conduct and ethics, including both **Crown Prosecutors** and **Defence Counsel**.

The *Federation of Law Societies of Canada*’s [Model Code of Professional Conduct (2017)](https://flsc.ca/what-we-do/model-code-of-professional-conduct/interactive-model-code-of-professional-conduct/){:target=" \_blank"}, provides as follows:

> 5.1-1 When acting as an advocate, **a lawyer must represent the client resolutely and honourably within the limits of the law**, while treating the tribunal with candour, fairness, courtesy and respect.

> [9] Duty as Defence Counsel: When defending an accused person, a lawyer’s duty is to protect the client as far as possible **from being convicted**, except by a tribunal of competent jurisdiction and upon legal evidence sufficient to support a conviction for the offence with which the client is charged.

> [3] A lawyer is never required to take or keep possession of incriminating physical evidence or to disclose its mere existence. Possession of illegal things could constitute an offense. **A lawyer in possession of incriminating physical evidence** should carefully consider his or her options. These options include, as soon as reasonably possible:

> - (a) delivering the evidence to law enforcement authorities or the prosecution, either directly or anonymously; 
> - (b) delivering the evidence to the tribunal in the relevant proceeding, which may also include seeking the direction of the tribunal to facilitate access by the prosecution or defence for testing or examination; or 
> - (c) disclosing the existence of the evidence to the prosecution and, if necessary, preparing to argue before a tribunal the appropriate uses, disposition or admissibility of it. 

**Solicitor and client privilege** will be studied in your evidence course. Although privilege is zealously protected, a number of **exceptions** have been recognized, including 

- (1) when it must be revealed as the only means to demonstrate the innocence of the accused, 
- (2) when the communications themselves are criminal in nature, and 
- (3) for public safety reasons relating to a clear and serious risk of serious harm to an identifiable person or group of people. 

***Model Code:*** A lawyer at all times must hold in strict confidence all information concerning the business and affairs of a client acquired in the course of the professional relationship and must not divulge any such information **unless**: 

- (a) expressly or impliedly **authorized** by the client;
- (b) **required** by law or a court to do so; 
- (c) **required** to deliver the information to the Law Society; or 
- (d) otherwise **permitted** by this rule.

## 2.5 Classification of Offences

All offences in the *Criminal Code* are classified by Parliament when they are enacted by legislation. The words that create the offence itself, or the penalty provision appearing after it, will identify the offence as “**summary**” or “**indictable**” (pronounced “in-dite-a-ble”), or indicate that it can be either summary or indictable, meaning it is a “**hybrid**” offence.

The **maximum penalty** for this type of offence (summary conviction offence) is **2 years (less a day)** in jail and/or a **$5000 fine**, unless the offence prescribes a different penalty (see *Criminal Code* s. 787.) 

For certain offences, the Crown may “elect” (decide) to proceed either summarily or by indictment – these are known as “**hybrid**” offences. 

When an Accused is charged with a hybrid offence, it is **deemed to be indictable, unless and until the Crown elects to proceed by summary conviction**: *Interpretation Act*, s. 34(1)(a). (Adapted from: Janine Benedet, Casebook: 2007-2008, Ch. 1.)

## 2.6 Overview of Pre-trial and Trial Procedures

Criminal proceedings begin with a police investigation into criminal activity. In B.C., once an officer has gathered enough evidence to support a prosecution, he or she will **submit a police report to Crown Counsel**. This report is called a **Report to Crown Counsel** (“**RTCC**”) and includes typed narratives from each officer involved in the investigation explaining what they did, saw and learned during the investigation. The RTCC also includes a copy of all evidence gathered by police including photographs, videos, witness statements, fingerprint analysis and more.

Crown Counsel reviews the RTCC and **assesses the file for charge approval**. 

When assessing RTCCs for charge approval, the **Provincial Crown** apply a **two pronged standard**: 

- (1) there must be **enough evidence** to support a substantial likelihood of conviction, and 
- (2) it must be in the **public interest** to prosecute. 

The **Federal Crown** apply a slightly different **two pronged standard**: 

- (1) there must be enough evidence to support **a reasonable prospect** of conviction, and 
- (2) it must also be in the public interest to prosecute.

It is matter of **Crown discretion** whether to lay charges against an individual, who will thereafter be referred to as the “Accused”.

In Canada, **very few criminal charges proceed to trial**. In most cases, the Accused will either admit their guilt (“**plead guilty**”) and proceed to sentencing without a trial (often involving a **plea agreement** with the Crown Prosecutor that the judge must ultimately approve or depart from), or the Crown Prosecutor “stays” (**drops**) the charges due to there no longer being a substantial likelihood of conviction or because it is no longer in the public interest to prosecute.

If an Accused denies the charges (“**pleads not guilty**”) then a trial will ensue.

***Pre-Trial***

**Arraignment**: Formal reading of the charge to the Accused and entering of a plea. If the plea is “Guilty,” the Accused proceeds to sentencing.  If s/he pleads “Not Guilty” then a **trial** or **Preliminary Hearing** (This is similar to a trial but there is a lesser evidentiary threshold) is scheduled. 

## 3.1 Introduction

At common law, and now under section 7 of the *Charter*, every criminal offence must include **prohibited conduct** (*actus reus*) accompanied by the **requisite mental state** (*mens rea*).

The concept of *actus reus* refers to more than simply a prohibited action; *actus reus* comprises a bundle of components that, together, constitute the “guilty act.” Put most helpfully, the *actus reus* requires a 

- **Physical voluntariness** – that the Accused did the prohibited physical action on purpose (this is discussed more in the next topic)
- **Act or omission** – what the Accused physically did (or didn’t do in the case of an omission)
- Sometimes in **prescribed circumstances** – for instance, if someone is charged with “assaulting a police officer”, the prescribed circumstance is that the assaulted person must have been a police officer.
- Sometimes causing **certain consequences** – for example, if someone is charged with “assault causing bodily harm”, the required consequence of the prohibited act (the assault) is that the assaulted person was harmed.

## 3.2 Voluntariness

The first of the elements of the *actus reus* is the requirement for voluntary conduct. The essential characteristic of voluntariness is the **conscious control of action**. Consciousness alone, however, is not enough to establish voluntariness because a person might be conscious and yet still be incapable of controlling his or her conduct. In sum, **the voluntariness of a person’s conduct will be established if his or her conduct is the product of conscious choice.** 

The Supreme Court of Canada decision in ***Ruzic*** confirms that both at common law and under section 7 of the *Charter*, **there can be no criminal liability unless the conduct was voluntary**. The test for physical voluntariness set out by the Court is that it requires a “**conscious mind and a controlled body**” – if either of these is lacking, there is no physical voluntariness, and no crime has occurred. 

## 3.3 Acts & Omissions

Most criminal offences require that an Accused commit a **positive act**. Certain offences can be committed by **failing to act** (e.g. **omissions**). These involve situations where the Accused was **under a legal duty** to act and failed to do so.



The **common factor in omission offences** is that they all require people to act in a way that fulfills a duty that is imposed upon them. Sometimes this duty is built right into a *Criminal Code* offence section. These are called “**specific omission offences**” and their *Code* sections both create a duty to act and then criminalize a failure to meet that duty. An example is s.129(1)(b) which makes it an offence to not assist a peace officer.

There are also “**general omission offences**” which are more vague. These sections criminalize a failure to **perform a duty that is undefined**. For general omission offences, these **“legal duties”** can come from one of two places: **statute** or the **common law**. 

- Statutory duties are written right into the *Code* itself or another piece of legislation. 
- Common law duties are more controversial and are created when someone undertakes to do something in the nature of **a binding commitment**. That commitment must be **expressed clearly** and others must place **reliance on it** (see ***R. v. Browne***).

**The common law in these cases only creates the duty**. It is the *Criminal Code* section (e.g. **s.217 or s.219**) that then **creates the offence**. This is how common law duties to act are not contrary to s.9, they does not create offences. Rather, they create duties that statutory sections then criminalize a failure to act on.

!!! example "s 217 & 219 *Criminal Code*"

    *Duty of persons undertaking acts*

    **217** Every one who undertakes to do an act is under a legal duty to do it if an omission to do the act is or may be dangerous to life.

    *Criminal negligence*

    **219** (1) Every one is criminally negligent who
        
    - (a) in doing anything, or
    - (b) in omitting to do anything that it is his duty to do,
    
    shows wanton or reckless disregard for the lives or safety of other persons.

    *Definition of duty*

    (2) For the purposes of this section, duty means a duty imposed by law.

!!! info "*R. v. Browne*, [1997 CanLII 1744 (ON CA)](https://canlii.ca/t/6h8v){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - [15] **What kind of an undertaking gives rise to a legal duty** within the meaning of s. 217, the breach of which can result in criminal culpability? The threshold definition must be sufficiently **high** to justify such serious penal consequences. The mere expression of words indicating a willingness to do an act cannot trigger the legal duty. There must be something in the nature of a **commitment**, generally, though not necessarily, **upon which reliance can reasonably be said to have been placed**. 

Be able to define an **omission offence** in your own words. Know that they can be **created by statute (the most common) or by common law (less common)**. In what circumstances can the common law impose on someone a duty to act?

When considering a fact pattern with an omission offence, first ask yourself “**was there a duty to act?**” And if so, “**what section of the Code (if statutory) created that duty?**” Next consider whether that **duty applied** to the Accused in your fact pattern. Finally, if the duty applied, you will want to analyse whether the Accused **met/fulfilled/discharged that duty**.

## 3.4 Causation & Consequences

**==Some criminal offences== require that the Accused’s act or omission cause a certain consequence or result.** “Causation” is the link between the act or omission and the alleged consequence or result: the prohibited conduct (act/omission) causes the prohibited consequence for there to be liability. Where they are part of an offence, **causation and the prohibited consequence must be proven beyond a reasonable doubt** by the Crown.

Having demonstrated that a line can be drawn connecting the accused’s conduct to the prohibited consequence, the **more difficult question** is deciding whether this causal connection is **sufficiently strong** to support criminal liability. 

Factual situations that raise causation as an issue can become extremely complicated. It is a good idea sometimes to draw out a diagram of the facts to help clearly identify the role of the Accused in a situation, as well as to note any **potential intervening acts**, **pre-existing frailties** of the victim (e.g. the “**thin skull rule**”), or **contributions of any third parties**.

***Smithers*** establishes a very **low threshold for causation** in the criminal law. It is, however, a pre-*Charter* case, decided in 1978. 


!!! info "*Smithers v. R.*, [1977 CanLII 7 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1mk9r){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - **The issue of causation is for the jury and not the experts**. The weight to be given to the evidence of the experts was entirely for the jury. In the search for truth, **the jury was entitled to consider all of the evidence, expert and lay, and accept or reject any part of it**. Non-medical testimony is available to both the Crown and the accused, and in the instant case lay evidence was vital to the defence raised by the appellant.
    - The second sub-question raised is whether there was evidence on the basis of which the jury was entitled to find that it had been established **beyond a reasonable doubt that the kick caused the death**. In answer to this question it may shortly be said that there was a very substantial body of evidence, both expert and lay, before the jury indicating that **the kick was at least a contributing cause of death**, outside the *de minimis* range, and that is all that the Crown was required to establish. **It is immaterial that the death was in part caused by a malfunctioning epiglottis, to which malfunction the appellant may, or may not, have contributed.** 
    - It is a well-recognized principle that one who assaults another must take his victim as he finds him. Although causation in civil cases differs from that in a criminal case, the “**thin skulled man**” may appear in the criminal law as in the civil law. The case of ***R. v. Nicholson (1926)***, 47 C.C.C. 113 (C.A.), will serve as an illustration.

The ***Smithers*** test governs analysis of legal causation for almost all crimes in Canada. There is, however, one area of the criminal law in which a different and **more stringent causation test** is used. The Supreme Court established this higher threshold for causation, applicable to a subset of the forms of **first-degree murder**, in the ***Harbottle*** decision.


!!! info "*R. v. Harbottle*, [1993 CanLII 71 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fs0z){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - The consequences of a conviction for **first degree murder** and the wording of the section are such that the **test of causation for s. 214(5) must be a strict one**. In my view, an accused may only be convicted under the subsection if the Crown establishes that the accused has committed **an act or series of acts** which are of such a nature that they must be regarded as **a substantial and integral cause of the death**. 
    - Obviously, this requirement is much higher than that described in ***Smithers v. The Queen***, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 506, which dealt with the offence of manslaughter. There it was held at p. 519 that sufficient causation existed where the actions of the accused were “a contributing cause of death, outside the *de minimis* range.” **That case demonstrates the distinctions in the degree of causation required for the different homicide offences**.

In ***R. v. Nette***, [2001] 3 SCR 488, the Supreme Court of Canada sets out the **current test for causation** for criminal offences. Justice Arbour, for the majority, held that the test for causation is whether the conduct of the Accused was a “**significant contributing cause**” of the prohibited consequence. **This test applies to all homicide offences, and is the general test for causation for other Criminal Code offences.** 


!!! info "*R. v. Nette*, [2001 SCC 78](https://canlii.ca/t/51x9){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - [70] ... I agree with **Lambert J.A.** that even if it were desirable to formulate a causation test for second degree murder that is higher than the ***Smithers*** standard for **manslaughter** but less strict than the ***Harbottle*** standard for **first degree murder** under s. 231(5), which **I conclude it is not**, it would be difficult to formulate such a test in a meaningful way and even more difficult for a jury to grasp the subtle nuances and apply three different standards of causation. 
    - [71] The causation standard expressed in ***Smithers*** is still **valid and applicable to all forms of homicide**. ... In order to explain the standard as clearly as possible to the jury, it may be preferable to phrase the standard of causation in positive terms using a phrase such as “**significant contributing cause**” rather than using expressions phrased in the negative such as “not a trivial cause” or “not insignificant.” Latin terms such as “*de minimis*” are rarely helpful. 
    - [88] ... There is only **one standard of causation for homicide offences**, including second degree murder. That standard may be expressed using different terminology, but it remains the standard expressed by this Court in the case of ***Smithers***, *supra*. The terminology of substantial cause in ***Harbottle*** is used to indicate the increased degree of participation in the killing that is required to raise the accused’s culpability to first degree murder under s. 231(5) of the ***Code***. ***Harbottle* did not raise the standard of causation that applies to all homicide offences from the standard expressed in *Smithers*.** 


**Actions of Third Parties and the Causation Analysis**

***Pagett v. The Queen***, (1983), 76 Cr. App. R. 279 (Court of Criminal Appeal, England) offers an interesting fact pattern that illuminates why an Accused is criminally responsible for causing the death of a person that they were using as a **human shield**. 

In these situations (Shoot-outs in public and street-races), Accused persons have been found to have been “taken to assume any **consequential risk objectively within the ambit of the danger created**”: ***R. v. Menezes*** (2002), 50 C.R. (5th) 343 (Ontario Superior Court).

In ***R. v. Maybin***, 2012 SCC 24, the Supreme Court of Canada clarified when an **intervening act** can be said to **break the chain of causation** and affirmed the “significant contributing cause” test remains pivotal to the causation analysis.


In the following case the Supreme Court of Canada offered an approach for assessing **intervening causes** and whether a subsequent event has **severed the chain** of causation between the accused’s acts and the proscribed consequence.

!!! info "*R. v. Maybin*, [2012 SCC 24](https://canlii.ca/t/frczg){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - [5] ... the test for legal causation set out by this Court in ***Smithers v. The Queen***, [1978] 1 S.C.R. 506, and confirmed in ***R. v. Nette***, 2001 SCC 78, [2001] 3 S.C.R. 488: **Were the unlawful acts of the appellants a significant contributing cause of death?**
    - [15] In ***Nette***, this Court affirmed the validity of the *de minimis* causation standard expressed in ***Smithers*** for culpable homicide. Writing for the majority, Arbour J. noted that **causation in homicide cases involves two aspects**: **factual** and **legal causation**. **Factual causation** is “an inquiry about how the victim came to his or her death, in a medical, mechanical, or physical sense, and with the contribution of the accused to that result” (***Nette***, at para. 44). **The trier of fact usually asks: “But for”** the action(s) of the accused, would the death have occurred?
    - [16] **Legal causation**, however, is a narrowing concept which funnels a wider range of factual causes into those which are **sufficiently connected** to a harm to warrant legal responsibility. Arbour J. noted that legal causation is “based on concepts of **moral responsibility** and is **not a mechanical or mathematical exercise**” (***Nette***, at para. 83). 
    - [28] **Neither** an unforeseeable intervening act **nor** an independent intervening act is necessarily a **sufficient condition to break the chain** of legal causation. Similarly, the fact that the intervening act was reasonably foreseeable, or was not an independent act, is not necessarily a sufficient condition to establish legal causation. ... the causation test articulated in ***Smithers*** and confirmed in ***Nette*** remains the same: **Were the dangerous, unlawful acts of the accused a significant contributing cause of the victim’s death?**
    - [29] Depending on the circumstances, assessments of **foreseeability** or **independence** may be more or less **helpful** in determining whether an accused’s unlawful acts were still a significant contributing cause at the time of death.
    - [30] An intervening act that is **reasonably foreseeable** will usually not break or rupture the chain of causation so as to relieve the offender of legal responsibility for the unintended result. ... it accords with our notions of **moral accountability**.
    - [34] In my view, the chain of causation should not be broken only because the specific subsequent attack by the bouncer was not reasonably foreseeable. From the perspective of moral responsibility, it is **sufficient** if the **general nature of the intervening act and the risk of non-trivial harm are objectively foreseeable** at the time of the dangerous and unlawful acts.

**Improper Medical Care and Causation Analysis**

The *Criminal Code* specifies that **improper medical care** applied after the conduct of the Accused **does not break the chain** of causation. 

!!! info "[Section 225](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/c-46/page-35.html#h-119746){:target=" \_blank"} of the *Criminal Code*"

    *Death from treatment of injury* 
    
    **225** Where a person causes to a human being a bodily injury that is of itself of a dangerous nature and from which death results, he causes the death of that human being **notwithstanding** that the immediate cause of death is **proper or improper treatment** that is applied **in good faith**.

==**Study Tips**==

Devise a framework for analysing causation fact patterns. A good approach is to first consider 

- (1) whether there was **factual** causation, then 
- (2) whether there was **legal** causation. 
- (3) You can then go on to consider any other circumstances in the fact pattern that affect causation, such as 
    - intervening factors, 
    - thin skulls, and 
    - improper medical treatment. 

## 4.1 Mental Fault (Mens Rea) Introduction

Only the federal Parliament has jurisdiction to enact criminal offences (e.g offences in the *Criminal Code* and *Controlled Drugs and Substances Act*). **If the offence you are considering comes from one of these two statutes, you can be almost certain that you are dealing with a true criminal offence.**

On the other hand, regulatory offences involve conduct that is not inherently wrongful, but if it were unregulated it would present some danger to society. **Both the federal Parliament and provincial legislatures may enact regulatory offences within their respective areas of jurisdiction** (e.g. provincial health inspections of restaurants, federal air transport safety regulations).

It can be critically important how an offence is classified between criminal and regulatory. This is because each has **a starting presumption of the minimal level of *mens rea*** required.

## 4.2 Absolute & Strict Liability

As some regulatory offences can involve the possibility of imprisonment, **absolute liability** means that someone could possibly be liable to imprisonment without any mental fault at all. This would mean that even an “accident” could give rise to the possibility of imprisonment. As we will see, such a possibility is **not allowed** under the *Charter*. However, **for those regulatory offences that do not involve the possibility of imprisonment, absolute liability offences do still exist.**

In ***Reference Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act***, [1985 CanLII 81 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/dln){:target=" \_blank"}, the Supreme Court of Canada held that this provincial regulatory offence that involved absolute liability violated section 7 of the *Charter*. It was not saved by section 1 of the *Charter* because it exposed the Accused to the possibility of imprisonment without any mental fault. In short, **“absolute liability and imprisonment cannot be combined.”**

A new default standard of mental fault for such regulatory offences: “**strict liability**”. While it is a **low standard**, it does **involve a degree of mental fault**.

Strict liability means that once the Crown prosecutor has proven the *actus reus* of the offence **beyond a reasonable doubt**, the burden then shifts to the Accused to prove on **a balance of probabilities** that they exercised “**due diligence**” (e.g. took the steps that a reasonable person in the circumstances would have done).

In ***R. v. Sault Ste. Marie***, [1978 CanLII 11 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1mkbt){:target=" \_blank"}, the Supreme Court of Canada recognized for the first time that “**strict liability**” should be presumed at common law to be the **default level of mental fault for regulatory offences**. 

In ***Lévis (City) v. Tétreault; Lévis (City) v. 2629-4470 Québec inc.***, [2006 SCC 12](https://canlii.ca/t/1n0zk){:target=" \_blank"}, the Supreme Court of Canada affirmed the decision in ***R. v. Sault Ste. Marie*** and indicated that while it is still possible to have absolute liability offences if there is “clear proof of legislative intent”, such offences are now quite rare.

**Full Mens Rea**: Although **regulatory offences** are presumed to be strict liability, they are **capable of requiring “full *mens rea*”** as would a true criminal offence. This occurs when the otherwise regulatory provision has **express language** requiring a higher level of mental fault. For example, the provision might require that the Accused commit the act “**knowingly**”, or with “**intent**” or “**purpose**”. 

The following extract from Cory J’s judgment in ***Wholesale Travel Group Inc***, grapples with the distinction between “true criminal offences” and “regulatory offences.”

!!! info "*R. v. Wholesale Travel Group Inc.*, [1991 CanLII 39 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fsjf){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - ***R. v. Sault Ste. Marie***, [1978] 2 S.C.R. 1299, affirmed the **distinction** between regulatory offences and true crimes.
        - such offences, although enforced as penal laws through the machinery of the criminal law, “are in substance of a civil nature and might well be regarded as a branch of administrative law to which traditional principles of criminal law have but limited application.” 
    - The ***Sault Ste. Marie*** case recognized **strict liability** as a middle ground between full *mens rea* and absolute liability. 
        - Where the offence is one of strict liability, the Crown is required to prove neither *mens rea* nor negligence; conviction may follow merely upon proof **beyond a reasonable doubt** of the **proscribed act**. 
        - However, it is open to the defendant to avoid liability by proving **on a balance of probabilities** that all due care was taken. 
        - This is the hallmark of the strict liability offence: **the defence of due diligence**. 
    - The **objective** of regulatory legislation is to protect the public or broad segments of the public (such as employees, consumers and motorists, to name but a few) from the potentially adverse effects of otherwise lawful activity. 
    - While criminal offences are usually designed to condemn and punish past, inherently wrongful conduct, regulatory measures are generally **directed** to the prevention of future harm through the enforcement of minimum standards of conduct and care. 
    - Regulatory measures are the primary mechanisms employed by governments in Canada to **implement public policy objectives**. In short, regulation is absolutely essential for our protection and well being as individuals, and for the effective functioning of society. 

**THE EMERGENCE OF STRICT LIABILITY**

!!! info "*R. v. Sault Ste. Marie*, [1978 CanLII 11 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1mkbt){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - The correct approach, in my opinion, is to **relieve the Crown of the burden** of proving *mens rea*, having regard to ***Pierce Fisheries*** and to the virtual impossibility in most regulatory cases of proving wrongful intention. Equally, there is nothing wrong with **rejecting absolute liability and admitting the defence of reasonable care**. 
    - it is open to the defendant to prove that all due care has been taken. This **burden falls upon the defendant** as he is the only one who will generally have the means of proof. This would not seem unfair as the alternative is absolute liability which denies an accused any defence whatsoever. While the prosecution must prove **beyond a reasonable doubt** that the defendant committed the prohibited act, the defendant must only establish o**n the balance of probabilities** that he has a defence of reasonable care. 
    
!!! info "*R. v. Sault Ste. Marie*, [1978 CanLII 11 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1mkbt){:target=" \_blank"} Cont'd" 
    
    - I conclude, for the reasons which I have sought to express, that there are compelling grounds for the recognition of **three categories of offences** rather than the traditional two:
        - **Offences** in which *mens rea*, consisting of some positive state of mind such as intent, knowledge, or recklessness, must be proved by the prosecution either as an inference from the nature of the act committed, or by additional evidence.
        - **Offences** in which there is no necessity for the prosecution to prove the existence of *mens rea*; the doing of the prohibited act *prima facie* imports the offence, leaving it open to the accused to avoid liability by proving that he took all reasonable care. 
        - **Offences of absolute liability** where it is not open to the accused to exculpate himself by showing that he was free of fault.

The Supreme Court affirmed in 2006 that it would apply the “clear analytical framework and classification approach adopted in ***Sault Ste. Marie***” (at para 19) and that while “**absolute liability** offences still exist ... they have become an **exception** requiring clear proof of legislative intent” (at para 17). ***Lévis (City) v. Tétreault; Lévis (City) v. 2629-4470 Québec inc.***, [2006 SCC 12](https://canlii.ca/t/1n0zk){:target=" \_blank"}. 

!!! info "*Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act*, [1985 CanLII 81 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/dln){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - In other words, **absolute liability and imprisonment cannot be combined**.
    - A law enacting an **absolute liability** offence will violate s. 7 of the *Charter* **only if** and to the extent that it has the potential of **depriving of life, liberty, or security of the person**. 
    - ... no imprisonment may be imposed for an absolute liability offence, and, consequently, given the question put to us, an offence punishable by imprisonment cannot be an absolute liability offence. 
    - **Comment:** The Court subsequently held that **corporations do not enjoy s 7 rights** in ***Irwin Toy Ltd. v. Quebec (Attorney General)***, [1989 CanLII 87 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1ft6g){:target=" \_blank"}. At the same time, corporations charged with an offence that also applies to natural persons can still challenge the offence under s 7 as well as other rights under the *Charter*. That is why a corporation was able to challenge regulatory offences under s 7 of the *Charter* in ***R. v. Wholesale Travel Group Inc.***, [1991 CanLII 39 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fsjf){:target=" \_blank"}. Note that the rights in **s 11** of the *Charter*, including the presumption of innocence in s 11(d) of the *Charter*, **apply to all** those charged with an offence, including corporations.

## 4.3 Subjective vs. Objective Fault

Four different types of “**subjective fault**” (often referred to simply as *mens rea*): **intention**, **recklessness**, **knowledge**, and **wilful blindness**.

When analysing subjective fault, the focus is on what was in the Accused’s mind at the time of the offence. This can be proven through **direct evidence** (e.g. **an admissible confession** by the Accused stating that knew the victim was a police officer), but more often it is proven by **indirect or circumstantial evidence** where inferences lead to that conclusion (e.g. the victim was in full police uniform so that it can be inferred that the Accused knew he was a police officer).

In contrast, **“objective fault”**, does not ask what was going on in the mind of the Accused. Instead, the Accused’s behaviour is compared to what a “reasonable person” would have done or known in the circumstances.

**What a reasonable person would have realized or known** may be of value in the determination of what the accused actually thought. 

***Regina v. Buzzanga and Durocher***, [1979 CanLII 1927 (ON CA)](https://canlii.ca/t/g181w){:target=" \_blank"}:

> if a person does **an act likely to produce certain consequences** it is, in general, reasonable to assume that the Accused foresaw the probable consequences of his act and if he, nevertheless, acted so as to produce those consequences, that he intended them.

***Regina v. Tennant and Naccarato***, [1975 CanLII 605 (ON CA)](https://canlii.ca/t/g17dv){:target=" \_blank"}: 

> what **a reasonable man ought to have anticipated** is merely evidence from which a conclusion may be drawn that the Accused anticipated the same consequences.

## 4.4 Intention & Recklessness

Intention generally refers to the Accused’s conscious choice to engage in the prohibited conduct (i.e. they mean to engage in such conduct) and, if applicable, that they mean to cause the prohibited consequence.

In these readings, we find a helpful distinction between **intent** (which is the most onerous type of subjective mental fault for Crown to prove) and **motive** (**which is generally not required to be proven**, absent express statutory language). In ***Lewis v. The Queen***, [1979 CanLII 19 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1mkv6){:target=" \_blank"}, Chief Justice Dickson describes intent as “**the exercise of a free will to use particular means to produce a particular result**”, whereas motive is “that **which precedes and induces the exercise of will**”. Think of intention as being **what** the Accused meant to do, and of motive as being **why** the Accused chose to do it.

In cases where specific “intention” language is not use, **recklessness** may substitute in its place. Recklessness occurs when one “is aware that there is a danger that his conduct could bring about the result prohibited by the criminal law, nevertheless persists despite the risk.” It is “the conduct of one **who sees the risk and who takes the chance**” (***Sansregret v. The Queen***, [1985 CanLII 79 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fv0t){:target=" \_blank"}). 

There is a small **knowledge component** involved in recklessness, the knowledge that the behaviour one is engaging in has the potential to result in criminality.

In ***Sansregret***, the Supreme Court of Canada describes the concepts of **recklessness** and **wilful blindness** (discussed in our next topic) as **subjective types of mental fault**. The Court explains how recklessness involves the Accused being aware that there is a risk that his conduct could bring about the prohibited results, but nevertheless persists despite the risk.


!!! info "*R. v. Hibbert*, [1995 CanLII 110 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1frjf){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - As a practical matter, though, situations where **duress** will operate to “**negate**” *mens rea* will be **exceptional**, for the simple reason that the types of mental states that are capable of being “negated” by duress are not often found in the definitions of criminal offences. 
    - In general, a person who performs an action in response to a threat will know what he or she is doing, and will be aware of the probable consequences of his or her actions. Whether or not he or she **desires** the occurrence of these consequences will **depend on the particular circumstances**. 
    - The conclusions that can be extracted from the discussion in the previous sections may be summarized as follows:
        - A person who commits a criminal act under threats of death or bodily harm may also be able to **invoke an excuse-based defence** (either the statutory defence set out in **s. 17** or the common law defence of duress, depending on whether the accused is charged as a principal or as a party). This is so **regardless** of whether or not the offence at issue is one where the presence of coercion also has **a bearing on the existence** of *mens rea*. 
        - The mental states specified in **s. 21(1)(b)** and **(2)** of the *Criminal Code* are **not susceptible to being “negated” by duress**. Consequently, it is not open to persons charged under these sections to argue that because their acts were coerced by threats they lacked the requisite *mens rea*. Such persons may, however, seek to have their conduct **excused through the operation of the common law defence of duress**.

**Recklessness** often forms the** minimal subjective fault** that can be read into offences that contain no explicit fault requirement. In ***Sansregret***, the Supreme Court discussed **recklessness** and **its relation to wilful blindness**

!!! info "*Sansregret v. The Queen*, [1985 CanLII 79 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fv0t){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - **Negligence**, is frequently confused with **recklessness** in the criminal sense and care should be taken to separate the **two concepts**. 
        - **Negligence** is tested by the **objective standard of the reasonable man**. A departure from his accustomed sober behaviour by an act or omission which reveals less than reasonable care will involve liability at civil law but forms no basis for the imposition of criminal penalties. 
        - **Recklessness**, **must have an element of the subjective**. It is found in the attitude of one who, aware that there is danger that his conduct could bring about the result prohibited by the criminal law, **nevertheless persists**, despite the risk. It is, in other words, **the conduct of one who sees the risk and who takes the chance**. 
    - Wilful blindness is distinct from recklessness because, while **recklessness involves knowledge of a danger or risk and persistence in a course of conduct** which creates a risk that the prohibited result will occur, **wilful blindness** arises where a person who has become aware of the need for some inquiry **declines to make the inquiry because he does not wish to know the truth**. He would prefer to remain ignorant. 
        - The culpability in recklessness is **justified by** consciousness of the risk and by proceeding in the face of it, 
        - while in wilful blindness it is **justified by** the accused’s fault in deliberately failing to inquire when he knows there is reason for inquiry.

## 4.5 Knowledge & Willful Blindness

Knowledge generally requires a **“true belief”** in a certain state of affairs. For example, if someone is charged with assaulting a police officer, they must have known at the time that the victim was a police officer. Usually (but not always) an Accused must have knowledge of each essential element of the crime to have the requisite *mens rea* for the crime.

If a *Criminal Code* section uses specific language requiring **intention**, then **recklessness** cannot substitute. **Willful blindness, however, can always substitute in for knowledge**, ==even if the *Code* section specifies that the Accused do something “knowingly”.==

In ***R. v. Briscoe***, [2010 SCC 13](https://canlii.ca/t/29280){:target=" \_blank"}, **Justice Charron** for the majority of the Supreme Court of Canada describes wilful blindness not as a type of mental fault, but as a

> a “**doctrine that imputes knowledge to an Accused** whose suspicion is aroused to the point where he or she sees the need for further inquiries, but deliberately chooses not to make those inquiries”.

> ==Wilful blindness does not define the *mens rea* required for particular offences. Rather, it can **substitute for actual knowledge** whenever knowledge is a component of the *mens rea*.==

## 4.6 Criminal Negligence

Objective mental fault falls short of a “purely subjective inquiry” into what the Accused actually thought about, and instead considers what he or she **should have contemplated or ought to have perceived**. Such standards consider what a fictitious **“reasonable person”** would have thought, known or done in the circumstances. 

One clue as to whether an offence only requires objective mental fault is the use of the words “**ought**” or “**negligence**” in the language of the offence. 

Objective standards of fault in criminal law are somewhat **controversial**, and may be **unconstitutional** in certain circumstances that we will explore later in this topic, because they reflect a lower degree of moral blameworthiness. They have been recognized for only a small category of offences, usually based on **explicit statutory language**.  

In ***R. v. Hundal***, [1993 CanLII 120 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fs58){:target=" \_blank"}, Justice Cory for the majority said: “Although an objective test must be applied to the offence of dangerous driving, **it will remain open to the accused to raise a reasonable doubt that a reasonable person would have been aware of the risks of the accused’s conduct.** The test must be applied with some measure of flexibility.” He added that **personal factors of the accused need not be taken into account**.

In ***R. v. Creighton***, [1993 CanLII 61 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fs09){:target=" \_blank"}, the majority found that

> considerations of law and policy dictate the maintenance of **a single, uniform legal standard of care** for such offences, subject to **one exception**: **incapacity to appreciate the nature of the risk** which the activity in question entails. 

***R. v. Beatty***, [2008 SCC 5](https://canlii.ca/t/1vrp5){:target=" \_blank"} again deals with the offence of **dangerous driving causing death**. Justice Charron for the majority held that there must be a **“marked departure” from the standard of a reasonable person** for them to be criminally liable.


!!! info "*R. v. Creighton*, [1993 CanLII 61 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fs09){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - An accused can only be held to **the standard of a reasonable person** if the accused was capable, in the circumstances of the offence, of attaining that standard. Consequently, in determining whether a reasonable person in the circumstances of the accused would have foreseen the risk of death arising from the unlawful act, the trier of fact must **pay particular attention to any human frailties** which might have rendered the accused incapable of having foreseen what the reasonable person would have foreseen. 
    - **Human frailties** encompass personal characteristics habitually affecting an accused’s awareness of the circumstances which create risk. Such characteristics must be relevant to the ability to perceive the particular risk. It should be emphasized that the **relevant characteristics must be traits which the accused could not control or otherwise manage in the circumstances**. The reasonable person is **expected to compensate for his or her frailties**, to the extent he or she is conscious of them and able to do so.
    - The foregoing analysis suggests the following line of inquiry in cases of penal negligence. 
        - The **first** question is whether *actus reus* is established. This requires that the negligence constitute a marked departure from the standards of the reasonable person in all the circumstances of the case. 
        - The **next** question is whether the *mens rea* is established. The *mens rea* for objective foresight of risking harm is normally inferred from the facts. **The standard is that of the reasonable person in the circumstances of the accused**. 
        - However, the normal inference may be **negated by evidence** raising a reasonable doubt as to **lack of capacity to appreciate the risk**. Thus, if a *prima facie* case for *actus reus* and *mens rea* is made out, it is necessary to ask **a further question**: did the accused possess the requisite **capacity to appreciate the risk** flowing from his conduct? If this further question is answered in the affirmative, the necessary moral fault is established and the accused is properly **convicted**. If not, the accused must be **acquitted**.

    - [7] The **modified objective test** established by this Court’s jurisprudence remains the appropriate test to determine the requisite *mens rea* for negligence-based criminal offences. It does so in two important respects. 
    - **First**, there must be a “**marked departure**” from the civil norm in the circumstances of the case. The distinction between a mere departure and a marked departure from the norm is **a question of degree**. It is only when the conduct meets the higher threshold that the court may find, on the basis of that conduct alone, a blameworthy state of mind. 
    - [8] **Second**, the modified objective test for penal negligence cannot ignore the actual mental state of the accused. Objective *mens rea* is based on the premise that a reasonable person in the accused’s position would have been aware of the risks arising from the conduct. **The fault lies in the absence of the requisite mental state of care**. **However**, where the accused raises **a reasonable doubt** whether a reasonable person in his or her position would have been aware of the risks arising from the conduct, the premise for finding objective fault is no longer sound and there must be an acquittal. 
    - I would therefore **restate** the **[modified objective] test** reproduced above as follows:
        - (a) The *Actus Reus*: The trier of fact must be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that, **viewed objectively**, the accused was, in the words of the section, driving in a manner that was “dangerous to the public, having regard to all the circumstances, including the nature, condition and use of the place at which the motor vehicle is being operated and the amount of traffic that at the time is or might reasonably be expected to be at that place.”
        - (b) The *Mens Rea*: The trier of fact must also be satisfied beyond a reasonable doubt that the accused’s objectively dangerous conduct was **accompanied by the required *mens rea***. In making the objective assessment, the trier of fact should be satisfied on the basis of all the evidence, including evidence about the accused’s actual state of mind, if any, that the conduct amounted to a **marked departure** from the standard of care that **a reasonable person would observe in the accused’s circumstances**. 
    - [49] If the conduct does not constitute a marked departure from the standard expected of a reasonably prudent driver, **there is no need to pursue the analysis**. The offence will not have been made out.

    - [36] The focus of the *mens rea* analysis is on whether the dangerous manner of driving was the result of **a marked departure from the standard of care** which a reasonable person would have exercised in the same circumstances (***Beatty***, at para. 48). It is helpful to approach the issue by asking two questions. 
        - The **first** is whether, in light of all the relevant evidence, a reasonable person would have foreseen the risk and taken steps to avoid it if possible. 
        - If so, the **second** question is whether the accused’s failure to foresee the risk and take steps to avoid it, if possible, was a marked departure from the standard of care expected of a reasonable person in the accused’s circumstances.
