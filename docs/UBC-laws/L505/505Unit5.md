# The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms

The adoption of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* in 1982 marked an important change in Canadian constitutional law. The *Charter* is a constitutional document that applies to both levels of government, and sets out important individual rights and freedoms that must be protected from the actions of both federal and provincial legislatures.

## 5.1 Introduction to the Charter

The common law has been protecting two categories of individual rights: **political rights**, which include rights of participation, representation, and voting, and **civil rights**, which include freedoms of the person, speech, religion, and property. 

The rule of law has, at its core, three tenets: that there must be a positive order of laws, that individuals and the state are bound equally by the law, and that civil and political rights are protected by common law courts rather than by a written constitution.

    - Two features have characterized the political institutions of England. The first was royal supremacy, but has now passed into **sovereignty of Parliament**; the second is **rule of law**. 
    - The rule of law has three conceptions.
    - **First**, no man is punishable or can be lawfully made to suffer in body or goods except for a distinct breach of law established in the ordinary legal manner before the ordinary Courts of the land.
    - **Second**, no man is above the law, ... the idea of legal equality, or of the universal subjection of all classes to one law administered by the ordinary Courts.
    - **Third**, general principles of the constitution are with us the result of judicial decisions determining the rights of private persons in particular cases brought before the Courts.

**RIGHTS AND FEDERALISM**

Structurally, federalism provides one way of protecting rights by separating groups that might otherwise clash if combined in the same state.

Supreme Court of Canada’s statement in the ***Reference re Secession of Quebec***, [1998 CanLII 793 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fqr3){:target=" \_blank"} at para 81 that “[a]lthough Canada’s record of upholding the rights of minorities is not a spotless one, that goal is one towards which Canadians have been striving since Confederation, and the pro-cess has not been without successes.” 

Two external influences seem clear in the Bill’s development. The **first** was international rights instruments, especially the *Universal Declaration of Human Rights* adopted by the United Nations in 1948. The **second** was the American *Bill of Rights* and the liberal interpretations of rights by the Supreme Court from the mid-1950s onward, especially in ***Brown v Board of Education***, [347 US 483, 74 S Ct 686 (1954)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/347/483/){:target=" \_blank"}, a landmark decision about school desegregation.

Within Canada, an important factor was probably the fears about regulation by legislatures and administrative agencies, which had expanded greatly during the war.

The question of whether the Charter applies to a particular action or omission is addressed by s. 32(1), which says:

> (a) [This *Charter* applies] to the Parliament and government of Canada in respect of all matters within the authority of Parliament including all matters relating to the Yukon Territory and Northwest Territories; and
(b) to the legislature and government of each province in respect of all matters within the authority of the legislature of each province.

Debates about the scope of the Charter's application relate to a number of important issues, including: 

- whether private actors as well as governments are bound by the Charter; 
- how to define the boundary between government and non-government action; and 
- the role of the courts themselves in relation to the obligations set out in the *Charter*.

#### <p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">Textbook Summary</p>

**Chapter 18: Application**

The Supreme Court of Canada in ***RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd.***, [1986 CanLII 5 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1ftpc){:target=" \_blank"} held that the Charter applies only to government action. 

While the rule that the Charter only applies to state action seems simple enough, it turns out that distinguishing between state and private action is often anything but simple.

There are two significant stress points in the **government action doctrine**: 

- the Court has also said that when an institution, such as a hospital, is **implementing a specific government program**, such as the delivery of health care, its actions related to that program constitute government action subject to the Charter.
    - what kind or degree of power delegation is sufficient to turn a private actor into a reviewable state actor? the Canadian courts have **shied away from a public function test**. 
    - the Supreme Court has said that the key question is ... but whether the institution is **effectively under the direction of government** (***McKinney v. University of Guelph***, [1990 CanLII 60 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fsqk){:target=" \_blank"}). When a private entity is **implementing a specific government policy or program**, its implementation decisions will be subject to the Charter.
- The second issue concerns the state’s responsibility for wrongs committed by private actors.

In ***Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority v. Canadian Federation of Students — British Columbia Component***, [2009 SCC 31](https://canlii.ca/t/24cnk){:target=" \_blank"}, **Deschamps J**, summarized the existing law on the application of the *Charter*:

[16] ... [T]here are two ways to determine whether the Charter applies to an entity’s activities: by enquiring into **the nature of the entity** or by enquiring into **the nature of the activities**. If the entity is found to be “government” either because of its very nature or because the government exercises significant control over it, all of its activities will be subject to the Charter. If the entity is not itself a government entity but nevertheless performs governmental activities, only those activities which can be said to be governmental in nature will be subject to the Charter.

    - Whether universities could be said to be government actors under s 32 of the Charter? The Court concluded that the **universities were not government actors**, and, in the absence of government participation or compulsion, their adoption of mandatory retirement policies did not amount to government action.
    - But the mere fact that an entity is a creature of statute and has been given the legal attributes of a natural person is in no way sufficient to make its actions subject to the *Charter*.
    - Though the universities, like other private organizations, are subject to government regulations and in large measure depend on government funds, they manage their own affairs and allocate these funds, as well as those from tuition, endowment funds and other sources. ... **The legal autonomy of the universities is fully buttressed by their traditional position in society**. Any attempt by government to influence university decisions, especially decisions regarding appointment, tenure and dismissal of academic staff, would be strenuously resisted by the universities on the basis that this could lead to breaches of academic freedom.
    - **Justice Wilson** then set out three tests to help identify the kinds of bodies that ought to be constrained by the *Charter*: 
        - (1) the **“control” test**, which asks whether the legislative, executive, or administrative branch of government exercises general control over the entity in question; 
        - (2) the **“government function” test**, which asks whether the entity performs a traditional government function or a function that in more modern times is recognized as the responsibility of government; and 
        - (3) the **“statutory authority and public interest” test**, which asks whether the entity is one that acts pursuant to statutory authority specifically granted to it to enable it to further an objective that government seeks to promote in the broader public interest.
