# The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms

The adoption of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* in 1982 marked an important change in Canadian constitutional law. The *Charter* is a constitutional document that applies to both levels of government, and sets out important individual rights and freedoms that must be protected from the actions of both federal and provincial legislatures.

## 5.1 Introduction to the Charter

#### <p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">Textbook Summary</p>

The common law has been protecting two categories of individual rights: **political rights**, which include rights of participation, representation, and voting, and **civil rights**, which include freedoms of the person, speech, religion, and property. 

The rule of law has, at its core, three tenets: that there must be a positive order of laws, that individuals and the state are bound equally by the law, and that civil and political rights are protected by common law courts rather than by a written constitution.

    - Two features have characterized the political institutions of England. The first was royal supremacy, but has now passed into **sovereignty of Parliament**; the second is **rule of law**. 
    - The rule of law has three conceptions.
    - **First**, no man is punishable or can be lawfully made to suffer in body or goods except for a distinct breach of law established in the ordinary legal manner before the ordinary Courts of the land.
    - **Second**, no man is above the law, ... the idea of legal equality, or of the universal subjection of all classes to one law administered by the ordinary Courts.
    - **Third**, general principles of the constitution are with us the result of judicial decisions determining the rights of private persons in particular cases brought before the Courts.

**RIGHTS AND FEDERALISM**

Structurally, federalism provides one way of protecting rights by separating groups that might otherwise clash if combined in the same state.

Supreme Court of Canada’s statement in the ***Reference re Secession of Quebec***, [1998 CanLII 793 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fqr3){:target=" \_blank"} at para 81 that “[a]lthough Canada’s record of upholding the rights of minorities is not a spotless one, that goal is one towards which Canadians have been striving since Confederation, and the pro-cess has not been without successes.” 

Two external influences seem clear in the Bill’s development. The **first** was international rights instruments, especially the *Universal Declaration of Human Rights* adopted by the United Nations in 1948. The **second** was the American *Bill of Rights* and the liberal interpretations of rights by the Supreme Court from the mid-1950s onward, especially in ***Brown v Board of Education***, [347 US 483, 74 S Ct 686 (1954)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/347/483/){:target=" \_blank"}, a landmark decision about school desegregation.

Within Canada, an important factor was probably the fears about regulation by legislatures and administrative agencies, which had expanded greatly during the war.

## 5.2 Application

    - Constitutional Law: Chapter 18 (pp. 781-801), 
    - Cases covered:
        - ***McKinney v University of Guelph*** 
        - ***Godbout v Longueuil (City)*** 
        - ***Eldridge v British Columbia*** 

#### <p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">Module Content</p>

The question of whether the Charter applies to a particular action or omission is addressed by s. 32(1), which says:

> (a) [This *Charter* applies] to the Parliament and government of Canada in respect of all matters within the authority of Parliament including all matters relating to the Yukon Territory and Northwest Territories; and
(b) to the legislature and government of each province in respect of all matters within the authority of the legislature of each province.

Debates about the scope of the Charter's application relate to a number of important issues, including: 

- whether private actors as well as governments are bound by the Charter; 
- how to define the boundary between government and non-government action; and 
- the role of the courts themselves in relation to the obligations set out in the *Charter*.

#### <p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">Textbook Summary</p>

**Chapter 18: Application**

The Supreme Court of Canada in ***RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd.***, [1986 CanLII 5 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1ftpc){:target=" \_blank"} held that the Charter applies only to government action. 

While the rule that the Charter only applies to state action seems simple enough, it turns out that distinguishing between state and private action is often anything but simple.

There are two significant stress points in the **government action doctrine**: 

- the Court has also said that when an institution, such as a hospital, is **implementing a specific government program**, such as the delivery of health care, its actions related to that program constitute government action subject to the Charter.
    - what kind or degree of power delegation is sufficient to turn a private actor into a reviewable state actor? the Canadian courts have **shied away from a public function test**. 
    - the Supreme Court has said that the key question is ... but whether the institution is **effectively under the direction of government** (***McKinney v. University of Guelph***, [1990 CanLII 60 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fsqk){:target=" \_blank"}). When a private entity is **implementing a specific government policy or program**, its implementation decisions will be subject to the Charter.
- The second issue concerns the state’s responsibility for wrongs committed by private actors.

In ***Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority v. Canadian Federation of Students — British Columbia Component***, [2009 SCC 31](https://canlii.ca/t/24cnk){:target=" \_blank"}, **Deschamps J**, summarized the existing law on the application of the *Charter*:

[16] ... [T]here are two ways to determine whether the Charter applies to an entity’s activities: by enquiring into **the nature of the entity** or by enquiring into **the nature of the activities**. If the entity is found to be “government” either because of its very nature or because the government exercises significant control over it, all of its activities will be subject to the Charter. If the entity is not itself a government entity but nevertheless performs governmental activities, only those activities which can be said to be governmental in nature will be subject to the Charter.

!!! info "*McKinney v. University of Guelph*, [1990 CanLII 60 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fsqk){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - Whether universities could be said to be government actors under s 32 of the Charter? The Court concluded that the **universities were not government actors**, and, in the absence of government participation or compulsion, their adoption of mandatory retirement policies did not amount to government action.
    - But the mere fact that an entity is a creature of statute and has been given the legal attributes of a natural person is in no way sufficient to make its actions subject to the *Charter*.
    - Though the universities, like other private organizations, are subject to government regulations and in large measure depend on government funds, they manage their own affairs and allocate these funds, as well as those from tuition, endowment funds and other sources. ... **The legal autonomy of the universities is fully buttressed by their traditional position in society**. Any attempt by government to influence university decisions, especially decisions regarding appointment, tenure and dismissal of academic staff, would be strenuously resisted by the universities on the basis that this could lead to breaches of academic freedom.
    - **Justice Wilson** then set out three tests to help identify the kinds of bodies that ought to be constrained by the *Charter*: 
        - (1) the **“control” test**, which asks whether the legislative, executive, or administrative branch of government exercises general control over the entity in question; 
        - (2) the **“government function” test**, which asks whether the entity performs a traditional government function or a function that in more modern times is recognized as the responsibility of government; and 
        - (3) the **“statutory authority and public interest” test**, which asks whether the entity is one that acts pursuant to statutory authority specifically granted to it to enable it to further an objective that government seeks to promote in the broader public interest.

In ***Douglas/kwantlen Faculty Assn. v. Douglas College***, [1990 CanLII 63 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fsqr){:target=" \_blank"}, which involved a **community college** ...The Court was unanimous in concluding that the *Charter* applied to the actions of the college in the negotiation and administration of the collective agreement between itself and the association representing the teachers and librarians at the college.

In ***Lavigne v. Ontario Public Service Employees Union***, [1991 CanLII 68 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fsjw){:target=" \_blank"}, **Justice La Forest** rejected the submission that the *Charter* should apply only to the regulatory activities of government, leaving its commercial or contractual activities exempt. Contemporary governments may pursue policies by engaging in **commercial activities** and should **not be exempt** from the *Charter* when they do so.

The Supreme Court of Canada has **not** yet ruled on the issue of whether **public schools** are subject to the *Charter*. The Court assumed, without deciding, that public schools “constitute part of government” (***R. v. M. (M.R.)***, [1998 CanLII 770 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fqq9){:target=" \_blank"}, at para 25).

An issue that still remains unsettled is whether Crown corporations (such as **Canada Post**) are subject to the Charter. Several lower courts had expressed the view that while some aspects of **Canada Post**’s operations might be subject to the *Charter*, the collective bargaining relationship between it and its union was not. A number of decisions have found that the *Charter* does not apply to the **Canadian Broadcasting Corporation**.


<p class="highlight blue" markdown="1">Even if an entity is not part of the apparatus of either the federal or provincial government, because it is not subject to routine or regular ministerial control, it may nevertheless qualify as government for the purposes of s 32 of the *Charter* if it is exercising governmental functions.</p>

!!! info "*Godbout v. Longueuil (City)*, [1997 CanLII 335 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fqxp){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - [47] ... [Where] entities other than Parliament, the provincial legislatures or the federal or provincial governments ... are, in reality, “governmental” in nature,as evidenced by such things as the degree of government control exercised over them, or by the governmental quality of the functions they perform, they cannot escape *Charter* scrutiny. ... Indeed, it may be that particular entities will be subject to *Charter* scrutiny **in respect of certain governmental activities they perform**, even if the entities themselves cannot accurately be described as “governmental” *per se*.
    - [48] The possibility that the Canadian *Charter* might apply to entities other than Parliament, the provincial legislatures and the federal or provincial governments is, of course, explicitly contemplated by the language of s. 32(1) inasmuch as entities that are **controlled by government** or that **perform truly governmental functions** are themselves “matters within the authority” of the particular legislative body that created them.
    - [49] In order for the Canadian *Charter* to apply ... , an entity must truly be acting in what can accurately be described as a “governmental”, as opposed to a merely “public”, capacity.
    - [50] ... the view that **municipalities** are subject to the *Charter* is not only sound, but also wholly consistent with the case law I have been discussing.
    - [55] All the municipality’s powers are derived from statute and all are of a governmental character. An act performed by an entity that is governmental in nature is, to my mind, necessarily “governmental” and cannot properly be viewed as “private” at all.

In ***Kahkewistahaw First Nation v Taypotat***, [2015 SCC 30](https://canlii.ca/t/gj637){:target=" \_blank"}, the Supreme Court of Canada assumed that First Nations’ **band councils** established under the *Indian Act* were government entities subject to the *Charter*. The terms of a treaty may also subject the exercise of **Indigenous governmental powers** to *Charter* constraints.

The application of the *Charter* to **law society** rules was assumed without discussion by the Supreme Court in ***Black v. Law Society of Alberta***, [1989 CanLII 132 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1ft80){:target=" \_blank"}.

In ***Blencoe v British Columbia (Human Rights Commission)***, [2000 SCC 44](https://canlii.ca/t/525t){:target=" \_blank"}, the Supreme Court of Canada found that the Ontario Human Rights Commission, although not part of government and not controlled by government, was subject to the *Charter* because it was a body created by statute to implement a government objective and all of its actions were pursuant to statutory authority.

<p class="highlight blue" markdown="1">Non-Governmental Entities Implementing Government Programs</p>

!!! info "*Eldridge v. British Columbia (Attorney General)*, [1997 CanLII 327 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fqx5){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - [19] Whether the *Charter* applies to those particular entities, like hospitals and the Medical Services Commission, exercising discretion conferred by legislation. In my view, the *Charter* applies to [them] in so far as they act pursuant to the powers granted to them by the statutes.
    - [20] There are two ways, however, in which it can do so [the *Charter* applies]. **First**, legislation may be found to be unconstitutional on its face because it violates a *Charter* right and is not saved by s. 1. **Secondly**, the *Charter* may be infringed, not by the legislation itself, but by the actions of a delegated decision-maker in applying it.
    - [36] There are myriad public or quasi-public institutions that may be independent from government in some respects, but in other respects may exercise delegated governmental powers or be otherwise responsible for the implementation of government policy. ... it must be established that the entity, in performing that particular action, is part of “government” within the meaning of s. 32 of the Charter.
    - [40] ... when an entity is determined to be part of the fabric of government, the *Charter* will apply to **all its activities**, including those that might in other circumstances be thought of as “private.” 
    - [41] ... the *Charter* may apply to non-governmental entities in certain circumstances ... It has been suggested, for example, that the *Charter* will apply to a private entity when engaged in activities that can in some way be attributed to government. 
    - [42] ***McKinney*** makes it clear, however, that the *Charter* applies to private entities in so far as they act in furtherance of a specific governmental program or policy.
    - [43] Two important points must be made with respect to this principle. First, the mere fact that an entity performs what may loosely be termed a “**public function**,” or the fact that a particular activity may be described as “public” in nature, will **not be sufficient** to bring it within the purview of “government” for the purposes of s. 32 of the *Charter*. In order for the *Charter* to apply to a private entity, it must be found to be implementing a specific governmental policy or program.

More recently, the Alberta Court of Appeal in ***UAlberta Pro-Life v Governors of the University of Alberta***, [2020 ABCA 1 (CanLII)](https://canlii.ca/t/j4c8s){:target=" \_blank"}, held that the university’s regulation of student expression on campus amounted to government action **subject to** the *Charter* because the university’s purpose, established by statute, was to educate students and this was achieved “largely by means of free expression” (at para 148).

## 5.3 Interpreting Rights and Defining Limitations

<p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">**Module Content**</p>

Section 1 of the *Charter of Rights and Freedoms* is as follows:

> The Canadian *Charter of Rights and Freedoms* guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it **subject only to** such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.

This section creates a two-step process for the adjudication of Charter claims.

- First, it is necessary to determine whether a Charter right has been breached by a state act.  At this stage, the burden of proof lies with the **claimant**, who must establish that her or his right has been breached.  
- Second, the court must determine whether the limit on the Charter right is "reasonable, prescribed by law, and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society."  Here, the burden of proof lies with the **state** seeking to uphold the constitutionality of the impugned state action.

Notice that section 1 of the Charter reflects a **tension** between a civil libertarian view in which individual freedoms are paramount, and a social democratic perspective in which it may be appropriate or necessary to infringe on individual rights in order to advance the collective goals of the community.

The Supreme Court of Canada first provided a framework for understanding s. 1 of the Charter in a case called ***Oakes***. Although section 1 jurisprudence has changed over the years, this case remains the
touchstone for structuring the analysis – and this framework is often called the “**Oakes test**.”

Some broader issues that you will need to consider whenever you
are engaging with s. 1 of the Charter.

- First, note that the task of negotiating the boundary between individual rights and collective goods is an inherently **political** one. When reading judgements on s. 1, consider to what extent courts are engaging in balancing competing societal interests, as well as how explicit they are about this exercise.
- Second, and closely related, is the idea that s. 1 jurisprudence deals quite directly with questions about the appropriate **division** of tasks between legislative and judicial branches of government in a democratic society. Consider how well courts and legislatures are equipped to deal with what **Prof. Choudhry** describes as the inevitability of policy making under conditions of factual uncertainty.
- Finally, and following from this, think about how the Supreme Court of Canada has framed s. 1 in relation to questions about evidence. Do you think that s. 1 is primarily about “facts”? What kind of “evidence” can or should a court require to determine whether or not the infringement of a right is justified? Is there a legitimate role for “common sense” in this analysis?
