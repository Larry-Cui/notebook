# The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms

The adoption of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* in 1982 marked an important change in Canadian constitutional law. The *Charter* is a constitutional document that applies to both levels of government, and sets out important individual rights and freedoms that must be protected from the actions of both federal and provincial legislatures.

## 5.1 Introduction to the Charter

#### <p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">Textbook Summary</p>

The common law has been protecting two categories of individual rights: **political rights**, which include rights of participation, representation, and voting, and **civil rights**, which include freedoms of the person, speech, religion, and property. 

The rule of law has, at its core, three tenets: that there must be a positive order of laws, that individuals and the state are bound equally by the law, and that civil and political rights are protected by common law courts rather than by a written constitution. 

!!! info "Albert V Dicey, *Introduction to the Study of the Law of the Constitution*"

    - Two features have characterized the political institutions of England. The first was royal supremacy, but has now passed into **sovereignty of Parliament**; the second is **rule of law**. 
    - The rule of law has three conceptions.
    - **First**, no man is punishable or can be lawfully made to suffer in body or goods except for a distinct breach of law established in the ordinary legal manner before the ordinary Courts of the land.
    - **Second**, no man is above the law, ... the idea of legal equality, or of the universal subjection of all classes to one law administered by the ordinary Courts.
    - **Third**, general principles of the constitution are with us the result of judicial decisions determining the rights of private persons in particular cases brought before the Courts.

**RIGHTS AND FEDERALISM**

Structurally, federalism provides one way of protecting rights by separating groups that might otherwise clash if combined in the same state.

Supreme Court of Canada’s statement in the ***Reference re Secession of Quebec***, [1998 CanLII 793 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fqr3){:target=" \_blank"} at para 81 that “[a]lthough Canada’s record of upholding the rights of minorities is not a spotless one, that goal is one towards which Canadians have been striving since Confederation, and the pro-cess has not been without successes.” 

Two external influences seem clear in the Bill’s development. The **first** was international rights instruments, especially the *Universal Declaration of Human Rights* adopted by the United Nations in 1948. The **second** was the American *Bill of Rights* and the liberal interpretations of rights by the Supreme Court from the mid-1950s onward, especially in ***Brown v Board of Education***, [347 US 483, 74 S Ct 686 (1954)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/347/483/){:target=" \_blank"}, a landmark decision about school desegregation.

Within Canada, an important factor was probably the fears about regulation by legislatures and administrative agencies, which had expanded greatly during the war.

#### <p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">Module Content</p>

The question of whether the Charter applies to a particular action or omission is addressed by s. 32(1), which says:

> (a) [This *Charter* applies] to the Parliament and government of Canada in respect of all matters within the authority of Parliament including all matters relating to the Yukon Territory and Northwest Territories; and
(b) to the legislature and government of each province in respect of all matters within the authority of the legislature of each province.

Debates about the scope of the Charter's application relate to a number of important issues, including: 

- whether private actors as well as governments are bound by the Charter; 
- how to define the boundary between government and non-government action; and 
- the role of the courts themselves in relation to the obligations set out in the *Charter*.

#### <p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">Textbook Summary</p>

**Chapter 18: Application**

The Supreme Court of Canada in ***RWDSU v. Dolphin Delivery Ltd.***, [1986 CanLII 5 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1ftpc){:target=" \_blank"} held that the Charter applies only to government action. 

While the rule that the Charter only applies to state action seems simple enough, it turns out that distinguishing between state and private action is often anything but simple.

There are two significant stress points in the **government action doctrine**: 

- the Court has also said that when an institution, such as a hospital, is **implementing a specific government program**, such as the delivery of health care, its actions related to that program constitute government action subject to the Charter.
    - what kind or degree of power delegation is sufficient to turn a private actor into a reviewable state actor? the Canadian courts have **shied away from a public function test**. 
    - the Supreme Court has said that the key question is ... but whether the institution is **effectively under the direction of government** (***McKinney v. University of Guelph***, [1990 CanLII 60 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fsqk){:target=" \_blank"}). When a private entity is **implementing a specific government policy or program**, its implementation decisions will be subject to the Charter.
- The second issue concerns the state’s responsibility for wrongs committed by private actors.

In ***Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority v. Canadian Federation of Students — British Columbia Component***, [2009 SCC 31](https://canlii.ca/t/24cnk){:target=" \_blank"}, **Deschamps J**, summarized the existing law on the application of the *Charter*:

[16] ... [T]here are two ways to determine whether the Charter applies to an entity’s activities: by enquiring into **the nature of the entity** or by enquiring into **the nature of the activities**. If the entity is found to be “government” either because of its very nature or because the government exercises significant control over it, all of its activities will be subject to the Charter. If the entity is not itself a government entity but nevertheless performs governmental activities, only those activities which can be said to be governmental in nature will be subject to the Charter.

!!! info "*McKinney v. University of Guelph*, [1990 CanLII 60 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fsqk){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - Whether universities could be said to be government actors under s 32 of the Charter? The Court concluded that the **universities were not government actors**, and, in the absence of government participation or compulsion, their adoption of mandatory retirement policies did not amount to government action.
    - But the mere fact that an entity is a creature of statute and has been given the legal attributes of a natural person is in no way sufficient to make its actions subject to the *Charter*.
    - Though the universities, like other private organizations, are subject to government regulations and in large measure depend on government funds, they manage their own affairs and allocate these funds, as well as those from tuition, endowment funds and other sources. ... **The legal autonomy of the universities is fully buttressed by their traditional position in society**. Any attempt by government to influence university decisions, especially decisions regarding appointment, tenure and dismissal of academic staff, would be strenuously resisted by the universities on the basis that this could lead to breaches of academic freedom.
    - **Justice Wilson** then set out three tests to help identify the kinds of bodies that ought to be constrained by the *Charter*: 
        - (1) the **“control” test**, which asks whether the legislative, executive, or administrative branch of government exercises general control over the entity in question; 
        - (2) the **“government function” test**, which asks whether the entity performs a traditional government function or a function that in more modern times is recognized as the responsibility of government; and 
        - (3) the **“statutory authority and public interest” test**, which asks whether the entity is one that acts pursuant to statutory authority specifically granted to it to enable it to further an objective that government seeks to promote in the broader public interest.

In ***Douglas/kwantlen Faculty Assn. v. Douglas College***, [1990 CanLII 63 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fsqr){:target=" \_blank"}, which involved a **community college** ...The Court was unanimous in concluding that the *Charter* applied to the actions of the college in the negotiation and administration of the collective agreement between itself and the association representing the teachers and librarians at the college.

In ***Lavigne v. Ontario Public Service Employees Union***, [1991 CanLII 68 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fsjw){:target=" \_blank"}, **Justice La Forest** rejected the submission that the *Charter* should apply only to the regulatory activities of government, leaving its commercial or contractual activities exempt. Contemporary governments may pursue policies by engaging in **commercial activities** and should **not be exempt** from the *Charter* when they do so.

The Supreme Court of Canada has **not** yet ruled on the issue of whether **public schools** are subject to the *Charter*. The Court assumed, without deciding, that public schools “constitute part of government” (***R. v. M. (M.R.)***, [1998 CanLII 770 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fqq9){:target=" \_blank"}, at para 25).

An issue that still remains unsettled is whether Crown corporations (such as **Canada Post**) are subject to the Charter. Several lower courts had expressed the view that while some aspects of **Canada Post**’s operations might be subject to the *Charter*, the collective bargaining relationship between it and its union was not. A number of decisions have found that the *Charter* does not apply to the **Canadian Broadcasting Corporation**.


<p class="highlight blue" markdown="1">Even if an entity is not part of the apparatus of either the federal or provincial government, because it is not subject to routine or regular ministerial control, it may nevertheless qualify as government for the purposes of s 32 of the *Charter* if it is exercising governmental functions.</p>

    - [47] ... [Where] entities other than Parliament, the provincial legislatures or the federal or provincial governments ... are, in reality, “governmental” in nature,as evidenced by such things as the degree of government control exercised over them, or by the governmental quality of the functions they perform, they cannot escape *Charter* scrutiny. ... Indeed, it may be that particular entities will be subject to *Charter* scrutiny **in respect of certain governmental activities they perform**, even if the entities themselves cannot accurately be described as “governmental” *per se*.
    - [48] The possibility that the Canadian *Charter* might apply to entities other than Parliament, the provincial legislatures and the federal or provincial governments is, of course, explicitly contemplated by the language of s. 32(1) inasmuch as entities that are **controlled by government** or that **perform truly governmental functions** are themselves “matters within the authority” of the particular legislative body that created them.
    - [49] In order for the Canadian *Charter* to apply ... , an entity must truly be acting in what can accurately be described as a “governmental”, as opposed to a merely “public”, capacity.
    - [50] ... the view that **municipalities** are subject to the *Charter* is not only sound, but also wholly consistent with the case law I have been discussing.
    - [55] All the municipality’s powers are derived from statute and all are of a governmental character. An act performed by an entity that is governmental in nature is, to my mind, necessarily “governmental” and cannot properly be viewed as “private” at all.

In ***Kahkewistahaw First Nation v Taypotat***, [2015 SCC 30](https://canlii.ca/t/gj637){:target=" \_blank"}, the Supreme Court of Canada assumed that First Nations’ **band councils** established under the *Indian Act* were government entities subject to the *Charter*. The terms of a treaty may also subject the exercise of **Indigenous governmental powers** to *Charter* constraints.

The application of the *Charter* to **law society** rules was assumed without discussion by the Supreme Court in ***Black v. Law Society of Alberta***, [1989 CanLII 132 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1ft80){:target=" \_blank"}.

In ***Blencoe v British Columbia (Human Rights Commission)***, [2000 SCC 44](https://canlii.ca/t/525t){:target=" \_blank"}, the Supreme Court of Canada found that the Ontario Human Rights Commission, although not part of government and not controlled by government, was subject to the *Charter* because it was a body created by statute to implement a government objective and all of its actions were pursuant to statutory authority.

    - [19] Whether the *Charter* applies to those particular entities, like hospitals and the Medical Services Commission, exercising discretion conferred by legislation. In my view, the *Charter* applies to [them] in so far as they act pursuant to the powers granted to them by the statutes.
    - [20] There are two ways, however, in which it can do so [the *Charter* applies]. **First**, legislation may be found to be unconstitutional on its face because it violates a *Charter* right and is not saved by s. 1. **Secondly**, the *Charter* may be infringed, not by the legislation itself, but by the actions of a delegated decision-maker in applying it.
    - [36] There are myriad public or quasi-public institutions that may be independent from government in some respects, but in other respects may exercise delegated governmental powers or be otherwise responsible for the implementation of government policy. ... it must be established that the entity, in performing that particular action, is part of “government” within the meaning of s. 32 of the Charter.
    - [40] ... when an entity is determined to be part of the fabric of government, the *Charter* will apply to **all its activities**, including those that might in other circumstances be thought of as “private.” 
    - [41] ... the *Charter* may apply to non-governmental entities in certain circumstances ... It has been suggested, for example, that the *Charter* will apply to a private entity when engaged in activities that can in some way be attributed to government. 
    - [42] ***McKinney*** makes it clear, however, that the *Charter* applies to private entities in so far as they act in furtherance of a specific governmental program or policy.
    - [43] Two important points must be made with respect to this principle. First, the mere fact that an entity performs what may loosely be termed a “**public function**,” or the fact that a particular activity may be described as “public” in nature, will **not be sufficient** to bring it within the purview of “government” for the purposes of s. 32 of the *Charter*. In order for the *Charter* to apply to a private entity, it must be found to be implementing a specific governmental policy or program.

More recently, the Alberta Court of Appeal in ***UAlberta Pro-Life v Governors of the University of Alberta***, [2020 ABCA 1 (CanLII)](https://canlii.ca/t/j4c8s){:target=" \_blank"}, held that the university’s regulation of student expression on campus amounted to government action **subject to** the *Charter* because the university’s purpose, established by statute, was to educate students and this was achieved “largely by means of free expression” (at para 148).

## 5.3 Interpreting Rights and Defining Limitations

#### <p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">**Module Content**</p>

Section 1 of the *Charter of Rights and Freedoms* is as follows:

> The Canadian *Charter of Rights and Freedoms* guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in it **subject only to** such reasonable limits prescribed by law as can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.

This section creates a two-step process for the adjudication of Charter claims.

- First, it is necessary to determine whether a Charter right has been breached by a state act.  At this stage, the burden of proof lies with the **claimant**, who must establish that her or his right has been breached.  
- Second, the court must determine whether the limit on the Charter right is "reasonable, prescribed by law, and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society."  Here, the burden of proof lies with the **state** seeking to uphold the constitutionality of the impugned state action.

Notice that section 1 of the Charter reflects a **tension** between a civil libertarian view in which individual freedoms are paramount, and a social democratic perspective in which it may be appropriate or necessary to infringe on individual rights in order to advance the collective goals of the community.

The Supreme Court of Canada first provided a framework for understanding s. 1 of the Charter in a case called ***Oakes***. Although section 1 jurisprudence has changed over the years, this case remains the
touchstone for structuring the analysis – and this framework is often called the “**Oakes test**.”

Some broader issues that you will need to consider whenever you
are engaging with s. 1 of the Charter.

- First, note that the task of negotiating the boundary between individual rights and collective goods is an inherently **political** one. When reading judgements on s. 1, consider to what extent courts are engaging in balancing competing societal interests, as well as how explicit they are about this exercise.
- Second, and closely related, is the idea that s. 1 jurisprudence deals quite directly with questions about the appropriate **division** of tasks between legislative and judicial branches of government in a democratic society. Consider how well courts and legislatures are equipped to deal with what **Prof. Choudhry** describes as the inevitability of policy making under conditions of factual uncertainty.
- Finally, and following from this, think about how the Supreme Court of Canada has framed s. 1 in relation to questions about evidence. Do you think that s. 1 is primarily about “facts”? What kind of “evidence” can or should a court require to determine whether or not the infringement of a right is justified? Is there a legitimate role for “common sense” in this analysis?

#### <p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">**Textbook Summary**</p>

**Chapter 17 THE FRAMEWORK OF THE CHARTER**

The *Charter* establishes a two-step process for the adjudication of rights claims where a law is being challenged. The **first** step is concerned with whether a Charter right has been limited. This **second** step is concerned with the justification of limits on Charter rights.

The courts have adopted a **“purposive” approach** to the interpretation of *Charter* rights.

!!! info "***Hunter et al. v. Southam Inc.***, [1984 CanLII 33 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1mgc1){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - The need for a broad perspective in approaching constitutional documents is a familiar theme in Canadian constitutional jurisprudence. In ***Edwards v. Canada (Attorney General)***, [1929 CanLII 438 (UK JCPC)](https://canlii.ca/t/gbvs4){:target=" \_blank"}:
        - The *British North America Act* planted in Canada a living tree capable of growth and expansion within its natural limits. ... to give it a large and liberal interpretation. 
    - The *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* is a **purposive** document. It is intended to **constrain** governmental action inconsistent with those rights and freedoms; it is not in itself an **authorization** for governmental action. This leads, in my view, to the further conclusion that an assessment of the constitutionality of a search and seizure, or of a statute author-izing a search or seizure, must **focus on its “reasonable” or “unreasonable” impact** on the subject of the search or the seizure, and **not simply on its rationality** in furthering some valid government objective. 
    - ... it is first necessary to **specify the purpose underlying** s. 8: in other words, to delineate the nature of the interests it is meant to protect.

In ***R. v. Big M Drug Mart Ltd.***, [1985 CanLII 69 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fv2b){:target=" \_blank"}, Dickson CJ (at paras 116-17) reiterated the Court’s commitment to a purposive approach:

> this Court expressed the view that the proper approach to the definition of the rights and freedoms guaranteed by the *Charter* was a purposive one.
> 
> In my view this analysis is to be undertaken, and the purpose of the right or freedom in question is to be sought **by reference to** the character and the larger objects of the *Charter* itself, to the language chosen to articulate the specific right or freedom, to the historical origins of the concepts enshrined, and where applicable, to the meaning and purpose of the other specific rights and freedoms with which it is associated within the text of the *Charter*. 

The two-step structure of adjudication rests on the idea that there are two **distinct** issues to be addressed, the definition of the right and the justification of limits. The scope of the right is defined in terms of the interests it protects or advances. Any activity that advances the right’s purpose falls within its scope. Other interests that compete or conflict with those that underlie the right may be taken into account under s 1 as possible grounds for limitation. 

Whether the distinction between these different interests really is so straightforward? particularly if the purposive approach is unable to yield a bright line between activity that advances the purpose (and is protected) and activity that does not.

Jamie Cameron points out in the following excerpt of “The McLachlin Court and the Charter in 2012” (2013) 63 SCLR 16 at 39:

> ... now the deep thinking on rights has been done and is in the past, that **balancing rights and limits** is a different exercise. The grand pronouncements give way to fine tuning and subtle interpretation. 
> 
> Deference to the legislatures is more standard when issues do not present conflicts in principle but sit, instead, in the margin of appreciation. Presenting differences of opinion that way may mean that **reasonable limits will typically prevail over rights** protection.

**AIDS TO INTERPRETATION**

* Interpretive Provisions in the *Charter*

The *Charter* includes several general provisions (ss 25 to 29) that do not entrench a particular right, but instead affirm or highlight certain values that are to be taken into account when interpreting the entrenched rights and assessing the justification of limits under s 1.

* Parliamentary and Committee Debates
   
In ***Re B.C. Motor Vehicle Act***, [1985 CanLII 81 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/dln){:target=" \_blank"}, the Court considered the relevance of the **committee and Parliamentary debates** that preceded the enactment of the *Charter* to the interpretation of the entrenched rights:

> [50] The inherent unreliability of such statements and speeches is not altered by the mere fact that they pertain to the *Charter* rather than a statute. 
>
> [52] In view of the indeterminate nature of the data, it would in my view be erroneous to give these materials anything but minimal weight. 

To sum up, though they are admissible, debates or legislative history have **limited weight** in *Charter* interpretation. 

* Canadian Pre-*Charter* Jurisprudence 

In several early *Charter* judgments, the Supreme Court of Canada signalled that decisions under the *Canadian Bill of Rights* had only **limited relevance** in *Charter* cases.

The Supreme Court of Canada’s **first comprehensive treatment** of the meaning of s 1 came in ***R v Oakes***, which remains the primary referent for this second stage of Charter adjudication.

!!! info "*R. v. Oakes*, [1986 CanLII 46 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1ftv6){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - Section 8 of the *Narcotic Control Act*, RSC 1970, c N-1 created a “**rebuttable presumption**” that once the fact of possession of a narcotic had been proven, an intention to traffic would be inferred unless the accused established the absence of such an intention. In ***Oakes***, the accused challenged this “reverse onus” provision, arguing that it violated s 11(d) of the *Charter*. After finding that s 8 did violate s 11(d), the Court went on to discuss whether the limit could nonetheless be upheld under s 1.
    - s. 1 has two functions: **first**, it constitutionally guarantees the rights and freedoms set out in the provisions which follow; and, **second**, it states explicitly the **exclusive justificatory criteria** (outside of s. 33 of the *Constitution Act*, 1982) against which limitations on those rights and freedoms must be measured.
    - The Court must be guided by the **values and principles** essential to a free and democratic society which I believe embody, to name but a few, respect for the inherent **dignity** of the human person, commitment to **social justice and equality**, accommodation of a wide **variety of beliefs**, respect for **cultural and group identity**, and faith in social and political institutions which enhance the **participation** of individuals and groups in society.
    - It may become necessary to limit rights and freedoms in circumstances where their exercise would be inimical to the realization of collective goals of fundamental importance. s. 1 provides criteria of a stringent standard of justification, especially when understood in terms of the **two contextual considerations** discussed above, namely, the **violation** of a constitutionally guaranteed right or freedom and the fundamental **principles** of a free and democratic society. 
    - The **onus** of proving that a limit on a right or freedom guaranteed by the *Charter* is reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society rests **upon the party seeking to uphold the limitation**.
    - The **standard of proof** under s. 1 is the **civil standard**, namely, proof by a prepon-derance of probability. The alternative criminal standard, proof beyond a reasonable doubt, would, in my view, be unduly onerous on the party seeking to limit.
    - To establish that a limit is reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society, two central criteria must be satisfied. 
        - First, the objective, which the measures responsible for a limit on a Charter right or freedom are designed to serve, must be “of **sufficient importance** to warrant overriding a constitutionally protected right or freedom”. It is necessary, at a minimum, that an objective relate to concerns which are **pressing and substantial** in a free and democratic society before it can be characterized as sufficiently important. 
        - Second, the party invoking s. 1 must show that the means chosen are reasonable and demonstrably justified. This involves “a form of **proportionality test**”.
    - There are three important components of **a proportionality test**. 
        - First, the measures adopted must be carefully designed to achieve the objective in question. They must not be arbitrary, unfair or based on irrational considerations. In short, they must be **rationally connected** to the objective. 
        - Second, the means should **impair “as little as possible”** the right or freedom in question.
        - Third, there must be a **proportionality** between the effects of the measures which are responsible for limiting the Charter right or freedom, and the objective which has been identified as of “sufficient importance.” 
    - With respect to the **third component** (proportionality), the inquiry into effects must, however, go further. Some limits on rights and freedoms protected by the Charter will be more serious than others. ... it is still possible that, because of the severity of the deleterious effects of a measure on individuals or groups, the measure will not be justified by the purposes it is intended to serve. The **more severe** the deleterious effects of a measure, the **more important** the objective must be if the measure is to be reasonable and demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.

The **rational connection** and **minimal impairment** tests are closely related. A law that does not rationally advance the pressing and substantial purpose for which it was enacted can be described as unnecessarily restricting the right or freedom. Similarly, a law that restricts the right or freedom more than is necessary to advance its pressing purpose (that does not minimally impair the freedom) can be described as partially ineffective or irrational.

In ***RJR-MacDonald Inc v Canada (AG)***, [1995 CanLII 64(SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1frgz){:target=" \_blank"}, the Court found that when Parliament’s preferred approach falls “within a range of reasonable alternatives,” the minimal impairment test will be satisfied. But if the Court can identify “equally effective” and less intrusive means to achieve the objective, it will rule that the law does not minimally impair the rights or freedoms at stake (at para 160).

The **Final Balance**. This last component of the ***Oakes* test**, which is referred to as the “deleterious effects” test or the “disproportionate effects” test, requires a proportionality between the effects of the measures that are responsible for limiting the Charter right or freedom, and the objective that has been identified as of “sufficient importance.”

In ***Dagenais v. Canadian Broadcasting Corp.***, [1994 CanLII 39 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1frnq){:target=" \_blank"}, the Court added a refinement or clarification to the third part of the Oakes proportionality test.  The ***Dagenais*** refinement requires that in applying this test, courts consider not only the **objective** of the impugned law but also its **salutary effects**.

> I believe that the third step of the second branch of the Oakes test requires **both** that the **underlying objective** of a measure and the **salutary effects** that actually result from its implementation be **proportional to the deleterious effects** the measure has on fundamental rights and freedoms.
>
> Nonetheless, even if the importance of the objective itself (when viewed in the abstract) outweighs the deleterious effects on protected rights, it is still possible that the actual salutary effects of the legislation will not be sufficient to justify these negative effects.

**The Subsequent Development of the Oakes Test: Context and Deference**

Two important and closely related developments since the introduction of the ***Oakes* test**. 

- The first is the emergence of the contextual approach to the assessment of limits under s 1. This approach requires that courts **assess the value or significance of the right** and its restriction in their context rather than in the abstract. 
    - certain forms of expression such as hate promotion are less valuable, than other forms of expression, and that this lesser value is a relevant contextual factor in the balancing of interests under s 1.
- The second trend is the Court’s willingness to **defer** in certain circumstances **to the legislature’s judgment** about the need for, and effectiveness of, a particular limit on a Charter right.

The origins of the “contextual” approach to s 1 lie in ***Edmonton Journal v Alberta (AG)***, immediately below.

!!! info "***Edmonton Journal v. Alberta (Attorney General)***, [1989 CanLII 20 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fszp){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - In her judgment,** Wilson J** described a context-sensitive approach to s. 1 that was later adopted by the entire court.
    - Of the two possible approaches to the Charter’s application one might be described as the **abstract approach** and the other the **contextual approach**. ... which one is adopted may tend to affect the result of the balancing process called for under s. 1.
    - Under each approach it is necessary to ascertain the **underlying value** which the right was designed to protect. This is achieved through a **purposive interpretation** of Charter rights. It is also necessary under each approach to ascertain the **legislative objective** sought to be advanced by the impugned legislation. This is done by ascertaining the **intention** of the legislator in enacting the particular piece of legislation. ... it must then be determined whether the impugned legislation constitutes a **reasonable limit** on the right which can be demonstrably justified in a free and democratic society.
    - One virtue of the contextual approach, it seems to me, is that it recognizes that a particular right or freedom may have a **different value depending on the context**. 
    - It is my view that a right or freedom may have different meanings in different contexts. It is for this reason that I believe that the importance of the right or freedom **must be assessed in context rather than in the abstract** and that its purpose must be ascertained in context. 

the Court seems also to have understood the call for a more contextual approach as requiring **greater flexibility** in the application of each of the steps of the ***Oakes* test** and **greater deference** to legislative judgment (in certain circumstances) when applying the test. The result has been a more deferential, reasonableness-based approach to the various strands in the s 1 analysis in certain contexts. 

***Irwin Toy v Quebec (AG)***, immediately below, may represent the high-water mark of judicial deference.

    - This case involved restrictions on advertising directed at children. the Court set out some of the circumstances in which deference to legislative judgment is appropriate.
    - If the legislature has made a reasonable assessment as to where the line [between the claims of competing groups] is most properly drawn, especially if that assessment involves weighing conflicting scientific evidence and allocating scarce resources on this basis, it is **not for the court to second guess**.
    - The same degree of certainty may not be achievable in cases involving the reconciliation of claims of competing individuals or groups or the distribution of scarce government resources.

***Irwin Toy*** introduced a distinction between those cases in which the government is seeking to mediate the interests of competing groups (where a more **deferential** application of s 1 is appropriate) and those cases in which the government is the singular antagonist of the individual whose right has been infringed (where a more **stringent** application of s 1 is warranted).

The role of deference in the application of the Oakes test:

!!! abstract "Sujit Choudhry, “So What Is the Real Legacy of Oakes? Two Decades of Proportionality Analysis Under the Canadian Charter’s Section 1", (2006) 35:2d SCLR 501"

    - There is a dominant narrative on what the true legacy of Oakes and the retreat from Oakes are. The broader lesson of Oakes is the need to tailor judicial review to the unique context of each case. 
    - in ***RJR-MacDonald Inc v Canada (AG)***, in which the Court struck down a general ban on tobacco advertising, the ***Oakes* test** sets up a process of “reasoned demonstration,” as opposed to simply accepting the say-so of governments. ...[t]he s. 1 inquiry is by its very nature a fact-specific inquiry.” [R]ights can only be justifiably limited in response to concrete, precise and real problems or harms whose existence can be demonstrated to the satisfaction of a court through the normal trial process. 
    - the basic question in these cases is the same: who should bear the risk of empirical uncertainty with respect to government activity that infringes *Charter* rights?
        - One answer would be that in a constitutional, rights-based regime, in which rights are the rule and of presumptive importance, limitations on rights are the exception, governments bear the **onus** of justification in upholding rights-infringing measures, and the state bears the **risk** of empirical uncertainty.
            - As **La Forest J** wrote in his dissenting judgment in ***RJR-MacDonald*** to require governments to bear the risk of empirical uncertainty “could have the effect of virtually para-lyzing the operation of government...
        - another answer would be for the courts to not require governments to adduce much in the way of a factual record at all.
    - The Court has struck a **compromise** between these two extremes. This standard is understood as expecting something less of governments than definitive, scientific proof. But an **absolute lack of evidence is unacceptable**; there must be some **factual basis** for the public policy.

!!! abstract "Kent Roach & David Schneiderman, “Freedom of Expression in Canada”"

    - The Canadian tradition of freedom of expression is usually traced back to the English common law. Yet the common law has not been particularly sympathetic to free speech claimants.
    - The preamble of the *Constitution Act*, 1867 suggested to courts that similar degrees of freedom practically would be available in Canada. The Supreme Court of Canada, on occasion, has been prepared to vindicate freedom of expression rights by denying jurisdiction to provinces to enact laws in regard to speech.
    - The Canadian law of freedom of expression, then, **does not** appear to have very deep roots.
    - With freedom of expression poorly anchored in Canadian constitutional law, section 2(b) might be viewed as having profoundly altered the Canadian constitutional scene.

Numerous explanations have been offered for the importance accorded to **freedom of expression**. Some of the main rationales are reviewed by **McLachlin J** in the following excerpt from her judgment in ***R v Keegstra***.


!!! info "*R. v. Keegstra*, [1990 CanLII 24 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fsr1){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - **Political process rationale:** the freedom is instrumental in promoting the free flow of ideas essential to **political democracy** and the **functioning of democratic institutions**.
        - It is, however, limited. It justifies only a relatively narrow sector of free expression, one much narrower than s. 2(b) of the *Charter* would suggest.
    - **An essential precondition of the search for truth:** freedom of expression is seen as a means of promoting a “**marketplace of ideas**,” in which competing ideas vie for supremacy to the end of attaining the truth.
        - Milton’s ***Areopagitica*** in 1644: *And though all the winds of doctrine were let loose to play upon the earth, so Truth be in the field, we do injuriously by licensing and prohibiting to misdoubt her strength. Let her and Falsehood grapple; who ever knew Truth put to the worse, in a free and open encounter?*
        - it promotes the “marketplace of ideas” and hence a more relevant, **vibrant and progressive society**. It is no coincidence that in societies where freedom of expression is severely restricted truth is often replaced by the coerced propagation of ideas that may have little relevance to the problems which the society actually faces. Nor is it a coincidence that industry, economic development and scientific and artistic creativity may stagnate in such societies. 
    - **Free expression is an end in itself:** freedom of expression is seen as worth preserving for its own **intrinsic value**.
    - **How do these diverse justifications of freedom of expression relate to s. 2(b) of the Charter?** 
        - the **broad wording of s. 2(b)** of the *Charter* is arguably inconsistent with a justification based on a single facet of free expression. This suggests that there is no need to adopt any one definitive justification for freedom of expression. Different justifications for freedom of expression may assume varying degrees of importance in different fact situations. However, each of the above rationales is capable of providing guidance as to the scope and content of s. 2(b).
