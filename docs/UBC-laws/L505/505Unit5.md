# The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms

The adoption of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* in 1982 marked an important change in Canadian constitutional law. The *Charter* is a constitutional document that applies to both levels of government, and sets out important individual rights and freedoms that must be protected from the actions of both federal and provincial legislatures.

## 5.1 Introduction to the Charter

The common law has been protecting two categories of individual rights: **political rights**, which include rights of participation, representation, and voting, and **civil rights**, which include freedoms of the person, speech, religion, and property. 

The rule of law has, at its core, three tenets: that there must be a positive order of laws, that individuals and the state are bound equally by the law, and that civil and political rights are protected by common law courts rather than by a written constitution.

    - Two features have characterized the political institutions of England. The first was royal supremacy, but has now passed into **sovereignty of Parliament**; the second is **rule of law**. 
    - The rule of law has three conceptions.
    - **First**, no man is punishable or can be lawfully made to suffer in body or goods except for a distinct breach of law established in the ordinary legal manner before the ordinary Courts of the land.
    - **Second**, no man is above the law, ... the idea of legal equality, or of the universal subjection of all classes to one law administered by the ordinary Courts.
    - **Third**, general principles of the constitution are with us the result of judicial decisions determining the rights of private persons in particular cases brought before the Courts.

**RIGHTS AND FEDERALISM**

Structurally, federalism provides one way of protecting rights by separating groups that might otherwise clash if combined in the same state.

Supreme Court of Canada’s statement in the ***Reference re Secession of Quebec***, [1998 CanLII 793 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fqr3){:target=" \_blank"} at para 81 that “[a]lthough Canada’s record of upholding the rights of minorities is not a spotless one, that goal is one towards which Canadians have been striving since Confederation, and the pro-cess has not been without successes.” 

Two external influences seem clear in the Bill’s development. The **first** was international rights instruments, especially the *Universal Declaration of Human Rights* adopted by the United Nations in 1948. The **second** was the American *Bill of Rights* and the liberal interpretations of rights by the Supreme Court from the mid-1950s onward, especially in ***Brown v Board of Education***, [347 US 483, 74 S Ct 686 (1954)](https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/347/483/){:target=" \_blank"}, a landmark decision about school desegregation.

Within Canada, an important factor was probably the fears about regulation by legislatures and administrative agencies, which had expanded greatly during the war.

The question of whether the Charter applies to a particular action or omission is addressed by s. 32(1), which says:

> (a) [This *Charter* applies] to the Parliament and government of Canada in respect of all matters within the authority of Parliament including all matters relating to the Yukon Territory and Northwest Territories; and
(b) to the legislature and government of each province in respect of all matters within the authority of the legislature of each province.

Debates about the scope of the Charter's application relate to a number of important issues, including: 

- whether private actors as well as governments are bound by the Charter; 
- how to define the boundary between government and non-government action; and 
- the role of the courts themselves in relation to the obligations set out in the *Charter*.
