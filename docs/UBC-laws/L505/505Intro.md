## Syllabus

### Course Materials

Constitutional Law Group, _Canadian Constitutional Law_, 6th edition, Patrick Macklem & Carissima Mathen, eds. (Toronto: Emond Montgomery Publications, 2022). In reading assignments, this text will be referred to as “Constitutional Law”.

### Methodology

This course will be conducted through a combination of **readings**, **online discussions**, **writing exercises** and **short video lectures**.

The course is divided in to six Units, and each Unit is divided into a number of Topics.

- Unit 1: Introduction
- Unit 2: Components of Canadian Government
- Unit 3: The Constitution of Canada
- Unit 4: Federalism
- Unit 5: The Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms
- Unit 6: Aboriginal Law and the Canadian Constitution

To address each Topic, you will be asked to undertake a number of tasks, including reading, writing and discussing the materials.

### Course evaluation

All students will be subject to the Minimum Grading Requirements set by UBC Law for the LL.M. CL Program: [https://allard.ubc.ca/programs/graduate-programs/master-laws-common-law/curriculum-and-accreditation](https://allard.ubc.ca/programs/graduate-programs/master-laws-common-law/curriculum-and-accreditation){:target=" \_blank"}

There are **FOUR** assessment components:

#### Active & meaningful participation in online discussion forums: **15%**

<div class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">Each Discussion Activity counts toward the overall 15% participation mark.  My general guideline is that students who post an answer to the discussion activity can expect about half a point **(0.5)** to be awarded to them.  More thoughtful answers may attract **0.8** points, and a full and thorough answer **1** point.  Meaningful comments on other students' posts can expect a further **0.2** points.  Each Discussion Activity is therefore an opportunity to earn up to up to 1.2 marks (1.0 for your post, and 0.2 for commenting on another's).

TIP: If you see that an Activity is only out of 1 mark (rather than 1.2), then you are NOT required to comment on another student's post for that one.</div>

<div class="highlight red" markdown="1">Any student found using **ChatGPT** to write their posts, reproducing passages from articles, textbooks or the internet, without proper references (plagiarism), will receive a "negative -5" for that Discussion Activity.  This may be in addition to consequences imposed through the University (see Academic Integrity below).</div>

#### Midterm Examination: **35% (1.5 hours)**

The Midterm Examination will be held online using Proctorio Software. Try the Proctorio Practice Examination in advance of the midterm to ensure that you have it installed properly. The link to the midterm will be on our course homepage under "Quizzes".

The midterm may consist of short answer questions, short essay questions, and/or multiple choice questions.

The exam is **limited open-book.** Students may open one electronic PDF document containing class notes. Your notes may include passages from the text or from a case, up to 200 words in length. Note that Proctorio will not allow you to copy and paste from your notes into the exam. Students are not permitted to access any other electronic sources during the exam, including the course website, internet websites, a second notes document, or digital textbooks. **Unlimited hard copy notes are also allowed, but NOT hardcopy textbooks.**

The Midterm will cover material **up to and including the end of Unit 4**.

#### Final Examination: 50% (2.5 hours)

At the end of the course, there will be an **limited open book** examination written online using the Proctorio software platform. As with the Midterm, students may open one electronic PDF document containing class notes. Your notes may include passages from the text or from a case, up to 200 words in length. Note that Proctorio will not allow you to copy and paste from your notes into the exam. Students are not permitted to access any other electronic sources during the exam, including the course website, internet websites, a second notes document, or digital textbooks. **Unlimited hard copy notes are also allowed, but NOT hardcopy textbooks.**

The exam may consist of short answer questions, short essay questions, and/or multiple choice questions.

Short answer questions test students’ ability to succinctly and correctly summarize the material listed in the syllabus. Problem questions test students’ ability to identify legal issues, accurately state the applicable legal rules, apply those rules to novel situations, and draw conclusions supported by analysis. In other words, problem questions require the exercise of independent judgment grounded in the application of general rules to specific fact situations. Essay questions test whether students have critically engaged with the course material and have started to form their own opinions about the strengths and weaknesses of the arguments, principles, and doctrines discussed in those materials. More details will be posted closer to the exam.

The Final Exam will cover **material from the entire course**.

### Exam Materials

The following is some further clarification of what materials students are allowed to refer to during the midterm and final examinations.

**Allowed**

- You may have one PDF document open during the exam. There is no size restriction on this PDF.
- You may have **unlimited printed/written notes with you in hardcopy form**.
- You may also have some **blank paper and a pen**.
- Your notes (both PDF and printed) can include passages directly copied and pasted from other sources - cases, texts, the online modules, discussion activities. Each copied passage can be up to 200 words in length. There is no limit on how many times in your notes you can include a 200 word passage.

**Not Allowed**

- you may not have your physical textbook with you, nor may you open the digital textbook on your computer
- you may not refer to full cases, printed out or on your computer.
- you may not print out entire modules from the course website, or refer to the website during the exam.
- you may not print out entire discussion threads from the course website, or refer to the website during the exam.
- Passages of up to 200 words of all the above may be incorporated into your notes instead.

### Discussions Boards

Discussion board posts must be your own thoughts in your own words. Please refrain from copying passages from the internet and pasting them into a discussion thread, or from using ChatGPT. **Quotations must also be marked and sourced.**

**Discussion threads will be available for comment for 2 weeks** – the week the activity is assigned, and one week following. After this 2 week period the thread will be closed for comments. Your Course Instructor will not accept late submissions via email. Students must seek a formal concession from the Faculty if they require an extension for medical or other reason.

### Proctorio Practice Exam

Students are required to download Proctorio and complete the Practice Exam at least 2 weeks in advance of their midterm exam. This will allow the students to identify and troubleshoot any technical issues and get familiar with the exam process. **It is essential that you complete your Practice Exam.** Students who fail to complete the Practice Exam will not be granted exam accommodations for technical issues.

### Additional Resources

The full text of the Constitution Acts of 1867 and 1982 can be found on the Department of Justice website at [http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/ConstLinks](http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/ConstLinks){:target=" \_blank"}.

Most of the required cases are also available free of charge on [CanLII](http://www.canlii.org/Links){:target=" \_blank"}. Other required texts (such as scholarly articles) will be available electronically on the course website.

Peter Hogg, **_Constitutional Law of Canada_** (2018 Student Edition), provides an excellent analysis of Canadian constitutional law by one of the country’s leading constitutional law scholars. When you have outstanding questions about Canadian constitutional law, I recommend that you turn to Hogg as one of your first resources.

Senator Eugene Forsey, “**_How Canadians Govern Themselves_**” (Library of Parliament, 6th ed., 2005) (available online: http://www.parl.gc.ca/information/library/idb/forsey/how-e.htmLinks to an external site.), provides a very brief overview of our system of government, designed for members of the general public.

Gerald Gall, **_The Canadian Legal System_** (5th ed., Carswell 2004) is an introductory text, often used in courses about law given in post-secondary institutions other than law schools.

Bernard Funston and Eugene Meehan, **_Canada’s Constitutional Law in a Nutshell_** (3rd ed., Carswell, 2003) provides a brief overview of Canadian constitutional law.

Patrick Monahan, **_Constitutional Law_** (Essentials of Canadian Law) (3rd ed., Irwin Law, 2006) is similar to the Funston and Meehan text but deals with issues at a greater level of sophistication.

Robert Sharpe and Kent Roach, **_The Charter of Rights and Freedoms_** (Essentials of Canadian Law) (3rd. ed., Irwin Law, 2005) provides an introductory discussion on the Charter.

### Deadlines, Deferrals and Academic Accommodation

The required forms as well as the full policy governing academic concession requests is available on the Allard Law website under [http://www.allard.ubc.ca/student-resources/jd-academic-services/academic-concessions-accommodationsLinks](http://www.allard.ubc.ca/student-resources/jd-academic-services/academic-concessions-accommodationsLinks){:target=" \_blank"}. For first time accommodation requests for medical reasons you do not need to submit a doctor's note but a Self Declaration Form will be sufficient.

Students have to submit the concession requests **within 72 hours** of the due date (discussion activities) or exam. If the form is submitted after this deadline the request will only be reviewed if the student can show a compelling reason for missing the 72 hour deadline such as hospitalization. All requests will be reviewed by the Law School and a decision will be communicated to the student as soon as a decision is available.

Please submit your forms to Alan Grove at [grove@allard.ubc.ca](grove@allard.ubc.ca){:target=" \_blank"} within 72 hours of the original exam/assignment date/deadline.
