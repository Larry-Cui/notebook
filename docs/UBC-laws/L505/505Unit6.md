# Aboriginal Law and the Canadian Constitution

Indigenous legal traditions are one of the legal inheritances that make up Canada's pluralistic system of law.  In this Unit, we will engage with those aspects of Canadian public law that arise from Aboriginal law and the rights of Aboriginal peoples.  This includes consideration of s. 35 of the *Constitution Act*, which explicitly recognizes Aboriginal rights, thus bringing Aboriginal rights and some Aboriginal legal traditions into direct conversation with Canadian constitutional law.

In this course, “**Indigenous**” is sometimes used, especially when engaging with scholars who use this term, and “**Aboriginal**” is used when discussing s. 35 of the constitution, reflecting the language found there.

Aboriginal rights were entrenched in Canada's constitution in 1982.  S. 35 reads as follows:

> s. 35 (1) The existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby recognized and affirmed.

> (2) In this Act, "aboriginal peoples of Canada" includes the Indian, Inuit and Métis peoples of Canada.

> (3) For greater certainty, in subsection (1) "treaty rights" includes rights that now exist by way of land claims agreements or may be so acquired.

> (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the aboriginal and treaty rights referred to in subsection (1) are guaranteed equally to male and female persons.

There are three things to notice immediately about the text of s. 35.

- First, it does not create Aboriginal rights, but only recognizes and affirms those rights.  This relates to the idea that the *Constitution Act* is not necessarily the source of Aboriginal rights, but rather the medium through which **existing Aboriginal law can be made part of Canadian constitutional law**.  In this way, s. 35 opens debates about the relationship between Canadian and Indigenous legal orders, as well as the legal consequences of Canada's colonial history.
- Second, s. 35 recognizes and affirms existing aboriginal and treaty rights.  Thus, the section creates for courts the task of interpreting what rights are “existing,” and what is required in order for it to be adequately recognized and affirmed.
- Third, despite the enormous diversity of indigenous peoples in Canada, s. 35 recognizes only three categories of aboriginal people: “**Indian**,” “**Inuit**” and “**Métis**.” The text of s. 35 thus requires courts to engage with questions about the boundaries of communities and the proper sources of knowledge to ground judgments about who is Aboriginal for the purposes of constitutional law.

#### <p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">Textbook Summary</p>

Despite the diversity that exists among the first peoples of Canada, the text of s 35(2) of the *Constitution Act*, 1982 makes only three distinctions among Aboriginal peoples (as Indigenous peoples are labelled in that text): the **Indian**, **Inuit**, and **Métis**.

The federal government has maintained the term “Indian” as a category to recognize certain Indigenous people as holding status under its *Indian Act*, RSC 1985, c I-5. In 2019 there were 1,008,955 registered status Indians in Canada. This number had grown from 670,000 in 2000. First Nations people who are not registered by the government under federal procedures are referred to as non-status Indians.

There is no federal Inuit registry, and thus the status/non-status distinction does not exist in this group.

The Métis originally formed as the result of 19th-century unions between male fur traders and primarily Indigenous women on the Canadian plains; this population of mixed ancestry forged a common cultural, political, and ethnic identity.

<!-- in 2014, the Supreme Court of Canada granted its first declaration of Aboriginal title in ***Tsilhqot’in Nation v. British Columbia***, [2014 SCC 44](https://canlii.ca/t/g7mt9){:target=" \_blank"}. 

historically, one of the primary methods to deal with Aboriginal title has been the signing of treaties following the principles outlined and agreed to in the *Royal Proclamation of 1763*. However, there were places in Canada where these principles were not followed, and land was not the subject of treaty promises. These areas include the **Maritimes**, **parts of the North**, **southern Quebec**, and **British Columbia**. The existence of Aboriginal title is a contemporary issue in these areas.

the issue of Aboriginal title in British Columbia did not appear before the courts until the early 1970s in the ***Calder*** case and did not receive any treatment under s 35(1) until the groundbreaking case of ***Delgamuukw v British Columbia***, immediately below.
