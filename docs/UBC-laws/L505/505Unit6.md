# Aboriginal Law and the Canadian Constitution

Indigenous legal traditions are one of the legal inheritances that make up Canada's pluralistic system of law.  In this Unit, we will engage with those aspects of Canadian public law that arise from Aboriginal law and the rights of Aboriginal peoples.  This includes consideration of s. 35 of the *Constitution Act*, which explicitly recognizes Aboriginal rights, thus bringing Aboriginal rights and some Aboriginal legal traditions into direct conversation with Canadian constitutional law.

In this course, “**Indigenous**” is sometimes used, especially when engaging with scholars who use this term, and “**Aboriginal**” is used when discussing s. 35 of the constitution, reflecting the language found there.

Aboriginal rights were entrenched in Canada's constitution in 1982.  S. 35 reads as follows:

> s. 35 (1) The existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby recognized and affirmed.

> (2) In this Act, "aboriginal peoples of Canada" includes the Indian, Inuit and Métis peoples of Canada.

> (3) For greater certainty, in subsection (1) "treaty rights" includes rights that now exist by way of land claims agreements or may be so acquired.

> (4) Notwithstanding any other provision of this Act, the aboriginal and treaty rights referred to in subsection (1) are guaranteed equally to male and female persons.

There are three things to notice immediately about the text of s. 35.

- First, it does not create Aboriginal rights, but only recognizes and affirms those rights.  This relates to the idea that the *Constitution Act* is not necessarily the source of Aboriginal rights, but rather the medium through which **existing Aboriginal law can be made part of Canadian constitutional law**.  In this way, s. 35 opens debates about the relationship between Canadian and Indigenous legal orders, as well as the legal consequences of Canada's colonial history.
- Second, s. 35 recognizes and affirms existing aboriginal and treaty rights.  Thus, the section creates for courts the task of interpreting what rights are “existing,” and what is required in order for it to be adequately recognized and affirmed.
- Third, despite the enormous diversity of indigenous peoples in Canada, s. 35 recognizes only three categories of aboriginal people: “**Indian**,” “**Inuit**” and “**Métis**.” The text of s. 35 thus requires courts to engage with questions about the boundaries of communities and the proper sources of knowledge to ground judgments about who is Aboriginal for the purposes of constitutional law.

#### <p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">Textbook Summary</p>

Despite the diversity that exists among the first peoples of Canada, the text of s 35(2) of the *Constitution Act*, 1982 makes only three distinctions among Aboriginal peoples (as Indigenous peoples are labelled in that text): the **Indian**, **Inuit**, and **Métis**.

The federal government has maintained the term “Indian” as a category to recognize certain Indigenous people as holding status under its *Indian Act*, RSC 1985, c I-5. In 2019 there were 1,008,955 registered status Indians in Canada. This number had grown from 670,000 in 2000. First Nations people who are not registered by the government under federal procedures are referred to as non-status Indians.

There is no federal Inuit registry, and thus the status/non-status distinction does not exist in this group.

The Métis originally formed as the result of 19th-century unions between male fur traders and primarily Indigenous women on the Canadian plains; this population of mixed ancestry forged a common cultural, political, and ethnic identity.

**COMMON LAW FOUNDATIONS OF CONSTITUTIONAL RECOGNITION**

Constitutional law in relation to Indigenous peoples has become an amalgam of different legal sources. Its doctrines are informed by, *inter alia*, the traditional laws and customs of Indigenous peoples, French and British colonial practice, executive proclamations, British legislative action, treaties, Privy Council rulings and decisions of the senior appellate courts of the United States and Australia, international law, and various sections of the *British North America Acts* and *Constitution Act*, 1982.

Most, if not all, constitutional issues involving Indigenous peoples occur against the back-drop of Aboriginal rights with respect to land.

The *Royal Proclamation* of 1763 stipulated that “lands and territories not included within the limits of [the governments created under the Royal Proclamation, including that of Quebec], or within the limits of the territory granted to the Hudson’s Bay Company” be reserved under the King’s protection and dominion for the use of the Indians.

Until the Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in ***Calder et al. v. Attorney-General of British Columbia***, [1973 CanLII 4 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1nfn4){:target=" \_blank"}, the Royal Proclamation was generally viewed by the judiciary as the sole Anglo–Canadian legal source of Indigenous rights.

An **exception** to this idea of the source of Indigenous rights lay with the famous decision by Monk J in ***Connolly v. Woolrich and Johnson et al.***, [1867 CanLII 13 (QC CS)](https://canlii.ca/t/k8t1q){:target=" \_blank"}, discussed below in an excerpt from a report by the Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples.

!!! info "Canada, Royal Commission on Aboriginal Peoples"

    - In support of his claim, John Connolly argued that the marriage between his mother and William Connolly was valid under Cree law and that the couple had been in “community of property,” so that each partner to the marriage was entitled to one-half of their jointly owned property. When William died, only his half-share of the property could be left to Julia, with the other half passing automatically to Suzanne as his lawful wife. On Suzanne’s death, her children would be entitled to inherit her share of the estate, now in the hands of Julia. 
    - It held that the Cree marriage between Suzanne and William was valid and that their eldest son was entitled to his rightful share of the estate.
    - the British Crown did not interfere with the domestic affairs of its Indian allies and dependencies, so that they remained self-governing in internal matters. This decision portrays Aboriginal peoples as **autonomous nations** living within the protection of the Crown but retaining their territorial rights, political organizations and common laws. 
    - The doctrine of Aboriginal rights is not a modern innovation, invented by courts to remedy injustices perpetrated in the past. ... [T]he doctrine was reflected in the numerous **treaties** of peace and friendship concluded in the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries between Aboriginal peoples and the French and British Crowns. Aboriginal rights are also apparent in the *Royal Proclamation of 1763* and other instruments of the same period, and in the **treaties** signed in Ontario, the west, and the northwest during the late nineteenth and early twentieth century. 

In 1884, in a case called ***Guerin v. The Queen***, [1984 CanLII 25 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1lpfn){:target=" \_blank"}, the Supreme Court of Canada agreed with Hall J and found that **Indian title was an independent legal interest** which predated and survived in spite of Crown assertions of sovereignty. Only Dickson J discussed the **nature of Indian interests in land** as it relates to governmental obligations.

!!! info "*Guerin v. The Queen*, [1984 CanLII 25 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1lpfn){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - In recognizing that the Proclamation is not the sole source of Indian title the ***Calder*** decision **went beyond** the judgment of the Privy Council in ***St. Catherine’s Milling & Lumber Co. v. The Queen (1888)***, 14 App. Cas. 46. In this respect ***Calder*** is consistent with the position of Chief Justice Marshall in the leading American cases of ***Johnson v. M’Intosh, 8 Wheaton 543 (1823)***, and ***Worcester v. State of Georgia, 6 Peters 515 (1832)***.
    - In ***Johnson v. M’Intosh***, **Marshall C.J.**, although he acknowledged the Proclamation of 1763 as one basis for recognition of Indian title, was none the less of [the] opinion that the rights of Indians in the lands they traditionally occupied prior to European colonization both **predated** and **survived** the claims to sovereignty made by various European nations in the territories of the North American continent. 
    - Indians have a legal right to occupy and possess certain lands, the ultimate title to which is in the Crown. While their interest does not, strictly speaking, amount to beneficial ownership, neither is its nature completely exhausted by the concept of a personal right. 
    - It is true that the ***sui generis*** interest which the Indians have in the land is personal in the sense that it cannot be transferred to a grantee, but it is also true, as will presently appear, that the interest gives rise upon surrender to a distinctive fiduciary obligation on the part of the Crown to deal with the land for the benefit of the surrendering Indians. 

In ***Guerin***, Dickson CJ interpreted Calder as deriving common law Aboriginal title from Indigenous peoples’ historic occupation and possession of their ancestral lands. No mention is made of ***Connolly v Woolrich*** or the possibility that Indigenous legal systems might be the source of Aboriginal rights.

**THE CONSTITUTIONAL ENTRENCHMENT OF ABORIGINAL RIGHTS**

Aboriginal and treaty rights were entrenched in Canada’s newly patriated *Constitution Act* in 1982, as part II of that instrument, outside its Charter of Rights and Freedoms. 

Section 35(1) protects these rights by stating that 

> the existing aboriginal and treaty rights of the aboriginal peoples of Canada are hereby recognized and affirmed.

The problem with this language was that no one was quite sure what Aboriginal and treaty rights existed as of that date, and therefore what, if anything, was being protected. 

!!! info "*R. v. Sparrow*, [1990 CanLII 104 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fsvj){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - This appeal requires this Court to explore for the first time the **scope** of s. 35(1) of the *Constitution Act*, 1982, and to indicate its strength as a promise to the aboriginal peoples of Canada.
    - The word “**existing**” makes it clear that the rights to which s. 35(1) applies are those that were in existence when the *Constitution Act*, 1982 came into effect. This means that extinguished rights are not revived by the Constitution Act, 1982. ... [T]he phrase “existing aboriginal rights” must be interpreted flexibly so as to permit their evolution over time. ... [A]n approach to the constitutional guarantee embodied in s. 35(1) which would incorporate “frozen rights” must be rejected.
    - That the right is **controlled** in great detail by the regulations does not mean that the right is thereby **extinguished**. ... The **test of extinguishment** to be adopted, in our opinion, is that the **Sovereign’s intention must be clear and plain** if it is to extinguish an aboriginal right.
    - The nature of s. 35(1) itself suggests that it be **construed in a purposive way**. When the purposes of the affirmation of aboriginal rights are considered, it is clear that a generous, liberal interpretation of the words in the constitutional provision is demanded.
    - In ***Nowegijick v. The Queen***, [1983 CanLII 18 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1lpd4){:target=" \_blank"} at p. 36, the following principle that should govern the interpretation of Indian treaties and statutes was set out:
        - ... [T]reaties and statutes relating to Indians should be liberally construed and doubtful expressions resolved in favour of the Indians. 
    - In ***R. v. Agawa***, [1988 CanLII 148 (ON CA)](https://canlii.ca/t/1npn7){:target=" \_blank"}, Blair J.A. stated that the above principle should apply to the interpretation of s. 35(1).
    - [I]t is true that s. 35(1) is **not subject to s. 1** of the *Charter*. In our opinion, this does not mean that any law or regulation affecting aboriginal rights will automatically be of no force or effect by the operation of s. 52 of the Constitution Act, 1982.
    - Federal legislative powers continue, including, of course, the right to legislate with respect to Indians pursuant to s. 91(24) of the *Constitution Act*, 1867. ... federal power must be reconciled with federal duty and the best way to achieve that reconciliation is to demand the justification of any government regulation that infringes upon or denies aboriginal rights.
    - The extent of legislative or regulatory impact on an existing aboriginal right may be scrutinized so as to ensure recognition and affirmation. 
    - **Test for justification of s. 35(1) interference**
    - The **first question** to be asked is whether the legislation in question has the effect of interfering with an existing aboriginal right. If it does have such an effect, it represents a *prima facie* infringement of s. 35(1). 
    - To determine whether [aboriginal rights] have been interfered with such as to constitute a *prima facie* infringement of s. 35(1), certain questions must be asked. 
        - First, is the limitation unreasonable? 
        - Second, does the regulation impose undue hardship? 
        - Third, does the regulation deny to the holders of the right their preferred means of exercising that right? 
    - The onus of proving a *prima facie* infringement lies on the individual or group challenging the legislation.
    - If a *prima facie* interference is found, the **analysis moves to the issue of justification**.
        - First, is there a valid legislative objective?
        - If a valid legislative objective is found, the analysis proceeds to the **second part** of the justification issue. Here, ... the guiding interpretive principle [is that] ... the honour of the Crown is at stake in dealings with aboriginal peoples. The special trust relationship and the responsibility of the government vis-à-vis aboriginals must be the first consideration in determining whether the legislation or action in question can be justified. 
        - Within the analysis of justification, there are further questions to be addressed, depending on the circumstances of the inquiry. These include the questions of 
            - whether there has been as little infringement as possible in order to effect the desired result; 
            - whether, in a situation of expropriation, fair compensation is available; and 
            - whether the aboriginal group in question has been consulted with respect to the conservation measures being implemented. 

The Court in ***Sparrow*** did not provide detailed reasons why fishing was an Aboriginal right. 

In ***Sparrow***, the Court acknowledged that there was no explicit language in s 35 to authorize an assessment of the legitimacy of any governmental action that might restrict Aboriginal rights.


!!! info "*R. v. Van der Peet*, [1996 CanLII 216 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fr8r){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - [15] ... at the heart of this appeal: How should the aboriginal rights **recognized and affirmed** by s. 35(1) of the *Constitution Act*, 1982 be defined? 
    - [17] Section 35(1), it is true, recognizes and affirms existing aboriginal rights, but it must not be forgotten that the **rights** it recognizes and affirms are **aboriginal**. 
    - [21] The way to accomplish this task is, as was noted at the outset, through a **purposive approach** to s. 35(1). ... a purposive approach to s. 35(1) will ensure that that which is found to fall within the provision is related to the provision’s intended focus: **aboriginal **people and their rights in relation to Canadian society as a whole. 
    - [23] Before turning to a purposive analysis of s. 35(1), however, it should be noted that such analysis must take place in light of the **general principles** which apply to the legal relationship between the Crown and aboriginal peoples. In ***R v Sparrow***, this Court held at p. 1106 that s. 35(1) should be given **a generous and liberal interpretation in favour of aboriginal peoples**.
    - [31] More specifically, what s. 35(1) does is provide the constitutional framework through which the fact that aboriginals lived on the land in distinctive societies, with their own practices, traditions and cultures, is **acknowledged and reconciled** with the sovereignty of the Crown. The substantive rights which fall within the provision must be defined in light of this **purpose**.
    - **The Test for Identifying Aboriginal Rights in Section 35(1)**
    - [44] In order to fulfil the **purpose** underlying s. 35(1), i.e., **the protection and reconciliation of the interests which arise from the fact that prior to the arrival of Europeans in North America aboriginal peoples lived on the land in distinctive societies, with their own practices, customs and traditions**, the test for identifying [aboriginal rights ...] must be directed at identifying the crucial elements of those pre-existing distinctive societies.
    - [46] In light of the suggestion of ***Sparrow***, and the purposes underlying s. 35(1), the following **test** should be used to identify whether an applicant has established an aboriginal right protected by s. 35(1): 
        - **in order to be an aboriginal right an activity must be an element of a practice, custom or tradition integral to the distinctive culture of the aboriginal group claiming the right.** 
    - **Factors to Be Considered** in Application of the Integral to a Distinctive Culture Test
    - [49] In assessing a claim for the existence of an aboriginal right, a court must take into account the **perspective of the aboriginal people** claiming the right. 
    - [52] ... The **nature** of an applicant’s claim must be delineated in terms of the particular practice, custom or tradition under which it is claimed.
    - [55] The claimant must demonstrate that the practice, custom or tradition was **a central and significant part** of the society’s distinctive culture. He or she must demonstrate, in other words, that the practice, custom or tradition was one of the things which made the culture of the society distinctive, that it was one of the things that **truly made the society what it was**.
    - [60] The time period that a court should consider ... is the **period prior to contact** between aboriginal and European societies. Because it is the fact that distinctive aboriginal societies lived on the land prior to the arrival of Europeans that underlies the aboriginal rights protected by s. 35(1), it is to that **pre-contact period that the courts must look in identifying aboriginal rights**.
    - [63] ... Where an aboriginal community can demonstrate that a particular practice, custom or tradition is integral to its distinctive culture today, and that this practice, custom or tradition has **continuity** with the practices, customs and traditions of pre-contact times, that community will have demonstrated that the practice, custom or tradition is an aboriginal right for the purposes of s. 35(1). 
    - [65] I would note that the concept of continuity **does not require** aboriginal groups to provide evidence of **an unbroken chain of continuity** between their current practices, customs and traditions, and those which existed prior to contact. 
    - [68] ... a court should approach the rules of evidence, and interpret the evidence that exists, with **a consciousness of the special nature** of aboriginal claims, and of the **evidentiary difficulties**. The courts must not undervalue the evidence presented by aboriginal claimants simply because that evidence does not conform precisely with the evidentiary standards that would be applied in, for example, a private law torts case.
    - [69] ... [T]he existence of an aboriginal right will depend entirely on the practices, customs and traditions of the **particular aboriginal community claiming the right**. ... The fact that one group of aboriginal people has an aboriginal right to do a particular thing will not be, without something more, sufficient to demonstrate that another aboriginal community has the same aboriginal right.
    - [70] In identifying those practices, customs and traditions that constitute the aboriginal rights recognized and affirmed by s. 35(1), a court must ensure that the practice, custom or tradition relied upon in a particular case is **independently significant** to the aboriginal community claiming the right.
    - [71] The standard which a practice, custom or tradition must meet in order to be recognized as an aboriginal right is not that it be **distinct** to the aboriginal culture in question; the aboriginal claimants must simply demonstrate that the practice, custom or tradition is **distinctive**. 
        - A culture with a **distinct** tradition must claim that in having such a tradition it is different from other cultures;
        - By contrast, a culture that claims that a practice, custom or tradition is **distinctive**, is rather one about the culture’s own practices, customs or traditions considered apart from the practices, customs or traditions of any other culture. It is a claim that this tradition or custom makes the culture what it is, not that the practice, custom or tradition is different from the practices, customs or traditions of another culture. 
    - [73] ... where the practice, custom or tradition arose solely as a response to European influences then that practice, custom or tradition will not meet the standard for recognition of an aboriginal right.
    - [74] ... **aboriginal title** is a **sub-category of aboriginal rights** which deals solely with claims of rights to land. The relationship between aboriginal title and aboriginal rights must not, however, confuse the analysis of what constitutes an aboriginal right. Aboriginal rights arise from the prior occupation of land, but they also arise from the prior social organization and distinctive cultures of aboriginal peoples on that land.

Requiring Aboriginal rights to manifest continuity with practices, customs, and traditions that existed prior to contact raises conceptual problems with respect to **Métis** rights recognized by s 35(1), given that **Métis** peoples are post-contact communities: see ***R. v. Powley***, [2003 SCC 43](https://canlii.ca/t/51pd){:target=" \_blank"}. 

!!! info "*R. v. Gladstone*, [1996 CanLII 160 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fr8w){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - [54] In ***R v Sparrow***, Dickson CJ and La Forest J articulated a **two-part test** for determining whether government actions infringing aboriginal rights can be justified.
    - [59] ... in the circumstance where the aboriginal right has no internal limitation, the notion of priority, as articulated in ***Sparrow***, would mean that where an aboriginal right is recognized and affirmed that right would become an exclusive one.

the question of Aboriginal “title” to land is very important, particularly in those parts of Canada where there are no treaties.

#### <p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">Textbook Summary</p>

in 2014, the Supreme Court of Canada granted its first declaration of Aboriginal title in ***Tsilhqot’in Nation v. British Columbia***, [2014 SCC 44](https://canlii.ca/t/g7mt9){:target=" \_blank"}. 

historically, one of the primary methods to deal with Aboriginal title has been the signing of treaties following the principles outlined and agreed to in the *Royal Proclamation of 1763*. However, there were places in Canada where these principles were not followed, and land was not the subject of treaty promises. These areas include the **Maritimes**, **parts of the North**, **southern Quebec**, and **British Columbia**. The existence of Aboriginal title is a contemporary issue in these areas.

the issue of Aboriginal title in British Columbia did not appear before the courts until the early 1970s in the ***Calder*** case and did not receive any treatment under s 35(1) until the groundbreaking case of ***Delgamuukw v British Columbia***, immediately below.
