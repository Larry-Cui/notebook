#  Introduction

## 1.2 Sources of Canadian Law

There are three fundamental sources of Canadian law (or “inheritances” as the writers of Public Law put it). They are:

- Law from history, culture and tradition (including indigenous law, common law and civil law)
- International law
- Statutory law

### I. Indigenous Law and the Laws of Reception

Before 1982, Indigenous peoples in what is now Canada maintained their own legal and governance systems, which European colonizers initially recognized through nation-to-nation diplomacy. The **Royal Proclamation of 1763** affirmed that Indigenous peoples held rights to their lands and could only surrender them to the Crown through formal, collective negotiations. 

Early legal interactions reinforced this coexistence, as shown in *Connolly v. Woolrich and Johnson et al.*, [1867 CanLII 13 (QC CS)](https://canlii.ca/t/k8t1q){:target=" \_blank"}, where a Quebec court upheld a Cree marriage under Indigenous law as legally valid for colonial inheritance purposes. Justice Monk emphasized that Indigenous legal systems were not abolished by colonization and retained force alongside colonial law.

The recognition of Aboriginal title in modern courts, particularly through Section 35 of the *Constitution Act*, 1982, reinforced the legal continuity of Indigenous land rights. Courts like in *Calder* and *Delgamuukw* have found that **Aboriginal title exists unless clearly extinguished by law or surrender**. Justice Hall, writing in *Calder*, described Indigenous title as protected by the **Royal Proclamation**, comparing its constitutional significance to that of the ***Magna Carta***. These developments mark a shift from a colonial legal framework to one that must reconcile with the prior and continuing presence of Indigenous law and governance.

### II. Common Law and *Stare Decisis*

Canadian law is heavily shaped by its colonial inheritance, particularly from Britain and France. The principle of “reception” governed how European legal traditions applied in the colonies. In “**settled**” colonies (believed to be unoccupied), English common law was presumed to apply automatically unless expressly altered. In contrast, “**conquered**” colonies retained their pre-existing laws until formally changed. This distinction was complicated in Canada by the presence of Indigenous legal systems and competing French claims. 

Quebec, for example, retained French civil law in private matters after the Quebec Act of 1774, while the rest of the provinces largely adopted English common law. This created Canada’s current **bijural system**: a mixture of civil and common law traditions.

The common law system, inherited from England, is built not on codified statutes but on judicial precedent. Past court decisions (case law) serve as authoritative rules that guide future judgments in similar fact scenarios. This is the doctrine of ***stare decisis***, which fosters legal certainty, fairness, and efficiency. 

However, judges are not bound by everything said in a previous ruling - only the ***ratio decidendi*** (the legal reasoning essential to the outcome) is binding; other remarks (called ***obiter dicta***) are not. Courts also consider their position in the judicial hierarchy: lower courts are bound by higher courts, and even appellate courts may reconsider their past rulings, especially if the precedent was weak or unclear.

The Canadian system has nuanced rules about when precedent is binding. For example, **all courts must follow decisions of the Supreme Court of Canada and pre-1949 rulings of the Privy Council unless overruled**. However, courts in one province are not bound by appellate rulings in another. Judges often face challenges in determining what part of a ruling counts as precedent, particularly when reasoning is ambiguous or multiple opinions are given. Despite these complexities, the doctrine of precedent remains a cornerstone of the Canadian legal system and contributes significantly to its structure and predictability.


**a. Vertical *Stare Decisis***

Vertical *stare decisis* means that decisions from higher courts are binding on lower courts within the same judicial hierarchy. This doctrine maintains consistency in the interpretation of law and ensures that trial judges do not contradict rulings from appellate courts.

In British Columbia, for example, all decisions from the British Columbia Court of Appeal are binding on the BC Supreme Court and the Provincial Court of BC. If a judge in the BC Supreme Court disagrees with a decision of the BC Court of Appeal, they are nevertheless bound to follow it. Only the Supreme Court of Canada stands above the provincial courts of appeal, and its decisions are binding across the entire country.

This structure ensures a top-down uniformity in legal reasoning. A trial court cannot substitute its own interpretation for that of a superior court, even if it finds the higher court's decision to be outdated or flawed. **The appropriate remedy in such a case would be to distinguish the facts or, where possible, to await clarification or reversal by a higher court.**


**b. Horizontal *Stare Decisis***

Horizontal *stare decisis* refers to the practice of courts following their own previous decisions or those of courts at the same level within the same jurisdiction. This principle supports legal certainty but allows a degree of flexibility.

Within the BC Supreme Court, judges generally follow past decisions of other BC Supreme Court judges. While technically not binding, these decisions are treated as strongly persuasive. This practice promotes stability and predictability, especially in areas of law where appellate guidance may be sparse. That said, a judge may depart from a peer’s earlier decision if convinced that it was wrongly decided or if new reasoning or legislation has emerged.

The BC Court of Appeal generally follows its own prior decisions. **However, it does have the authority to overrule itself in appropriate circumstances.** When doing so, the court will often sit as a five-judge panel (rather than the usual three) to reconsider significant legal issues, as was done in R. v. Sidhu (2015 BCCA 224), which revisited previous interpretations of sentencing principles.


**c. Exceptions to Horizontal Precedent: *Re Hansard Spruce Mills***

The leading case on when courts can depart from their own level’s precedent is *Hansard Spruce Mills Limited (Re)*, [1954 CanLII 253 (BC SC)](https://canlii.ca/t/gbvxl){:target=" \_blank"}, a decision of the BC Supreme Court. In that case, Justice Wilson articulated **three narrowly defined situations** where a trial-level judge could decline to follow a decision from another judge of the same court:

- **Subsequent Higher Court Ruling:** If the earlier decision is undermined by a higher court (e.g., the BC Court of Appeal or Supreme Court of Canada), it may no longer be good law.

- **Decided *Per Incuriam*:** If the earlier decision failed to consider relevant statutory or case law, it may be treated as made in error and thus non-binding.

- **Made Under Exigent Circumstances:** Where the earlier ruling was given without full argument or in an emergency context, it may not warrant continued application.

These criteria have been adopted widely across Canadian provinces and were recently reaffirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada in *R. v. Sullivan*, [2022 SCC 19](https://canlii.ca/t/jp64b){:target=" \_blank"}. The Court emphasized that departures from precedent at the same level should remain exceptional, to avoid judicial inconsistency and uncertainty.

 
**d. Inter-provincial Precedent**

In Canada's federal structure, each province maintains its own judicial hierarchy. This means that decisions from, say, the Ontario Court of Appeal are not binding on courts in British Columbia. However, they are often treated as **persuasive authority**, particularly when:

- There is no binding appellate authority on the issue within BC;

- The reasoning is well-articulated and grounded in shared national legal principles;

- Uniformity in law across provinces is desirable (e.g., commercial law, Charter interpretation).

It’s also common for judges to canvass precedent across multiple provinces when writing decisions with broader implications. This comparative approach helps build coherence in Canadian jurisprudence even without formal binding force across provincial borders.
 

**e. *Ratio Decidendi* vs. *Obiter Dicta***

Not all parts of a court decision carry equal legal weight. The *ratio decidendi* is the central legal rule or principle necessary to resolve the case. It is the binding part of the judgment that must be followed in future cases dealing with similar facts or issues.

By contrast, *obiter dicta* refers to incidental remarks, hypothetical examples, or broader observations made by the judge that were not essential to the outcome. These comments may offer helpful guidance but are not binding. Nevertheless, particularly influential obiter statements, especially from higher courts, may carry considerable persuasive value.

Determining what constitutes the ratio can be complex, especially in appellate judgments with multiple concurring opinions. In such cases, the ratio is usually distilled from the shared reasoning that commanded the majority of the court.

    - This part of the decision is about "B. Should This Court Overrule Moldowan?"
    - [26] Courts must proceed with caution when deciding to overrule a prior decision.  In *Queensland v. Commonwealth* (1977), 139 C.L.R. 585 (H.C.A.), at p. 599, Justice Gibbs articulated the required approach succinctly:

        No Justice is entitled to ignore the decisions and reasoning of his predecessors, and to arrive at his own judgment as though the pages of the law reports were blank, or as though the authority of a decision did not survive beyond the rising of the Court.  A Justice, unlike a legislator, cannot introduce a programme of reform which sets at nought decisions formerly made and principles formerly established.  **It is only after the most careful and respectful consideration of the earlier decision, and after giving due weight to all the circumstances, that a Justice may give effect to his own opinions in preference to an earlier decision of the Court.**
    - [27] The vertical convention of precedent is not at issue with respect to the decision as to whether the Supreme Court should overrule one of its own precedents. Rather, in making this decision the Supreme Court engages in a balancing exercise between the two important values of **correctness** and **certainty**.  The Court must ask whether it is preferable to adhere to an incorrect precedent to maintain certainty, or to correct the error.


!!! note "*Carter v. Canada*, [2015 SCC 5](https://canlii.ca/t/gg5z4){:target=" \_blank"} at paras 40-48"

    - This part of the decision discussed the issue: whether this Court’s decision in *Rodriguez* can be revisited?
    - [43] ... Ontario goes so far as to argue that “vertical *stare decisis*” is a constitutional principle that requires all lower courts to rigidly follow this Court’s Charter precedents unless and until this Court sets them aside.
    - [44] However, *stare decisis* is not a straitjacket that condemns the law to stasis.  Trial courts **may reconsider settled rulings of higher courts** in two situations:  (1) where a new legal issue is raised; and (2) where there is a change in the circumstances or evidence that “fundamentally shifts the parameters of the debate”.


### III.  Statutory Law

In Canada today, while many areas of law still reflect their common law roots, modern legal systems increasingly rely on statutes. Parliament and provincial legislatures have full authority to create new laws or change existing ones. They can also use legislation to **override or expand** upon principles that had previously been developed by judges. In some areas, the common law remains foundational, but in others, especially those governed by detailed statutory regimes, the law is almost entirely codified.

The relationship between statutes and common law is not always simple. Generally, when legislation clearly contradicts a prior court decision, the statutory rule takes priority. 

Complexity arises when a statute is vague or silent on a point that the common law has already addressed. This is where courts may continue to apply established case law or interpret how the two sources of law interact. A good example of this interplay is found in the development of same-sex marriage in Canada, which involved a mix of constitutional rulings, evolving statutory provisions, and reinterpretation of longstanding legal definitions.

 

### IV. International Law

In modern legal systems, law operates on two distinct levels: domestic and international. Domestic law consists of the rules and principles that govern the daily affairs of individuals within a state. In Canada, this includes statutes enacted by legislatures and regulations created by the executive, alongside the common law (judge-made legal rules developed through precedent). 

Constitutional law sits at the top of this hierarchy and includes both written texts, like the Constitution Act, 1867, and unwritten principles that shape Canada's democratic framework.

International law, by contrast, regulates the conduct of states on the global stage. Its two primary sources are treaties (formal agreements between states) and customary international law (general practices accepted as law). Treaties can be bilateral or multilateral and may take various forms, such as conventions or protocols. They become binding only on the states that consent to them. Customary international law, however, applies more broadly, even to states that haven't explicitly consented, as long as there is widespread state practice and a belief that such practice is legally required. A notable example is the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which, although originally not legally binding, has increasingly been treated as reflecting customary law.

Canada takes a "**dualist**" approach to treaties, meaning that an international agreement does not automatically become part of domestic law upon ratification. Instead, **legislation must be enacted to give it domestic effect.** This process ensures parliamentary control but can lead to a gap where Canada is internationally bound yet domestically non-compliant. This dualist structure also reflects Canada’s federal system, where both federal and provincial governments hold legislative powers. **The requirement for legislative transformation safeguards democratic legitimacy by involving elected representatives.**

However, Canada's approach to customary international law is different. Here, Canada is more “**monist**,” meaning that **once a rule is recognized as customary international law, it becomes part of Canadian common law automatically, unless explicitly overridden by statute.** This raises legitimacy concerns because customary norms are incorporated through judicial recognition rather than elected legislative action. Courts, not legislatures, play a key role in determining the domestic legal status of these international norms. Additionally, the content of customary law can be vague, and judges may rely on expert testimony from international lawyers to interpret it. While this may seem at odds with Canadian democratic traditions, it fits within the broader role Canadian courts have always played in shaping the common law.
