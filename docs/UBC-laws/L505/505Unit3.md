# The Canadian Constitution


<p class="highlight green" markdown="1">Constitutional law is the law prescribing **the exercise of power by the organs of a State**. It explains which organs can exercise legislative power (making new laws), executive power (implementing the laws) and judicial power (adjudicating disputes), and what the limitations on those powers are.<br> In a federal state, **the allocation of governmental powers (legislative, executive and judicial) among central and regional (state or provincial) authorities** is a basic concern.<br> **Civil liberties** are also part of constitutional law, because civil liberties may be created by the rules that limit the exercise of governmental power over individuals.</p>
