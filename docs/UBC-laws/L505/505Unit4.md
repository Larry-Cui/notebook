# Federalism

Canada is a federal state. This means that political power is shared between two orders of government: the federal government and the provincial governments. Each government is assigned different spheres of jurisdiction by the Constitution Act, 1867, most importantly in **ss. 91 and 92**.

!!! info "Fathers of Confederation"

    **Robert Harris**’s Fathers of Confederation, perhaps Canada’s best-known historical painting, was destroyed in the 1916 fire at the original Parliament Building. An aging Harris had declined to reproduce the work, and in 1964 the Confederation Life Assurance Co. hired Toronto artist **Rex Woods** to create a version of the original composition. Woods increased the dimensions to 3.5 meters by two metres, added three figures and, in the background, a portrait of Harris.

    The original painting pictured delegates to the **Charlottetown** and **Quebec** conferences that laid the ground for the confederation of Canada in 1864. The sobriquet “Fathers of Confederation” arose later and eventually became the title of the painting.

## 4.1 Introduction to the Division of Powers

    Constitutional Law: Chapter 4 (pp. 94-97), Chapter 7 (pp. 165-173) including Simeon article, Chapters 4 (pp. 73-80) and Chapter 6 (pp. 148-151).

If legislative supremacy was a fundamental constitutional principle, how could courts review statutes and declare them to be void? **WJ Ritchie**, Chief Justice of New Brunswick, responded at **_The Queen v. Chandler_**; In re Hazleton, [1869 CanLII 96](https://canlii.ca/t/jkjkv){:target=" \_blank"}, at 556-557:

> We must recognize the undoubted legislative control of the British Parliament, and give full force and effect to the statute of the Supreme Legislature, and ignore the Act of the sub-ordinate, when ... they are repugnant and in conflict.

That is, courts would interpret the BNA Act to determine whether it gave the power to enact the statute. Chief Justice **Ritchie**’s views, however, quickly took hold in the Canadian legal imagination, and thereafter judicial review was so firmly established that it needed little or no explanation or justification.

> It could not have been the intention that a conflict should exist; and, in order to prevent such a result, the two sections (ss. 91, 92) must be read together, and the language of one interpreted, and, where necessary, modified, by that of the other.
>
> The first question to be decided is, whether the Act [provincial legislature] ... falls within any of the classes of subjects enumerated in s. 92, ... for if it does not, it can be of no validity.
>
> [Second], whether, notwithstanding this is so, the subject of the Act does not also fall within one of the enumerated classes of subjects in s. 91, and whether the power of the provincial legislature is or is not thereby overborne.

**THE NATURE OF FEDERALISM**

A federal state is a political contrivance intended to reconcile national unity and power with the maintenance of “state rights.” For the method by which federalism attempts to reconcile ... consists of the formation of a constitution under which the **ordinary powers of sovereignty** are elaborately **divided** between the **common or national government** and the **separate states**.

Whatever concerns the nation as a whole should be placed under the control of the national government. All matters which are not primarily of common interest should remain in the hands of the several States.

**Three leading characteristics** of completely developed federalism:

- the **supremacy** of the constitution
- the **distribution** among bodies with limited and co-ordinate authority of the different powers of government
- the authority of the Courts to act as **interpreters** of the constitution.

**THE COMPACT THEORY**

Thomas Jean Jacques Loranger, a Quebec judge, set out the elements of the “federal compact”:

1. In constituting themselves into a confederation, the provinces did not intend to renounce, and in fact never did renounce their autonomy. ... it is from these provincial powers that has arisen the federal government, to which the provinces have ceded a portion of their rights, property and revenues.
2. The federal compact did not create a single new power. The part now belonging to the federal government was taken from the jurisdiction of the provinces.

**THE POWER OF DISALLOWANCE**

The power, as expressed in ss 56 and 90 of the Constitution Act, 1867, entitles the governor general, acting on the advice of the federal Cabinet, to **disallow (or veto)** any enactment of the **provincial legislatures**.

By the mid-20th century, the federal power of disallowance fell into **disuse**.

    - *Canada (Attorney General) v Ontario (Attorney General)*, [1937 CanLII 362 (UK JCPC)](https://canlii.ca/t/grlg9){:target=" \_blank"}, on appeal from *References re the Weekly Rest in Industrial Undertakings Act, The Minimum Wages Act, And The Limitation of Hours of Work Act*, [1936 CanLII 24](https://canlii.ca/t/fslfw){:target=" \_blank"}.
    - Within the British Empire there is a well-established rule that the making of a treaty is an executive act, while the performance of its obligations, if they entail alteration of the existing domestic law, requires legislative action.
    - The first ground upon which counsel for the Dominion sought to base the validity of the legislation was s. 132 ... it was not contemplated in 1867 that the Dominion would possess treaty-making powers, it is impossible to strain the section so as to cover the un-contemplated event. It appears that all the members of the Supreme Court **rejected** the contention based on **s. 132**, and their Lordships are in full agreement with them.
    - the validity of the legislation can only depend upon ss. 91 and 92. If the new functions affect the classes of subjects enumerated in s. 92, legislation to support the new functions is in the competence of the Provincial Legislatures only. If they do not, the competence of the Dominion Legislature is declared by s. 91 and existed *ab origine*. In other words, the Dominion cannot, merely by making promises to foreign countries, clothe itself with legislative authority inconsistent with the constitution which gave it birth.
    - But the legislative powers remain **distributed**, and if in the exercise of her new functions ... when they deal with provincial classes of subjects, be dealt with by the totality of powers, in other words by **co-operation between the Dominion and the Provinces**.


## 4.2 Interpreting the Division of Powers: Validity

There are **three** kinds of arguments that can be made to challenge a law on the ground of division of powers.  

- First, if the dominant characteristic of a law relates to a matter that is beyond the enacting **legislature's jurisdiction**, the law is invalid.  
- Second, even if the law is validly enacted, it may have to be limited in its application in order that it not touch upon matters at the core of the other level of government's jurisdiction (this is known as the doctrine of "**inter-jurisdictional immunity**").  
- Finally, even if a provincial law is valid, and even if it is applicable, it will be made inoperative if it conflicts a valid federal statute that relates to the same facts (this is the doctrine of **federal "paramountcy"**).

!!! note "Readings"

    Constitutional Law: Chapter 8 (pp. 173-184), (pp. 184-191) and (pp. 191-225) 

Sections 91 & 92 grant each level of government the power to enact laws in relation to all matters coming within the classes of subjects enumerated. The items on the lists are the “**classes of subjects**” that fall within the jurisdiction of each level of government.

If a legislature enacts laws that relate to matters that do NOT fall within one of the classes of subjects over which it has jurisdiction, that law is **INVALID**. The enacting legislature did not have the constitutional authority to create that legislation. The process of assessing the validity of a law is described as a process of “**classification**.” The law has to be matched up with a matter that falls within one of the classes of subjects in section 91 or 92.

The process of classification has three steps.

1. **Identification** of the matter of the statute
2. **Delineation** of the scope of the competing classifications
3. **Determination** of the class into which the challenged statute falls

There are **three things to note** in particular about the classification process.

- First, the lists in **sections 91 and 92 do not encompass everything** that a government could potentially want to legislate about. For example, given that the lists were created in the 19th century, courts had to decide subsequently where to assign jurisdiction over things like radio and
aeronautics.
- Second, it is often the case that the **definition of the “matter” of a statute is determinative of the outcome** of the challenge. Judges are aware of this, and so the identification of the matter is not a neutral exercise of logic. Rather, it often involves consideration of many important **constitutional values and exercise of judgment** about how the federal system should work.
- Finally, in federalism cases, the impugned legislation benefits from a **presumption of constitutionality**. This means that if there are competing plausible interpretations of the law, the court will choose the one that supports the validity of the law.


What do judges take into account when identifying the most important characteristic, or the “**pith and substance**” of a law?

- **social and economic effects** of the law, possibly including the way it is actually administered in
practice
- **purpose** of the law as revealed by political debates in the legislature
- broad **principles and values** about Canadian federalism
