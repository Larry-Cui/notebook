# Federalism

Canada is a federal state. This means that political power is shared between two orders of government: the federal government and the provincial governments. Each government is assigned different spheres of jurisdiction by the Constitution Act, 1867, most importantly in **ss. 91 and 92**.

!!! info "Fathers of Confederation"

    **Robert Harris**’s Fathers of Confederation, perhaps Canada’s best-known historical painting, was destroyed in the 1916 fire at the original Parliament Building. An aging Harris had declined to reproduce the work, and in 1964 the Confederation Life Assurance Co. hired Toronto artist **Rex Woods** to create a version of the original composition. Woods increased the dimensions to 3.5 meters by two metres, added three figures and, in the background, a portrait of Harris.

    The original painting pictured delegates to the **Charlottetown** and **Quebec** conferences that laid the ground for the confederation of Canada in 1864. The sobriquet “Fathers of Confederation” arose later and eventually became the title of the painting.
