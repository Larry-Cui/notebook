# Unit 1-4 Discussion

## 1.2 *Stare Decisis*

### Samantha

**Vertical** ***Stare Decisis*** applies directly "up the chain" of courts in one's own province.  A B.C. Provincial court judge would be bound to follow any BC Supreme Court (BCSC), BC Court of Appeal (BCCA) and Supreme Court of Canada (SCC) decisions.  The case that the judge follows also has to be "on point" to the issues being litigated in the present trial.

**Horizontal** ***Stare Decisis*** requires that a court follow decisions of the same court - so BC Provincial court judges should follow other BC Provincial court decisions that are also "on point".  Likewise, a BCSC judge would follow other BCSC decisions.   I see this one applied a little more loosely in practice though.

A BC judge is NOT however bound to follow any decisions from other provinces, no matter what level of court.  They are considered persuasive (if on point), but not binding.

In the ***Nguyen*** case, Judge Maughan was a BCPC judge, so she was technically not bound, under ***stare decisis***, by an OCA decision.

### Answer

***R. v. Nguyen***, 2002 BCPC 12 deals with a single issue: whether the investigating officers lawfully searched a vehicle parked on the property of a residence. The officers had a warrant to search the house, but the vehicle was not explicitly included in that warrant.

The defence cited the Supreme Court of Canada decision in ***Regina v. Brown (1997)***, B.C.J. No. 2642, to argue that the officers had no right to search the vehicle. The prosecution, however, relied on the Ontario Court of Appeal case ***Regina v. Haley***, 27 C.C.C. (3d) 454, in support of the search.

Judge Maughan, presiding in ***Nguyen***, discussed these two cases along with two other similar ones: ***R. v. Laplante*** (1987), S.J. No. 723, File No. 2676, and ***R. v. Brenner*** (2000), O.J. No. 3257, Court File No. 71/98. He concluded that “the issue before the court is a complex and unsettled area of the law,” but ultimately decided to follow the authority of ***Haley***, as that case “more approximate[s] the facts of the case at bar” than Brown.

I agree with Judge Maughan’s application of *stare decisis*.

At first glance, ***Brown*** is a Supreme Court of Canada case and, under the principle of vertical *stare decisis*, should be binding on all lower courts. However, as the SCC explained in ***Carter v. Canada***, 2015 SCC 5, at para. 44: “*stare decisis* is not a straitjacket that condemns the law to stasis. Trial courts may reconsider settled rulings of higher courts in two situations: (1) where a new legal issue is raised; and (2) where there is a change in the circumstances or evidence that ‘fundamentally shifts the parameters of the debate’.” A lower court may depart from a Supreme Court case by distinguishing the facts. That is precisely what Judge Maughan did here.

On the other hand, an Ontario Court of Appeal case such as ***Haley*** is not binding on a trial court in British Columbia under stare decisis. However, courts in each province may, at their discretion, refer to inter-provincial precedents if there is a gap in local case law on a particular issue, and the precedent from another province offers well-reasoned analysis grounded in shared national legal principles. From this perspective, Judge Maughan was justified in citing ***Haley*** to support his conclusion.

## 1.2 Borrows and the Recognition of Indigenous law

### Samantha

We will visit topics in Indigenous Law throughout the course.  It is worth earmarking this article in your notes, and come exam time, considering how it fits in with the bigger picture of Indigenous legal issues that we will learn about.

## 2.1 Senate Reform

### Samantha

Reading through all your suggestions, here are some I noted:

- **Implement term limits:** Introduce a maximum limit on the number of terms a senator can serve to encourage new perspectives and prevent entrenched power.
- **Introduce proportional representation:** Moving away from the current appointment-based system and adopt a proportional representation model where senators are elected based on the popular vote in each province or region.
- **Abolish partisan appointments:** Eliminate the practice of appointing senators based on political affiliation, ensuring a non-partisan and independent approach to representation.
- **Strengthen regional representation:** Establishing a more balanced representation of regions within the Senate to ensure equal voice and consideration for all provinces and territories.
- **Enhance diversity and inclusion:** Implement measures to promote greater diversity in the Senate, including gender parity, representation of Indigenous peoples, racial and ethnic minorities, and other underrepresented groups.
- **Increase transparency and accountability:** Enhance transparency by requiring senators to publicly disclose their financial interests and activities, and establish mechanisms for citizens to provide feedback and hold senators accountable.
- **Expand the role of Senate committees:** Empower Senate committees to play a more active role in legislative reviews, policy development, and oversight to enhance their impact on the legislative process.
- **Strengthen Senate independence:** Implement safeguards to ensure the Senate remains an independent body, free from undue influence or interference from the executive branch of government.
- **Introduce public hearings for Senate appointments:** Establish a process where nominees for Senate appointments undergo public hearings, allowing for scrutiny and input from the public and relevant stakeholders.

## 2.3 Judicial Independence

### Samantha

When dealing with any kind of fact pattern, we always want to see 

- (1) what, if any, statute applies to the situation, and 
- (2) whether the case law gives us any legal frameworks that we can use to assess the facts.  


For instance, removal of a judge should only be recommended to the Minister of Justice in the following situations, set out in s. 80 of the *Judges Act*.

> s.80 For the purposes of this Division, the removal from office of a judge is justified only if, for any of the following reasons, the judge’s continuation in office would undermine public confidence in the impartiality, integrity or independence of the judge or of their office to such an extent that it would render the judge incapable of executing the functions of judicial office:

> (a) infirmity;

> (b) misconduct;

> (c) failure in the due execution of judicial office;

> (d) the judge is in a position that a reasonable, fair-minded and informed observer would consider to be incompatible with the due execution of judicial office.

On an exam, I would want to see you refer to both these tests, then apply each factor to the facts one by one.  This can be done using the IRAC method - make sure you give it a google if you are not familiar with the IRAC approach to writing law school exams.

### Answer

In 2010, Alan Chapman filed a complaint with the Canadian Judicial Council and several lawsuits against Judge Lori Douglas, her husband Alan King, and the Winnipeg law firm Thompson Dorfman Sweatman (TDS). Both Judge Douglas and Mr. King had been lawyers at this firm in 2003. Mr. Chapman claimed that when he hired King for his divorce matter in 2003, King approached him on several occasions, showing him nude photos of his wife and inviting him to have sex with her. These sexually explicit photos had once appeared on a website called `darkcavern.com`, which was dedicated to an “interracial sex” theme. No evidence showed that Douglas was seducing Mr. Chapman or had any sexual relationship with him.

When this story came to light in 2010, it ignited public debate over whether Judge Douglas should be removed from judicial office. I think there were two issues in this case:

- If the incidents Mr. Chapman described had been disclosed before Lori Douglas was appointed as a judge of the Court of Queen’s Bench of Manitoba in 2005, and later promoted to Associate Chief Justice in 2009, would she still have been appointed?
- As of 2010, did conduct alleged to have occurred seven years earlier warrant her removal as a judge?

On the first issue, it seems clear that when recommending a candidate for judicial appointment, the Judicial Council would consider many factors, including any criminal, disciplinary, or litigation history, as well as financial, tax, or health issues. What Judge Douglas disclosed to the Council is unknown to the public, but the Minister of Justice who appointed her in 2005 stated that he had no knowledge of the photos. The public has good reason to believe that, had the incidents alleged by Mr. Chapman been disclosed, Douglas would not have been recommended or appointed as a judge.

On the second issue, the answer would be no. The standards for removing a judge from office are very high. Section 99(1) of the Constitution Act, 1867, 30 & 31 Vict, c 3 provides:

> Subject to subsection (2) of this section, the judges of the superior courts shall hold office during good behaviour, but shall be removable by the Governor General on address of the Senate and House of Commons.

The *Judges Act*, RSC 1985, c J-1, s 65(2) sets out very strict and narrow conditions under which the Canadian Judicial Council may recommend a judge’s removal. Simply put, only conduct that is extremely serious and egregious falls within the scope of removable reasons.


## 2.4 Legislative Record Evidence

### Samantha

Note that according to **Elmer Drieger**, who has written textbooks on Statutory Interpretation, Parliaments intentions are interpreted in four different ways:

- (1) **The expressed intention of Parliament:**  Intention expressed by the enacted words.  Looks at the textual meaning from published texts.

- (2) **Implied Intention:** Intention that may be implied from the enacted words 

- (3) **Presumed Intention:** The intention that the courts will in the absence of an indication to the contrary impute to Parliament.

- (4) **The declared intention:**  The intention that Parliament itself has said may be or must be or must not be imputed (assigned) to it.

I think one of the dangers of relying on the legislative record, as many of you pointed out, is that politicians are not always unified in their views.  Some may vote in favour of legislation but for a variety of different reasons and motivations.  The recorded reasons behind a piece of legislation may not fully represent the views of those who passed it.  Some other **dangers** are:

- speeches in Parliament, testimonies before Parliament subcommittees, and other originally “oral” manifestations, once reduced into text form, may no longer reflect the same initial intents and become subject to the reader’s control.

- the legislative record may reflect a short-lived and outdated personal/isolated view of an elected representative instead of the perspective of the House as a unity, which is supposed to be gradually constructed over the legislative process and transferred into the entire final text of the Act. 

- looking to the legislative record to identify legislative intent can put judicial interpretation in danger of adopting a particular view that does not reflect the collective intent of the Parliament or local legislature.

## 3.1 Public Interest Standing | Fact Pattern

### Samantha

In ***Canada (AG) v. Downtown Eastside Sex Workers***, **Cromwell J** stated that "[t]he Court has recognized that … there are occasions when public interest litigation is an appropriate vehicle to bring matters of public interest and importance before the courts" (para.22).  A court should consider the following three elements:

- (1) whether the case raises a serious justiciable issue;

- (2) whether the party bringing the action has a real stake or a genuine interest in its outcome; and

- (3) whether, having regard to a number of factors, the proposed suit is a reasonable and effective means to bring the case to court.

These three elements “should be assessed and weighted cumulatively, in light of the underlying purposes of limiting standing and applied in a flexible and generous manner that best serves those underlying purposes” (para.20).  

**(a) Serious Justiciable Issue**

In ***Downtown Eastside Sex Workers***, **Cromwell J** stated at para.42:

> To constitute a ‘serious issue’, the question raised must be a ‘substantial constitutional issue’ ... or an ‘important one’ ...  The claim must be ‘far from frivolous’ ..., although court should not examine the merits of the case in other than a preliminary manner.

**(b) The Nature of the Plaintiff’s Interest**

In ***Downtown Eastside Sex Workers***, **Cromwell J** stated at para.43:

> In my view, this factor is concerned with whether the plaintiff has a real stake in the proceedings or is engaged with the issues they raise. ... In ***Finlay***, for example, although the plaintiff did not in the Court’s view have standing as of right, he nonetheless had a direct, personal interest in the issues he sought to raise.  In ***Borowski***, the Court found that the plaintiff had a genuine interest in challenging the exculpatory provisions regarding abortion.  He was a concerned citizen and taxpayer and he had sought unsuccessfully to have the issue determined by other means ... (para.43)

**(c) Reasonable and Effective Means of Bringing the Issue Before the Court**

> This factor, like the other two, must be assessed in a flexible and purposive manner and weighed in light of the other factors. (para.52)

In addition, **Cromwell J** gave some examples of the types of matters that the courts may take into account:

- The plaintiff’s capacity to bring forward a claim;
- Whether the case is of public interest in the sense that it transcends the interests of those most directly affected by the challenged law or action;
- Whether there are realistic alternative means which would favour a more efficient and effective use of judicial resources;
- The potential impact of the proceedings on the rights of others who are equally or more directly affected.
 
After setting out this framework on an exam, I would then want to see students systematically apply the framework to the facts pattern, the draw a conclusion (as many of you have done below).

CONCLUSION

abc...

Here it was Harper's policy decision, not to appoint any more senators, that was the justiciable issue.   The government was failing to comply with s.32 of the *Constitution Act* which states that “when a vacancy happens in the Senate by resignation, death, or otherwise, the Governor General shall . . . fill the vacancy.”  That's what made it justiciable in this case.  This was argued to be "serious" because an underpopulated senate is not doing its job of representing a full range of Canadians, which renders it unable to do its job properly.

### Answer

**Conclusion:**

Mr. Alani should be granted public interest standing, as his application satisfies the three-part test established in ***Canada (Attorney General) v. Downtown Eastside Sex Workers United Against Violence Society***, 2012 SCC 45 (“***DESUAV***”), when assessed in light of the underlying purposes of the law of standing.

**Facts:**

On July 24, 2015, Prime Minister Stephen Harper announced that his government would impose a moratorium on further Senate appointments, intending to pressure the provinces into reaching a compromise on Senate reform.

Three days later, Vancouver lawyer Mr. Alani filed an application for judicial review of the Prime Minister’s decision, arguing that it was unconstitutional. During cross-examination, Mr. Alani acknowledged that he had no personal interest in becoming a Senator and no involvement in the Senate’s affairs. In response, the Attorney General contended that Mr. Alani lacked both direct and public interest standing.

**Issue:**

Does Mr. Alani have public interest standing to bring a judicial review application challenging the constitutionality of the Prime Minister’s decision to suspend Senate appointments?

**Rules and Analysis:**

In ***DESUAV***, the Supreme Court of Canada held that “there are occasions when public interest litigation is an appropriate vehicle to bring matters of public interest and importance before the courts” (para 22). The Court established three interrelated factors to determine public interest standing:

- the existence of a serious justiciable issue;
- the nature of the plaintiff’s interest; and
- whether the proposed proceeding is a reasonable and effective means of bringing the issue before the court.

**(1) Serious Justiciable Issue**

At paragraph 42 of ***DESUAV***, the Court stated that a “serious issue” must raise a substantial constitutional question or another issue of significant public importance.

Here, the Prime Minister’s announcement of a moratorium on Senate appointments directly engages section 32 of the *Constitution Act*, 1867 (30 & 31 Vict, c 3), which provides that “[w]hen a Vacancy happens in the Senate by Resignation, Death, or otherwise, the Governor General shall by Summons to a fit and qualified Person fill the Vacancy.” The legality of the government’s refusal to fill Senate vacancies is therefore a justiciable and serious constitutional issue.

**(2) Nature of the Plaintiff’s Interest**

At paragraph 43 of ***DESUAV***, the Court explained that this factor examines whether the plaintiff “has a real stake in the proceedings or is engaged with the issues they raise.” In ***Borowski***, the plaintiff was found to have a genuine interest as a concerned citizen and taxpayer who had attempted unsuccessfully to have the issue addressed through other means.

Although Mr. Alani is neither a Senator nor a potential appointee, he is a Canadian lawyer, citizen, and taxpayer who seeks to uphold constitutional compliance by the federal government. His concern over the government’s disregard for a constitutional duty demonstrates genuine engagement with the issue and a legitimate public interest.

**(3) Reasonable and Effective Means**

The third factor asks whether the proceeding constitutes, in all the circumstances, a reasonable and effective means of bringing the issue before the courts (***DESUAV***, para 52). The Court emphasized that this determination must be made flexibly and purposively, in light of the other factors.

As noted by **Macklem** and **Mathen**, *Canadian Constitutional Law*, 6th ed. (Toronto: Emond Montgomery Publications, 2022), at 9, “the judicial branch interprets and applies primary and subordinate legal rules, reviews the actions of state actors, and evaluates laws and state action for consistency with the Constitution.” Judicial review therefore represents a reasonable and effective mechanism for addressing an alleged constitutional breach where no directly affected party is likely to bring the claim.

**Summary:**

Mr. Alani meets all three ***DESUAV*** criteria and acts in good faith to uphold constitutional principles. His application raises a serious constitutional question, reflects a genuine and engaged public interest, and provides a reasonable and effective means for judicial oversight. Accordingly, Mr. Alani should be granted public interest standing.

## 4.1 Watertight Compartments

### Samantha

There are two rationales built into the *BNA Act* for dividing legislative power.  The following is a brief summary of their strengths and weaknesses that was written by **Prof. Robert Russo** who used to teach this class:

**Local/National rationale**

The strengths of this distinction lie in its apparent simplicity. In the 19th century, it was relatively easy to delineate between more immediate, local concerns of the provinces and larger national concerns of the emerging Canadian state.  Local works and undertakings were easy to understand in 1867.  Garbage collection was (and still mostly is) a local concern.  Alcohol selling establishments and regulation were a local concern of provinces.  Establishing hospitals, charities, asylums, administering justice were seen as a provincial responsibility.  By contrast, national responsibilities were then comparatively limited to defence and related matters, immigration, navigation, trade and dealing with indigenous population (Department of Indian Affairs). 

The weakness of this rationale is invariably rooted in the situation that existed in mid-19th century.  It doesn’t take into account how Canadian society has changed in context of globalization where even local matters can become national concerns.  For example, cannabis regulation is a provincial matter but the federal government has been very much involved in legalizing and establishing certain core standards.  The federal government assists provinces in administering justice in the province through various funding programs that help establish prison programs among other things.  And similarly, provinces’ have intruded into federal power over immigration and trade by establishing provincial ministries and programs dealing with provincial immigration employment and in establishing trade missions that operate in foreign countries to promote investment in their provinces.  Take a look at this BC Government website: [https://www.britishcolumbia.ca/global/trade-and-investment-representatives/](https://www.britishcolumbia.ca/global/trade-and-investment-representatives/){:target=" \_blank"}

Under the *BNA Act*, this would have sounded like an exclusive federal responsibility.  But obviously in today’s world, that’s not practical or even desirable, at least from a provincial point of view.  Finally, as the article notes, Quebec nationalism and the effects of dealing with this phenomenon have essentially made the original BNA local/national rationale even less relevant in 21st century Canada.

**Socio-Cultural/Economic Rationale**

This is an interesting distinction discussed by ***Norrie et al*** at 180-181.  Originally, the *BNA Act* contemplated a larger provincial role in promoting culture.  The strengths of this approach lie primarily again in its apparent simplicity but also in its ability to address lingering French/English tensions in the new Canadian union.  This would fit in well with the needs of Quebec, for example, and also serve to placate Ontario.  These were two giant provinces dominant in 19th century Canada (and, to a certain extent, still dominate today).  However, it also served to limit the development of a national Canadian culture, seen as critical for distinguishing the new Canadian state from it’s giant American counterpart to the south. 

Therefore, you see the types of national federal government intrusions in the cultural area cited in the article:  creation of the CBC, Canada Council for Arts.  The weakness of this development lies in its potential for abuse:  the Sponsorship Scandal of the late 1990s/early 2000s helped to bring down a federal Liberal government.

Provincial involvement in the economy has increased and with globalization this distinction is also being eroded.  However, I’d argue that **this distinction is a more durable explanation for division of federal/provincial powers**. The federal government must set monetary policy, must fund national defence.  Provinces do not have their own currency nor do they maintain armies.  Provinces maintain some responsibility for economic funding of education, social services and commercial regulation for property within respective provinces. 

The distinctive nature of this for Canada is the ability of the Canadian federation to resist overly centralizing pressures.  As the article notes, most federal systems existing for over a century have experienced extreme centralizing pressures in response to war, poverty, or other extreme economic conditions.  Some of you can probably cite examples from your own countries to this effect.  Canada has not been immune to this and indeed has seen considerable growth and incursions of federal power into many areas.  However, the unique nature of Canadian federalism has been its ability to preserve important provincial powers through cost-sharing programs, rather than transference of powers.  The federal government in Ottawa generally prefers to share responsibility in many areas with provinces rather than directly assuming control.  The article at p. 182 outlines the unique features of Canada in this regard.

Although my opinion is that the socio-cultural/economic rationale for dividing provincial/federal powers holds up more strongly, overall I’d agree with the article’s contention that the federal government’s powers have vastly expanded beyond what was originally contemplated in 1867.

### Answer

The term “watertight compartments,” coined by **Lord Atkin** in ***Canada (Attorney General) v Ontario (Attorney General)***, 1937 CanLII 362 (UK JCPC), serves as a metaphor to describe the distinct jurisdictions of the federal and provincial legislatures. In that case, the legal context of the argument was that their Lordships held that under sections 91 and 92 of the *Constitution Act*, 1867, the distribution of legislative powers is based on distinct classes of subjects assigned to each level of government. Accordingly, when a treaty with foreign countries concerns a particular subject matter, the level of legislature responsible for enacting domestic laws to implement that treaty depends entirely on the class of subject to which it belongs.

This ideology reflected the mindset of the framers of the Constitution and may have been suitable at the time. However, the evolution of Canadian society and the country’s expanding role in the international community, particularly in response to the challenges and opportunities following the Great Depression and the Second World War, have led to increasing overlap between federal and provincial jurisdictions. The once-clear boundaries of legislative competence have become progressively blurred, and the division is no longer as “watertight” as **Lord Atkin** once described.


The doctrine of constitutional interpretation must adapt to this reality. As **Lord Sankey LC** observed in ***Edwards v. Canada (Attorney General)***, 1929 CanLII 438 (UK JCPC), “**The *B.N.A. Act* planted in Canada a living tree capable of growth and expansion within its natural limits... Like all written constitutions, it has been subject to development through usage and convention**.” Consequently, no single rationale can provide a universal test for determining which matters properly fall within federal or provincial jurisdiction. Yet, guided by the “living tree” principle, the Constitution continues to provide broad but flexible boundaries within which both levels of government may exercise their powers.

## 4.2 Division of Powers

### Samantha

One mistake that I see student make over and over and over again in exams, is that they don't answer the specific question that is asked.  To give a student the maximum possible marks, they have to answer all the questions posed.

This Discussion Exercise is a good example:

> Important as the underlying values discussed by **Simeon** can be to the resolution by judges of the federalism disputes that come before them, it is rare for a judge to openly acknowledge that he or she has based a particular decision on one or more of those values.  Why do you suppose that is the case? Post your thoughts and comment on at least one other post.

The question being asked is: 

**Why is it rare for a judge to openly acknowledge that they have based a particular decision on one or more of [Simeon's] values?**

What I would invariably see on an exam, is for some students to start telling me all about Simeon's values, but never go on to address the question of **why judge's don't openly acknowledge them**.  It is great to cite what the values are and describe what they mean, as long as one then goes on to answer the question posed.

### Answer

The reason it is rare for a judge to openly advocate for one or more of the underlying values discussed by **Richard E. Simeon** in “*Criteria for Choice in Federal Systems*” is that these values are essentially neutral. They can be invoked to support either pro-federal or pro-provincial positions, depending on the perspective from which an argument is made.

**Simeon** identifies three key values: community, functional efficiency, and democracy.

- Community assesses federalism based on its capacity to preserve and balance both regional and national political communities.
- Functional efficiency focuses on the government’s ability to meet citizens’ needs effectively.
- Democracy emphasizes the protection of liberty and minority rights against oppression by the majority.

Each of these values can be used either to support or to challenge centralization.

For instance, from the standpoint of functional efficiency, one could argue that a decentralized federal system is inherently incapable of handling the growing responsibilities imposed by economic and social developments, especially during and after the Second World War, when Canada faced significant national challenges. However, by the 1980s, once key frameworks for economic management had been firmly established, attention shifted toward the drawbacks of centralization and the virtues of decentralization. The limitations of highly centralized policies, particularly for certain regions, became increasingly apparent.

The same reasoning applies to the values of community and democracy. From a community perspective, federalism represents a dynamic balance between regional and national identities, often shaped by competing forces such as nation-building, province-building, or Quebec’s pursuit of nationhood.

As for democracy, many view it as best served through substantial decentralization. Divided jurisdictions and competing governments create greater opportunities for citizen participation and safeguard minorities from the “tyranny of the majority.” Yet this comes with trade-offs: system responsiveness and system capacity are often inversely related. In protecting minorities, decentralization may sometimes lead to the frustration of majorities.

## 4.4 National Concern

### Samantha

Note that the National Concern Doctrine falls under the **Residual Theory** of the **POGG** Power.  

This Residual Theory has three branches:

- (1) **The Gap Branch:** Gives federal parliament the power to fill gaps in the scheme of distribution of powers;

- (2) **The National Concern Branch:** Gives Federal Parliament over distinct subject matter which does not fall within any of the provincial classifications of power under s. 92 and which, by nature, are of national concern; and

- (3) **The Emergency Branch:** Gives Federal Parliament temporary jurisdiction over all subject matter that is rationally connected to helping deal with the emergency.

The national concern doctrine applies to both new matters which did not exist at Confederation and to matters which, although originally matters of local concern, have since, in the absence of national emergency, become matters of national concern. 

For matters to qualify as an matter of national concern in either sense, it must have a singleness, distinctiveness, and indivisibility that clearly distinguishes if from matters of provincial concerns, and a scale of impact on provincial jurisdiction that is reconcilable with the fundamental distribution of legislative power under the constitution.

In order to attain whether a matter has the required degree of **singleness**, **distinctiveness** and **indivisibility** that clearly distinguishes it from matters of provincial concern it is relevant to consider what would be the effect on the extra-provincial interests of a provincial failure to deal with the control or regulation of the intra-provincial aspects of the matter more effectively. 

This brief article is a good summary of the **POGG** power:  [https://www.constitutionalstudies.ca/2019/07/peace-order-and-good-government/](https://www.constitutionalstudies.ca/2019/07/peace-order-and-good-government/){:target=" \_blank"}

### Answer

The general idea of the EU’s **doctrine of subsidiarity** is that, in a federal state, powers should be distributed between the central and regional governments according to the principle that decisions ought to be made at the lowest level of government reasonably possible.

The **national concern** doctrine, by contrast, supports the residual power theory in Canada’s federal division of powers. As the Supreme Court held in ***Re: Anti-Inflation Act***, 1976 CanLII 16 (SCC), the national concern branch can justify federal intervention in areas normally within provincial jurisdiction by invoking Parliament’s power to make laws for the “**peace, order, and good government of Canada**” (**POGG**) under Section 91 of the *Constitution Act*, 1867. Importantly, the doctrine applies only where the matter is genuinely new, or where a subject that was originally provincial has, through social or technological change, acquired national dimensions that make provincial regulation inadequate.

Both doctrines address the allocation and reconciliation of federal and local powers, but they do so from quite different perspectives.

To begin with, they originate from opposite premises. The doctrine of subsidiarity emphasizes local autonomy: only matters that cannot be reasonably managed at the local level should fall within federal authority. Conversely, the national concern doctrine was developed to empower the federal government to legislate on matters that do not fit neatly within either federal or provincial heads of power under the Constitution.

Differences also emerge in their application. There is debate as to whether the “reasonably possible” standard under subsidiarity refers solely to the inability of lower levels of government, or whether it also encompasses the efficacy of their actions. Under the former interpretation, more powers would remain with local authorities; under the latter, the federal government would assume a broader role.

In Canada, however, the judiciary has approached this issue with caution. As society evolves, more matters could arguably qualify as of national concern, potentially expanding federal authority at the expense of provincial autonomy.

To prevent such overreach, **Justice Le Dain** in ***R. v. Crown Zellerbach Canada Ltd.***, 1988 CanLII 63 (SCC), proposed what became known as the “**provincial inability**” test. Essentially, the test asks whether a province’s failure to effectively regulate or control an intra-provincial matter would have adverse effects on extra-provincial interests. This test, together with other considerations such as the national significance, singleness, distinctiveness, and indivisibility of a matter, serves as an important safeguard for Canadian federalism.

## 4.6 Operability Fact Pattern

### Samantha

There are 3 main approaches or considerations when it comes to Federalism issues such as this one.  These are to consider the problem from the perspectives of:

- Validity

- Operability, and

- Applicability

Validity can be assessed by applying a **Pith & Substance** analysis.  This will involve looking at the 

- (1) Characterization of the law (purpose and effect), then 
- (2) its Classification.

Where there are conflicts, we can consider Operability (**Doctrine of Paramountcy**) and Applicability (**Inter-JD Immunity**) to try and sort through the law's overall application.

### Answer

**Conclusion:**

Vancouver’s “*Marijuana By-Law*” is valid because it forms part of the city’s zoning and development framework, which lies within provincial jurisdiction. However, the provisions authorizing and licensing marijuana storefronts and dispensaries directly conflict with the federal regulatory scheme governing cannabis distribution and should therefore be held inoperable under the doctrine of federal paramountcy.

**Facts:**

The *Controlled Drugs and Substances Act*, SC 1996, c 19 (“***CDSA***”), and the *Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations*, SOR/2013-119 (“***MMPR***”), prohibited the operation of marijuana storefronts. Section 122 of the ***MMPR*** provided that 

> a licensed producer must not transfer physical possession of the dried marijuana to the client or to an individual responsible for that client other than by shipping it to that person.

Thus, dispensaries were not permitted under federal law.

On June 24, 2015, the Vancouver City Council amended its *Zoning and Development By-Law* to include provisions for licensing and regulating medical marijuana dispensaries. The ***By-Law*** required dispensaries to apply for a business license and satisfy several zoning and operational conditions.

A dispensary that failed to comply challenged the validity and operability of the ***By-Law***, arguing that it conflicted with federal law and was therefore inoperative.

**Legal Issues:**

- Whether the Vancouver ***By-Law*** is valid.
- If valid, whether it is applicable and operable given the federal framework.

**Rules and Application:**

***Validity:***

The Supreme Court of Canada’s general approach to questions of validity in the federalism context was summarized by **Wagner CJ** in ***References re Greenhouse Gas Pollution Pricing Act***, 2021 SCC 11:

> [47] ...the well-established two-stage analytical approach to the review of legislation on federalism grounds: ***Reference re Pan-Canadian Securities Regulation***, 2018 SCC 48, [2018] 3 S.C.R. 189 (“***2018 Securities Reference***”), at para. 86. I will first consider the purpose and effects of the ***GGPPA*** with a view to characterizing the subject matter — the **pith and substance** — of the statute. Then I will classify the subject matter of the ***GGPPA*** with reference to federal and provincial heads of power under the Constitution in order to determine whether it is *intra vires* Parliament and therefore valid.

To identify the “pith and substance” of a law, we can examine its leading feature or true character. In ***R. v. Morgentaler***, 1993 CanLII 74, the Court articulated,

> A law's "matter" is its leading feature or true character, often described as its pith and substance. While both the purpose and effect of the law are relevant considerations in the process of characterization, ...it is often the case that the legislation's dominant purpose or aim is the key to constitutional validity.

However, while a law may be valid in its overall purpose, certain provisions within it may nevertheless be challenged for encroaching upon the jurisdiction of the other level of government. The Supreme Court gave its approach to address this issue in ***General Motors of Canada Ltd. v. City National Leasing***, 1989 CanLII 133 (SCC),

> The steps in the analysis may be summarized as follows: First, the court must determine whether the impugned provision can be viewed as intruding on provincial powers, and if so to what extent. Second, the court must establish whether the act (or a severable part of it) is valid; ... If the scheme is not valid, that is the end of the inquiry.  If the scheme of regulation is declared valid, the court must then determine whether the impugned provision is sufficiently integrated with the scheme that it can be upheld by virtue of that relationship.

Zoning and development related to a city’s planning fall under provincial jurisdiction and are readily classified within provincial legislative authority under s. 92(16) of the *Constitution Act*, 1867, which covers “Generally all Matters of a merely local or private Nature in the Province.” Thus, the dominant purpose or aim of Vancouver’s ***By-Law*** places it squarely within provincial authority.

The contested provisions concern the licensing, regulation, and fines applicable to marijuana dispensaries. While these measures stem from the city’s responsibility to oversee business zoning, they nevertheless extend into aspects of the operation of marijuana-related businesses, an area that overlaps with the federal criminal law domain. However, these provisions are closely and functionally integrated with the broader zoning and development objectives of the ***By-Law***. Accordingly, the ***By-Law*** as a whole should be upheld as valid.

***Applicability & Operability***

Even if a law is validly enacted, it may still be rendered inapplicable in certain circumstances to protect the core of the other level of government’s jurisdiction. This principle is known as the doctrine of **inter-jurisdictional immunity**.

However, the application of this doctrine must be approached with caution. While criminal law falls exclusively within federal jurisdiction, this does not preclude provincial legislatures from enacting regulatory or penal provisions that incidentally relate to the same subject matter, provided their dominant purpose remains within provincial competence.

The court in ***Canada (AG) v PHS Community Services Society***, 2011 SCC 44, at paras 61-64 warned,

> [61] Recent jurisprudence has tended to confine the doctrine of inter-jurisdictional immunity. …the doctrine “has not been removed from the federalism analysis”, but rather remains “in a form constrained by principle and precedent”

> [62] This caution reflects three related concerns.  First, the doctrine of inter-jurisdictional immunity is in tension with the dominant approach that permits concurrent federal and provincial legislation with respect to a matter…

> [63] Second, the doctrine is in tension with the emergent practice of cooperative federalism, which increasingly features interlocking federal and provincial legislative schemes.

> [64] Third, the doctrine of inter-jurisdictional immunity may overshoot the federal or provincial power in which it is grounded and create legislative “no go” zones where neither level of government regulates.

As a result, while the ***By-Law*** and the federal ***CDSA*** and ***MMPR*** are all valid within the broader criminal law sphere, the key question becomes not their coexistence, nor applicability, but the operability of the ***By-Law*** in light of potential conflict with federal legislation.

In ***Rothmans, Benson & Hedges Inc. v. Saskatchewan***, 2005 SCC 13 (CanLII), the Supreme Court explained the **federal paramountcy** doctrine,

> [11] The doctrine of federal legislative paramountcy dictates that where there is an inconsistency between validly enacted but overlapping provincial and federal legislation, the provincial legislation is inoperative to the extent of the inconsistency.

For a precise definition of “conflict,” or “inconsistency” as referred to in the above case, the court in ***Bank of Montreal v. Hall***, 1990 CanLII 157 (SCC) explained,

> turned to the question whether the doctrine of paramountcy applied so as to suspend the provincial legislation or render it inoperative.  ...by application of the test for paramountcy laid down by this Court in ***Multiple Access Ltd. v. McCutcheon***, 1982 CanLII 55 (SCC), [1982] 2 S.C.R. 161, at p. 40:
>   
> Paramountcy applies only where there is actual conflict in operation as where one enactment says "yes", the other "no", or compliance with one is defiance of the other. 

The Court further explained that federal paramountcy dominates when 

> dual compliance will be impossible when application of the provincial statute can fairly be said to frustrate Parliament's legislative purpose.

On March 31, 2014, the federal government repealed the *Marihuana Medical Access Regulations* (***MMAR***) and replaced them with the *Marihuana for Medical Purposes Regulations*, SOR/2013-119 (“***MMPR***”). Section 122 of the ***MMPR*** provided that, in filling client orders, “a licensed producer must not transfer physical possession of the dried marijuana to the client or to an individual responsible for that client other than by shipping it to that person.” In other words, the ***MMPR*** expressly prohibited the establishment of storefront marijuana stores or “dispensaries.” Instead, section 73 stipulated that the only lawful method for licensed producers to supply marijuana to registered clients was through mail-order delivery.

In contrast, the Vancouver ***By-Law***, enacted on June 24, 2015, authorized the licensing of marijuana dispensaries that complied with its local regulatory requirements, thereby permitting an operation explicitly prohibited under the ***MMPR***.

Consequently, the two levels of legislation are in operational conflict: compliance with one necessarily entails defiance of the other. 

The municipal ***By-Law*** undermines the purpose of the federal regulatory scheme, which sought to maintain exclusive control over the distribution of medical marijuana. Under the doctrine of federal paramountcy, the ***By-Law*** is therefore inoperable to the extent of this conflict.

**Summary:**

Vancouver’s Marijuana ***By-Law*** is valid in its overall purpose, as it primarily regulates zoning and development, a matter within provincial jurisdiction. Its licensing provisions, though touching federally regulated activities, are integrated with the ***By-Law***’s broader municipal objectives and do not render it invalid.

However, these provisions conflict directly with federal law, which prohibits storefront distribution of medical marijuana. Under the doctrine of federal paramountcy, the ***By-Law*** is inoperable to the extent of this conflict, while its zoning and development regulations remain valid and enforceable.
