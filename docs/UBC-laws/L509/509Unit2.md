#  The Rule of Law

## 2.0 Overview

the basic concept of the rule of law: it is supposed to ensure that law limits the arbitrary exercise of power.  

As we’ve reviewed in the previous module, the expansion of executive powers through delegation, combined with the vagueness of statutory instruments, creates some challenges in limiting the exercise of administrative power. 


## 2.1 The Rule of Law: Arbitrariness & Legality

!!! note "Read"

    - *Canada (Attorney General) v. PHS Community Services Society*, [2011 SCC 44](https://canlii.ca/t/fn9cf){:target=" \_blank"}
    - Questions:
        - Do these decisions improve the lives of Canadians or made them more difficult? 
        - Where do administrative decisions derive their legitimacy in the public eye?
        - What limits the scope of administrative decision-makers?

The rule of law protects individuals from the arbitrary exercise of public power and, at a minimum, the rule of law means:

- that administrative decision-makers are **bound by law**; and
- that those who are subject to an administrative decision have some means of **legal recourse** to ensure that the decision complied with the law.


The Constitution is the supreme law of Canada and the **rule of law** is explicitly recognized in the preamble of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*, which is found in the *Constitution Act*, 1982:

<p class="highlight blue">Whereas Canada is founded upon principles that recognize the supremacy of God and the rule of law.</p>


Rule of law doesn’t necessarily mean that courts (or tribunals) are supreme over all legal issues.  In Canada, we have an independent Parliament, that is “sovereign” over all other government institutions, including executive and judicial bodies.  This is the concept of **parliamentary sovereignty**.  

So remember that the rule of law, when seen through this lens of parliamentary sovereignty, allows for Parliament to assign at least some legal questions to bodies other than the courts.

In general, adherence to the rule of law particularly in the field of administrative law helps to protect Canadians from abuses of state power. In this way, the rule of law helps to secure Canadians’ legal rights, and protection from arbitrary decision-making.
