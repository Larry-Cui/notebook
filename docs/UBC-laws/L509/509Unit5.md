# Accessing Administrative Justice

## 5.0 Overview

Individual and group rights are affected by administrative decision-makers through policies and decisions. Procedural fairness is incredibly important in the context of safeguarding **rights** in administrative law, however accessing those rights become moot if the public cannot access administrative justice **procedures**.

The constraints on accessing administrative justice are many and include **financial constraints**, **time-consuming processes** and often the **complexity** of the process and **uncertain chances of success**.

## 5.1 Principle of access to justice/access to remedy

The concept of “fairness” in this area is broken into several components in the textbook. In this Module, we focus on three issues relating to access to administrative justice.

**1. Standing**

In Canadian administrative law, standing or *locus standi* refers to the ability of someone challenging an administrative decision to prove to the court **sufficient connection and harm** from the administrative decision that would support that party's participation in the case. 

The issue of standing doesn’t arise in most judicial review cases since the individual challenging the decision is usually the main target of the decision. Further, in Canada **standing to challenge administrative decisions** is generally **governed by the terms of an enabling statute**, which can be narrow or broad.

**Public interest standing** in Canada is available in Constitutional and non-Constitutional cases.  We are focusing in this topic on non-Constitutional cases. Standing issues can arise through common-law and statutory challenges in two broad ways:

- (1) An administrative decision may affect a large section of the public without specifically targeting a single individual; and
- (2) An administrative decision may affect broad interests in unique ways and someone other than a targeted individual applies for judicial review.

***Finlay*** is the Supreme Court of Canada case that **extended** the domain of public interest standing from a **constitutional** to a general **administrative** law basis.  

In ***Finlay***, the Supreme Court of Canada adopted the reasoning in its previous decision ***Thorson v. Attorney General of Canada***, [1974 CanLII 6 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1twxf){:target=" \_blank"} to justify the **recognition of public interest standing in purely administrative law cases**. The SCC held that courts should have discretion to recognize the standing of a public interest litigant.   

The main considerations in analyzing this are:

- (a) whether or not there is a **justiciable issue**, reflecting "concern about the proper role of the courts and their constitutional relationship with the other branches of government."
- (b) whether or not the challenge involves a **serious issue** raised by someone with a "genuine" interest in its determination, reflecting a "concern about the allocation of scarce judicial resources and the need to screen out the mere busybody."
- (c) whether or not there is any other "**reasonable and effective manner** in which the issue may be brought before a court", reflecting the concern that the "courts should have the benefit of the contending points of view by those most directly affected by them."

**2. Communication (Language)**

There are constitutional guarantees for availability of language interpretation for certain areas of law, under Section 14 of the Charter (such as in criminal cases), however in the administrative law context, the situation is quite different.  Courts often **defer to administrative** tribunals and their discretion in determining the availability of translation services and information availability in different languages.

The case excerpt of ***Filgueira*** deals with the issue of **language and accessibility** relating to information about administrative decision-making services.  It also touches on some difficult issues such as the financial implications and responsibility for who pays for the production of language translation services and related information.  

**3. Financial Costs**

Too much emphasis on procedures can compromise other values that are important in delivering government services and programs. There is the possibility of delaying important government decisions that might prejudice the public interest. In addition, administrative process such as holding hearings can cost more money to both the administrative agency and participants. The inherent delays in some hearings may render the ultimate outcome more costly.

The financial stresses put on individual claimants during an administrative law process is a growing concern for the Canadian legal community. One of the responses, at the provincial level, has been for greater power and discretion afforded to administrative tribunals to develop their own costs schemes. 

As the text notes at p. 366, [s. 47(1) of the *B.C. Administrative Tribunals Act*](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/04045_01#section47){:target=" \_blank"} allows for B.C. administrative tribunals to develop their own cost schemes.  Note that while s. 47(1) says “Subject to the regulations” no such regulations have been enacted.

The decision of the **BC Farm Industry Review Board** in *B.C. Vegetable Greenhouse v BC Vegetable Marketing Commission* considers with this complex issue.  As you read the decision, note the Review Board’s consideration that **administrative tribunals have no inherent power to award costs**, and that **the power to award costs must be found either expressly or by implication in a tribunal’s enabling statute**.
