# Standard of Review.

## 7.0 Overview

The landmark case in the choice and application of the standard of review in Canada is the 2019 decision of ***Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov***, [2019 SCC 65](https://canlii.ca/t/j46kb){:target=" \_blank"}.

A very quick and brief reminder on the two current standards of reviewing an administrative decision:

- **Reasonableness**: is the **more deferential** standard that a court can give to an administrative decision-maker based on expertise of the decision-maker. A decision must be shown to be “unreasonable” in the sense that no reasons are given in analysis to reasonably support the conclusion.  Following the ***Vavilov*** decision it is clearly the presumptive (i.e. “default”) standard of reviewing administrative decisions, including ones that involve **jurisdictional questions of a administrative decision-maker exceeding their statutory authority**.
- **Correctness**: is the **less deferential** standard that a court can give to an administrative decision-maker. The court will generally give no deference at all to the decision-maker, will base its ruling on application of law, and can substitute its own opinion for the administrative decision-maker.  Correctness review applies in certain statutorily directed situations and other exceptional situations outlined in ***Vavilov***.

In 1979, the SCC in ***C.U.P.E. v. N.B. Liquor Corporation***, [1979 CanLII 23 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1mm2x){:target=" \_blank"} charted a new course that encouraged courts to defer to administrative decision-makers who provided reasonable answers to legal questions within their mandates.

Generally, the basic starting point for the standard of review of an administrative process is that it does NOT involve a total reassessment of the merits of a decision. There are some exceptions to reasonableness review, now outlined in ***Vavilov***, that will attract correctness review.   

As we will see in the 2019 ***Vavilvov*** decision, the SCC relegated **jurisdictional questions** (other than overlapping jurisdiction) to **reasonableness** review.  However, the “language of jurisdiction” lives on and understanding the concept of jurisdiction is still fundamentally important to provide context for a deeper study into applicable standards of review in Canadian administrative law. 

The "Blockbuster" case: ***CUPE***

***CUPE*** dealt with many issues, including statutory interpretation and the extent of deference to be shown to administrative tribunals in areas of their expertise.

The case is summarized in text. Read the case as a good historical explanation of theory and principle and **less for its current precedential value**.

#### <p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">Textbook Summary</p>

In administrative law doctrine, the standard of review inquiry proceeds in two steps. First, should the court defer? Second, if the answer is yes, how does the court defer.

The **jurisprudence has been volatile**, and the Supreme Court of Canada has hit the “reset” button several times. It did so in 1979 (***CUPE***), 1998 (***Pushpanathan v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)***, [1998 CanLII 778 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fqs6){:target=" \_blank"}), and again in 2008 (***Dunsmuir v. New Brunswick***, [2008 SCC 9](https://canlii.ca/t/1vxsm){:target=" \_blank"}) before the latest revision in ***Vavilov*** (2019).

Judicial review is ordinarily available for breaches of procedural fairness, errors of law, abuse of discretion, or factual findings made in the absence of evidence. 

So-called **privative clauses** were originally intended to prevent courts from interfering with substantive outcomes of administrative action through the doctrines of error of law or absence of evidence for findings of fact. Privative clauses vary in wording but usually include **a grant of exclusive jurisdiction** over the subject matter, **a declaration of finality** with respect to the outcome, and **a prohibition on any court proceedings** to set the outcome aside.

On the one hand, the common law presumes that citizens retain access to the ordinary courts in order to ensure that creatures of statute do not exceed or abuse the power granted to them. The Supreme Court of Canada even elevated judicial review to a constitutionally protected principle under s 96 of the *Constitution Act*, 1867.

On the other hand, the doctrine of parliamentary supremacy dictates that the legislator enacts the law, and the court must interpret and apply the law in accordance with the legislator’s intent.

the House of Lords’ ***Anisminic Ltd v Foreign Compensation Commission***, [1969] 2 AC 147 (HL) case: decision-makers’ jurisdiction (authority to act) is demarcated by statute. 

Judges faced with a privative clause assigned themselves the task of determining whether the issue fell “within jurisdiction” and was thereby insulated from judicial review, **OR** was a “jurisdictional question” that determined the outer boundary of the decision-maker’s authority. 

In a case of the **latter**, a court was entitled to review the decision as if **no privative clause existed**.

The most enduring effect of this jurisprudence was the persistence of the concept of a “jurisdictional question,” long after standard of review doctrine evolved to a point where **a “jurisdictional question” was no longer required to justify judicial review** in the face of a privative clause.

***CUPE V NEW BRUNSWICK LIQUOR CORPORATION***

The shorthand description of ***CUPE***’s outcome is that a jurisdictional question is assessed according to a standard of “**correctness**,” while questions within jurisdiction are evaluated against a standard of “**patent unreasonableness**.”

The Court’s judgment in ***CUPE*** did not make a clean break with earlier jurisprudence that invoked jurisdictional error to circumvent privative clauses. It conveyed a spirit of curial deference, a recognition that administrative decision-makers are not merely “inferior tribunals” but specialized bodies that possess a legislative mandate to apply their expertise and experience to matters that they may be better suited to address than an “ordinary court.” 

Consequently, a court should only intervene (by labelling as jurisdictional error) where an interpretation of the provision is “so patently unreasonable that its construction cannot be rationally supported by the relevant legislation.”

A reading of ***CUPE*** reveals three sources of the Supreme Court of Canada’s doctrinal change. 

- First, ... according to Dickson J, courts should recognize that these specialized decision-makers bear primary responsibility for implementing their statutory mandate and may bring valuable expertise and experience to the task that a generalist judge lacks. 
- Second, no single interpretation could lay claim to being “correct.” Instead, there were several plausible interpretations.
- Finally, Dickson J acknowledges the failure of prior judicial efforts to construct a coherent, principled means of distinguishing reviewable questions from those insulated by a privative clause.

## 7.2 Concept of Curial Deference

    - ***B.C. (Health sciences Assn. of) v. British Columbia (Industrial Relations Council)***, [1992 CanLII 373 (BC CA)](https://canlii.ca/t/1d9fb){:target=" \_blank"} at paras 33-34
        - The term “**Curial deference**” is a way of expressing the notion that when the Legislature sets up a specialized tribunal, invests it with broad powers and incorporates a privative clause into the enabling statute, it is telling the courts that it intends the tribunal to have the right, because it understands the subject-matter better than do judges, to make decisions which the judges might think to be wrong decisions.
        - To put it another way, where, by the terms of its legislation, the Legislature requires **curial deference**, the courts are bound, where no constitutional question arises, to obey the Legislature and not subvert its intention.
    - ***Vavilov***, at para 286
        - **Curial deference**, after all, is the hallmark of **reasonableness review**, setting it apart from the substitution of opinion permitted under the correctness standard.

You should note that there are many past SCC decisions that recognize that privative clauses were relevant indicators of legislative intent and attracted increase judicial deference to an administrative decision-maker.  **This is something that may have changed with the SCC’s “recalibration” of standard of review in *Vavilov*.**  

In the ***Vavilov*** framework, privative clauses by themselves do not seem particularly relevant in choosing a standard of review.  Absent a clear statutory avenue of appeal or other statutory language, or the presence of one of the exceptions outlined in ***Vavilov***, **a presumption of reasonableness review will now apply** whether or not there is a privative clause in an administrative decision-maker’s home statute.
