# Standard of Review.

## 7.0 Overview

The landmark case in the choice and application of the standard of review in Canada is the 2019 decision of ***Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov***, [2019 SCC 65](https://canlii.ca/t/j46kb){:target=" \_blank"}.

A very quick and brief reminder on the two current standards of reviewing an administrative decision:

- **Reasonableness**: is the **more deferential** standard that a court can give to an administrative decision-maker based on expertise of the decision-maker. A decision must be shown to be “unreasonable” in the sense that no reasons are given in analysis to reasonably support the conclusion.  Following the ***Vavilov*** decision it is clearly the presumptive (i.e. “default”) standard of reviewing administrative decisions, including ones that involve **jurisdictional questions of a administrative decision-maker exceeding their statutory authority**.
- **Correctness**: is the **less deferential** standard that a court can give to an administrative decision-maker. The court will generally give no deference at all to the decision-maker, will base its ruling on application of law, and can substitute its own opinion for the administrative decision-maker.  Correctness review applies in certain statutorily directed situations and other exceptional situations outlined in ***Vavilov***.

In 1979, the SCC in ***C.U.P.E. v. N.B. Liquor Corporation***, [1979 CanLII 23 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1mm2x){:target=" \_blank"} charted a new course that encouraged courts to defer to administrative decision-makers who provided reasonable answers to legal questions within their mandates.

Generally, the basic starting point for the standard of review of an administrative process is that it does NOT involve a total reassessment of the merits of a decision. There are some exceptions to reasonableness review, now outlined in ***Vavilov***, that will attract correctness review.   

As we will see in the 2019 ***Vavilvov*** decision, the SCC relegated **jurisdictional questions** (other than overlapping jurisdiction) to **reasonableness** review.  However, the “language of jurisdiction” lives on and understanding the concept of jurisdiction is still fundamentally important to provide context for a deeper study into applicable standards of review in Canadian administrative law. 

The "Blockbuster" case: ***CUPE***

***CUPE*** dealt with many issues, including statutory interpretation and the extent of deference to be shown to administrative tribunals in areas of their expertise.

The case is summarized in text. Read the case as a good historical explanation of theory and principle and **less for its current precedential value**.
