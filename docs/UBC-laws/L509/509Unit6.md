# Bias and Independence

## 6.0 Overview

In Latin, the phrase ***nemo judex in sua causa debet esse***  [“no one should be a judge in her or his own cause"] refers directly to cases where a decision-maker has a direct stake in the outcome of the proceedings.    However, concerns with **bias** going beyond financial interests to include attitudes and relationships to both the parties and the relevant issues at stake.  

Issues of **bias** can arise from an attitude or relationship that creates misgivings as to whether the decision maker will approach and determine the matters in issue in an objective way without concerns related to any self-interest. 

**Independence** arguments, by contrast, have appeared in Canada as a separate ground for challenging administrative decisions.  Section 11(h) of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* specifically refers to a requirement of an “independent and impartial tribunal” in the criminal context, but this has provided some guidance in administrative processes as well.  

**Independence**, or **lack of independence**, has become a basis for challenging administrative decisions and procedures where decision-makers’ independence is in issue.

**Bias:** the action of supporting or opposing a particular person or thing in an **unfair** way, because of allowing **personal opinions to influence your judgment**.

**Judicial Independence:** Judicial independence has many definitions, but ultimately it means that judicial officers of the Court have the **freedom to decide each case on its own merits**, without interference or influence of any kind from any source, including another branch of government.

In Canada, the sources of an impartial and independent decision-maker originate from the **common law**. There is also the argument that an independent and impartial tribunal is guaranteed through unwritten **constitutional principles** and the **rule of law**.  This was the situation in the ***Ocean Port Hotel*** case.

In ***Ocean Port***, the court was concerned with members of the province's Liquor Appeal Board who, under the enabling statute, served at the pleasure of the lieutenant governor in council. The B.C. Court of Appeal considered the severity of the economic consequences of a licence suspension that could be imposed on licensees for infringement of the licensing laws.  The Court of Appeal held that the degree of independence possessed by members of the tribunal should approach that expected of a court at common law. Seen in those terms, the tenuous nature of the members' appointments was insufficient to satisfy **the security of tenure aspects of the independence** requirements and the Court of Appeal ruled in favour of Ocean Port. 

The Supreme Court of Canada **reversed** that decision, holding that members of the B.C. Liquor Appeal Board are sufficiently independent to render decisions on violations of the Act and impose the penalties it provides.

#### <p class="highlight yellow" markdown="1">Textbook Summary</p>

Key characteristics of a fair proceeding are that the decision-maker (and the process itself) not grant undue preferential or adverse treatment nor be driven by preconceived notions.

Consequently, regardless of what the reality may be in any given administrative decision-making process, the mere **perception of partiality** toward a particular outcome, or *bias*, provided that the perception is reasonable, is **enough** to have a decision overturned. 

At common law, the **principles of natural justice** are encapsulated in two central ideas. 

- The first is that a decision-maker should neither judge their own cause nor have any interest in the outcome of a case they are deciding. This idea is generally known as the rule against bias and is often summarized in the Latin maxim ***nemo judex in sua causa debet esse*** (“no one is fit to be the judge in their own cause”). 
- The second idea requires the decision-maker to hear and listen to both sides of the case before making a decision. This requirement has been summarized by the maxim ***audi alteram partem*** (“hear the other side”).

A determination by an independent and impartial tribunal is guaranteed in some cases through the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms*. **What** is not always clear, however, is what specific situations **trigger** guarantees of independence and impartiality from administrative bodies or **how** the administrative bodies need to be construed or operated in order to **show** that they are independent and impartial.

By design, administrative decision-making bodies in Canada have been created in a way that leaves them connected to government.

Given the close relationship in Canada between the executive branch of governments and the administrative agencies they appoint, one can easily see how members of the general public may be wary of inappropriate interference in administrative decision-making.

The jurisprudence on tribunal independence in Canada has developed in three waves:

- The **first** wave of jurisprudence used the **independence of the judiciary** as a foundation on which to mould the concept of administrative tribunal independence. 
- The **second** wave, marked by the decision in ***Ocean Port***, affirmed the **hybrid nature** of tribunals and maintained that there is no general constitutional guarantee of independence where tribunals are concerned. 
- The **third** wave served as a retrenchment: litigants once again pushed to have judicial declarations that administrative tribunal independence is **guaranteed by the Constitution**. 

Referenced briefly in the Supreme Court’s decision in ***The Queen v. Beauregard***, [1986 CanLII 24 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fts8){:target=" \_blank"}, the **concept of adjudicative independence** embodies the ability of a decision-maker to decide, **free of inappropriate interference** by other decision-makers.

Unlike security of tenure, financial security, and administrative control, adjudicative independence is **not structural in nature**.

The purpose of judicial independence is to help boost **public confidence** in the justice system: it is for the protection of the public, not the protection of the judges. The independence of administrative tribunals seeks to achieve the **same goal** while also allowing tribunal members to use their expertise and analytical capacities to reach the best decisions. 

Over the years, the **test** for adequate tribunal independence has developed to be whether a reasonable, well-informed person having thought the matter through would conclude that an administrative decision-maker is sufficiently free of factors that could interfere with his or her ability to make impartial judgments. This test, is generally referred to as the “**reasonable apprehension of bias**” test.

In many cases, the objective guarantees of independence for the judiciary **do not meet** anything near a complete match for tribunals.

The issue of whether **“at pleasure” appointments** fail to provide adequate guarantees of independence from arbitrary interference by the executive branch of government was addressed in ***Ocean Port***. It was not resolved, however, as the 2009 case of ***Keen v. Canada (Attorney General)***, [2009 FC 353](https://canlii.ca/t/2344s){:target=" \_blank"} demonstrates. For more than one reason, ***Ocean Port*** forms a turning point in the jurisprudence on the independence of administrative tribunals.

**Ocean Port**

The Supreme Court disagreed the unwritten constitutional principle guaranteeing judicial independence should be interpreted to extend to administrative tribunals as well.

Tribunals are created precisely for the purpose of implementing the policies of the executive branch of government. The Court held that because constitutional guarantees of independence serve primarily to protect the judiciary from interference by the executive, they cannot work to protect tribunals from the branch of government of which they are a part.

It is up to **Parliament or the legislature to determine** the structure, responsibilities, and degree of independence required of any particular tribunal. 

Furthermore, the Supreme Court reminded us that tribunal independence is a **common law principle** of natural justice. As with all principles of natural justice, the degree of independence required at common law **could be ousted** by express statutory language or necessary statutory implication, so long as the statute is constitutionally valid. 

The only way that constitutional or constitution-like protections can be afforded to a tribunal is if the actions of the particular tribunal **trigger the protections offered by the Canadian *Charter*** or by one of the provincial or federal quasi-constitutional statutes.

**Keen v Canada**

***Ocean Port*** affirmed that a variety of tribunal appointments can satisfy the requirement of security of tenure so long as there are no constitutional standards at play and the terms of the appointment derive from constitutionally valid legislation. However, cases such as ***Keen*** show that, as a practical reality, governments still can, and do, interfere with administrative decision-making because of improper understandings about tribunal accountability.

The **third wave** of tribunal independence jurisprudence is marked by litigants reasserting a push for tribunals to have the same independence as courts.

Decided shortly after ***Ocean Port***, ***Bell Canada v. Canadian Telephone Employees Association***, [2003 SCC 36](https://canlii.ca/t/1g6pk){:target=" \_blank"} had suggested a spectrum of decision-making types in which highly adjudicative tribunals endowed with court-like powers and procedures could require more stringent requirements of procedural fairness, including a higher degree of independence.

In the 2006 BC Supreme Court decision in ***McKenzie v. Minister of Public Safety and Solicitor General et al.***, [2006 BCSC 1372](https://canlii.ca/t/1p8sw){:target=" \_blank"}, agreed with the petitioner that the unwritten constitutional guarantees of independence should be expanded to apply to residential tenancy arbitrators.


## 6.1 Practice Quiz

1. In ***Ocean Port***, the Supreme Court of Canada held that the appointment scheme of the Liquor Appeal Board:

    - [x] Was clearly what the legislature intended
