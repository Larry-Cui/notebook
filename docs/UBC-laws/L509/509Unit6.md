# Bias and Independence

## 6.0 Overview

In Latin, the phrase *nemo judex in sua causa debet esse*  [“no one should be a judge in her or his own cause"] refers directly to cases where a decision-maker has a direct stake in the outcome of the proceedings.    However, concerns with **bias** going beyond financial interests to include attitudes and relationships to both the parties and the relevant issues at stake.  

Issues of **bias** can arise from an attitude or relationship that creates misgivings as to whether the decision maker will approach and determine the matters in issue in an objective way without concerns related to any self-interest. 

**Independence** arguments, by contrast, have appeared in Canada as a separate ground for challenging administrative decisions.  Section 11(h) of the *Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms* specifically refers to a requirement of an “independent and impartial tribunal” in the criminal context, but this has provided some guidance in administrative processes as well.  

**Independence**, or **lack of independence**, has become a basis for challenging administrative decisions and procedures where decision-makers’ independence is in issue.
