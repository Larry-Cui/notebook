# Defences

## Overview

A plaintiff may have successfully proved all elements of a negligence action, yet still be unsuccessful or only partially successful in their claim. The final topic in our study of Negligence law is that of **defences** to a negligence action. 

We will examine the **development** of defences available to a defendant as well as their **current application** in Canadian law.
