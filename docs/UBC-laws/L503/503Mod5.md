# Remoteness of Damage and Remedies

## Overview

In this module, we examine two Negligence concepts related to the single purpose of compensating the plaintiff: **Remoteness of Damage** and **Remedies** (i.e. awards/compensation for Damages). The rules relating to remedies and remoteness determine the **financial outcome of the claim**. 

**Aggravated and punitive damages** are sometimes awarded in **negligence** cases, whether involving personal injury or property loss—though they are especially rare in negligence claims, and are more common (though still exceptional) in claims for **intentional** torts. Regardless of the nature of the claim, the plaintiff needs to prove **certain elements** for each.

The **remoteness** issue concerns the limits to be imposed on the **extent of a defendant’s liability**. There has to be a **balance** between the defendant’s careless fault and the extent of damage that results. The issue at this stage of the negligence action is to determine whether the plaintiff’s injuries are considered “**too remote**” to be recoverable. Or, put another way, was the defendant’s negligent conduct the **proximate cause** of the plaintiff’s loss?

## Part 1 - Topic 1: Remoteness of Damages

The tests for **remoteness** are **legal tests**: they are a sort of safety valve for courts to address their concerns about **excessive tort liability** (recalling Lord Buckmaster’s words in ***Donoghue***, and the Supreme Court of Canada’s “**spectre of indeterminate liability**.”) As legal tests, they are **not for a jury to consider**, and an appeal court can overturn a trial judge’s decision on a question of remoteness.

The original test was **directness**. The new test applies **foreseeability**. 

The old directness test (**no longer the law in Canada**)

The case of ***Re Polemis & Furness Withy & Co.***, [1921] 3 K.B. 560 (C.A.) (at p 99, note 213) established “directness” as the test for remoteness. 

> In order to recover, a plaintiff had to show that the loss was a direct consequence of the defendant’s negligent act. If the plaintiff’s loss was a result of a logically connected sequence of events that flowed from the defendant’s negligent act (or omission), with no intervening causes, then the damages were not too remote. 

This test tended to favour plaintiffs, but not always. Sometimes foreseeable harm can occur in indirect ways, failing the “directness” test, as the court notes in ***Overseas Tankship (U.K.) Ltd. v. Morts Dock and Engineering Co. Ltd., The Wagon Mound (No. 1)***, [1961] A.C. 388 (P.C.). (at p 100, note 214 – “***Wagon Mound 1***”). In other situations, test could be difficult to apply, due to **difficulties in identifying the exact chain of events**. A large part of the problem was that the test itself was never clearly defined.

## Topic 2: The Reasonable Foreseeability Rule

**The foreseeability test**

A series of decisions of England’s top court, decided in 1961, 1963, and 1966, replaced it with a test of **foreseeability**.

The first case is ***Wagon Mound 1***, noted above. This Australian case is the one that formally overturned ***Polemis***. It was a 1961 decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (“JCPC”), at the time the top appeal court for Australia. **This decision changed the test from directness to foreseeability**. 

The question now was:

> whether the plaintiff’s loss was a **foreseeable consequence** of the defendant’s negligence.

In ***Wagon Mound 1***, ... the Court held that **foreseeability** is a better test, and on the facts found that it was not foreseeable that the oil would catch fire and severely damage the wharf. The defendants (although negligent) were not liable.

The ***Wagon Mound 1*** has, however, generally been interpreted as requiring that the damage be foreseeable as to a probability, drawing on this phrase:

> a [person] must be considered to be responsible for the **probable consequences** of [that person’s] act.

In other words, if it was reasonably foreseeable that the damage would probably result (reasonable probability), then the damage is not too remote and compensable. 

***Wagon Mound 1***’s version of the foreseeability test seems to favour defendants, it is harder for a plaintiff to establish that a loss is foreseeable as to a probability, than to prove it is a direct consequence of the negligence.

However, other cases suggest a lower threshold and as we shall see **Canadian cases since the 1960s may not require a plaintiff to prove that the consequences were probable**.
