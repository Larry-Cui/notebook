# Remoteness of Damage and Remedies

## Overview

In this module, we examine two Negligence concepts related to the single purpose of compensating the plaintiff: **Remoteness of Damage** and **Remedies** (i.e. awards/compensation for Damages). The rules relating to remedies and remoteness determine the **financial outcome of the claim**. 

**Aggravated and punitive damages** are sometimes awarded in **negligence** cases, whether involving personal injury or property loss—though they are especially rare in negligence claims, and are more common (though still exceptional) in claims for **intentional** torts. Regardless of the nature of the claim, the plaintiff needs to prove **certain elements** for each.

The **remoteness** issue concerns the limits to be imposed on the **extent of a defendant’s liability**. There has to be a **balance** between the defendant’s careless fault and the extent of damage that results. The issue at this stage of the negligence action is to determine whether the plaintiff’s injuries are considered “**too remote**” to be recoverable. Or, put another way, was the defendant’s negligent conduct the **proximate cause** of the plaintiff’s loss?

## **Part 1**

## Topic 1: Remoteness of Damages

The tests for **remoteness** are **legal tests**: they are a sort of safety valve for courts to address their concerns about **excessive tort liability** (recalling Lord Buckmaster’s words in ***Donoghue***, and the Supreme Court of Canada’s “**spectre of indeterminate liability**.”) As legal tests, they are **not for a jury to consider**, and an appeal court can overturn a trial judge’s decision on a question of remoteness.

The original test was **directness**. The new test applies **foreseeability**. 

The old directness test (**no longer the law in Canada**)

The case of ***Re Polemis & Furness Withy & Co.***, [1921] 3 K.B. 560 (C.A.) (at p 99, note 213) established “directness” as the test for remoteness. 

> In order to recover, a plaintiff had to show that the loss was a direct consequence of the defendant’s negligent act. If the plaintiff’s loss was a result of a logically connected sequence of events that flowed from the defendant’s negligent act (or omission), with no intervening causes, then the damages were not too remote. 

This test tended to favour plaintiffs, but not always. Sometimes foreseeable harm can occur in indirect ways, failing the “directness” test, as the court notes in ***Overseas Tankship (U.K.) Ltd. v. Morts Dock and Engineering Co. Ltd., The Wagon Mound (No. 1)***, [1961] A.C. 388 (P.C.). (at p 100, note 214 – “***Wagon Mound 1***”). In other situations, test could be difficult to apply, due to **difficulties in identifying the exact chain of events**. A large part of the problem was that the test itself was never clearly defined.

## Topic 2: The Reasonable Foreseeability Rule

**The foreseeability test**

A series of decisions of England’s top court, decided in 1961, 1963, and 1966, replaced it with a test of **foreseeability**.

The first case is ***Wagon Mound 1***, noted above. This Australian case is the one that formally overturned ***Polemis***. It was a 1961 decision of the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (“JCPC”), at the time the top appeal court for Australia. **This decision changed the test from directness to foreseeability**. 

The question now was:

> whether the plaintiff’s loss was a **foreseeable consequence** of the defendant’s negligence.

In ***Wagon Mound 1***, ... the Court held that **foreseeability** is a better test, and on the facts found that it was not foreseeable that the oil would catch fire and severely damage the wharf. The defendants (although negligent) were not liable.

The ***Wagon Mound 1*** has, however, generally been interpreted as requiring that the damage be foreseeable as to a probability, drawing on this phrase:

> a [person] must be considered to be responsible for the **probable consequences** of [that person’s] act.

In other words, if it was reasonably foreseeable that the damage would probably result (reasonable probability), then the damage is not too remote and compensable. 

***Wagon Mound 1***’s version of the foreseeability test seems to favour defendants, it is harder for a plaintiff to establish that a loss is foreseeable as to a probability, than to prove it is a direct consequence of the negligence.

However, other cases suggest a lower threshold and as we shall see **Canadian cases since the 1960s may not require a plaintiff to prove that the consequences were probable**.

**Modifications to the foreseeability test: “retreats” from its stricter rule**

The foreseeability test has been modified over the years. The modifications to the ***Wagon Mound 1*** test, sometimes called “retreats” from its apparent difficulty for plaintiffs, help the plaintiff establish liability. In other words they **expand liability**.

***<u>Retreat 1: Type of damage - Hugues</u>***

The first qualification to the test came only two years later, in ***Hughes v Lord Advocate [1963]***, A.C. 837 (H.L.) (at p 101, note 215). 

The House of Lords held that the **exact cause of an injury need not be foreseeable**, that is the exact sequence of events leading to it, as long as the type (or kind) of injury is foreseeable. It also held, importantly, that the **extent of the injury is not important either**, as long as it is a foreseeable kind.

Although the judges on the House of Lords are the same as those who sat on the JCPC, its decisions are formally binding only in the U.K. The ***Hughes*** case has, however, been adopted in Canada, see ***School Division of Assiniboine South, No. 3 v. Greater Winnipeg Gas Company Limited***, [1971 CanLII 959 (MB CA)](https://canlii.ca/t/gbqhj){:target=" \_blank"}, p 102 of text (note 219) , which was affirmed by the Supreme Court of Canada in 1973 when an appeal was dismissed. Considering this test you may find that it is ultimately quite subjective.

***<u>Retreat 2: Possibility of damage? – Wagon Mound 2</u>***

The same fire that was the basis of The ***Wagon Mound 1*** was also the basis of a second action. In ***Overseas Tankship (U.K.) Ltd . v. Miller Steamship Co. Pty. Ltd., The Wagon Mound (No. 2)***, [1967] 1 A.C. 617 (P.C.) [“***Wagon Mound 2***”], a 1966 decision of the JCPC (reported in 1967), Court found that the loss by fire was not too remote: i.e., in this case it was foreseeable. 

In this trial, there was evidence from the engineers who were doing the welding. They admitted that they foresaw some risk of furnace oil igniting, even when spread on open water. **It seemed unlikely to them, but possible.**

While some of the reasoning in this case is not all that clear, later cases interpreted it as changing the test from foreseeability as to a **probability** to foreseeability as to a **possibility**: i.e., a plaintiff need only show that it was reasonably foreseeable that the injury could possibly result. 

Canadian courts however do not set the threshold as low as a mere “possibility.” In ***Mustapha v. Culligan of Canada Ltd.***, [2008 SCC 27](https://canlii.ca/t/1wz6f){:target=" \_blank"}, at para 13, [see p 102, note 220] the Supreme Court of Canada reinterpreted ***Wagon Mound 2*** and confirmed that **the risk needs to be more than a mere possibility**: likely closer to a probability. However, that case, and most other Canadian cases, follow the ***Hughes*** case in focusing on the **kind of harm**, **rather than the specific series of events leading to the harm**.

## Topic 3: Special Remoteness Issues

**Thin skull** rule, as known as the “eggshell skull” rule, means that the tortfeasor takes the victim the tortfeasor gets, no matter how vulnerable. 

However, under the thin skull rule, for the defendant to be liable, there must be **proximate cause for the initial injury**. It is only the consequential injury that need not be proximate. 

The wrinkle that the longstanding thin skull rule adds to the ***Hughes*** rule is that, under thin skull, the **consequential injury does not** need to be the **same type** of injury as the initial injury, and the type of consequential injury need not be **foreseeable**.

The thin skull rule has been around for a long time. The question that came up after Wagon Mound 1 was whether that case had made the rule outdated. ***Smith v Leech Brain & Co.***, [1962] 2 Q.B. 405 (C.A.), a 1961 English decision (at p 105, note 226) answered this question: No. 

**A note on *Mustapha* and psychiatric harm**

The courts have, however, taken a seemingly opposite approach when it comes to “mere” psychiatric damage, or nervous shock, in the absence of physical damage. 

***Mustapha*** is a leading case on this type of injury. In ***Mustapha***, the Supreme Court confirmed the remoteness test of reasonable foreseeability enunciated in ***Wagon Mound 1*** and ***Hughes***, but added that in cases of mental injury the test must be considered in light of a person with “**ordinary fortitude**”. 

In addition, the Court stated that, to be compensable, the injury must amount to a “**recognizable psychiatric illness**”. 

***<u>Intervening Acts</u>***

“Intervening acts” (or intervening causes) refer to situations in which a defendant is negligent and subsequently a second cause intervenes resulting in a different loss, or aggravating the loss that the defendant’s negligence causes. 

The issue is whether the intervening act breaks the chain of causation stemming from the defendant’s negligence, thus relieving the defendant of liability for the loss (i.e., the loss would be too “remote”), or whether the chain of causation is not broken, leaving the defendant responsible for the consequences of the intervening act as well. The “**legally operative** intervening act” (see text p 106) is sometimes called a *novus actus* interveniens.

The **foreseeability test** is still used in some cases. However, the modern rule is usually the “**within the scope of the risk**” test, which can be **broader** than mere foreseeability:

> The second cause and the resultant damage must be within the scope of the risk of the first negligent act before the defendant will be liable.
In other words, **both the second cause and injury must fall within the chain of causation from the first injury**.

When, however, an intervening act is sufficient to “break the chain of causation” (i.e., it is not within the scope of the risk), that act is a *novus actus* interveniens: a new, intervening act. In these circumstances, the original tortfeasor will not be liable for the resulting loss. **It is only in rare cases that *novus actus* interveniens will be applied to completely exonerate the original tortfeasor.**

An example of a case in which an intervening negligent act did break the chain of causation was in ***Bradford et al. v. Kanellos et al.***, [1973 CanLII 1285 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/gwggw){:target=" \_blank"}, discussed in the text (at pp 107-108, note 228). 

***<u>Intervening medical error</u>***

There are special considerations when the tortfeasor is a physician. 

The text (at 108, note 231) refers to ***Price v. Milawski et al.***, [1977 CanLII 1400 (ON CA)](https://canlii.ca/t/g12l8){:target=" \_blank"}, where a second doctor’s negligence compounded the effects of the first doctor’s negligence. The Court applied the **foreseeability test** in this case, stating that where the subsequent negligence and consequent damage were reasonably foreseeable as a possible result of the original negligence, then the first doctor would be liable for all damage including from the time of the second doctor’s intervention forward. The second doctor was also liable from the point of his intervention forward. As such, both doctors were **jointly and severally liable** for this **subsequent damage**.

## Topic 4: Introduction to Remedies

Note that the words “damages” and “remedies” are sometimes used interchangeably although it’s more accurate to say that **a remedy is an “award of damages.”**

In this module we look at the **purpose of remedies**, and see the **different types of remedies** available to a plaintiff. We will focus on personal injury cases, and assume that all the other elements are proved, and the defendant is liable for the plaintiff’s losses. 

The text (at pp 124-140) in particular does a thorough job covering remedies for personal injury and fatal accidents (see also Note 272 for optional supplementary readings). 

**General Principles and Types of Remedies**

One way to classify damages (i.e. remedies, although in this context damages is term more commonly used) is according to the **function they serve**. According to this **classification**, tort damages can belong to one of several categories:

- **Nominal damages:** not available in negligence actions. Nominal damages are awarded for claims that are “**actionable without proof of loss**” (e.g., trespass, an intentional tort we cover in a subsequent Module). Although no substantial damage has been sustained, a nominal award may be made as **vindication** for the plaintiff’s rights being violated.
- **Compensatory damages:** almost **always** awarded in successful negligence actions. The purpose of compensatory damages is to place the plaintiff in the position the plaintiff would have been if the tort had not occurred. We will focus on this type of damage in this Module.
- **Punitive damages:** **rarely** awarded in negligence claims. Punitive damages are over and above compensatory damages. They punish the defendant for the wrongful behaviour. The plaintiff must show conduct on the part of the defendant that is malicious, outrageous, vicious, etc.
- A fourth category of damages is also available, called **aggravated damages**. This category of remedy is actually **a subset of compensatory damages**, but is only available in special cases.

## Topic 5: Personal Injury

In 1978 the Supreme Court of Canada swept that old approach aside with the “damages trilogy” (see p 124, note 273) three cases involving catastrophic injuries that it decided back to back: ***Andrews v. Grand & Toy Alberta Ltd.***, [1978 CanLII 1 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1mkb5){:target=" \_blank"}, ***Thornton v. School Dist. No. 57 (Prince George) et al.***, [1978 CanLII 12 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1mkbw){:target=" \_blank"}, and ***Arnold v. Teno***, [1978 CanLII 2 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1mkb7){:target=" \_blank"}. 
 
The Supreme Court of Canada established that the **proper approach to damages** in major-injury cases is to classify personal injury remedies under various **heads of damage**. 
 
**Types of compensatory damages: pecuniary & non-pecuniary; special and general**

The first step is to divide the claim between general and special damages:

- **General damages** are for harm that the plaintiff is suffering now and will continue to incur in the future, and which need to be **estimated**, since their extent and exact amount cannot be determined precisely.
- **Special damages** are for expenses that the plaintiff has already incurred before the date of the trial, due to the harm caused by the defendant’s negligence. These are known, objectively measured expenses. Think of them as “**specific**,” and “**exact**.”

The main difference between these two “heads of damage” is that special damages can be **precisely calculated**, e.g., out-of-pocket expenses, or provable amounts of income lost before trial. Special damages are generally straightforward, it is often just a matter of providing receipts for the expenses.

Courts then divide general damages into two further heads:

- **Pecuniary loss:** losses that are monetary in nature, such as the cost of care in the future, and lost earning capacity. These amounts can be calculated and are largely based on expert evidence. The bulk of ***Andrews*** is taken up by these.
- **Non-pecuniary loss:** damages that are more subjective, and do not relate to specific monetary losses, such as **pain and suffering**, loss of amenities of life, etc. These amounts must be “assessed,” i.e., a dollar figure assigned to them, **based on precedents** with similar injuries, and, since 1978, **subject to a cap**.

![damage categories](../pics/can_tort_law_m4_compens_types.png)

**Limitation Periods**

A ==**limitation period**== is the amount of time that a party has to bring an action against another, before their action will be statute-barred. 

The B.C. government recently rewrote its limitations statute, enacting the *Limitation Act*, [SBC 2012, c 13](https://canlii.ca/t/56462){:target=" \_blank"}, which came into force in 2013. It has replaced a range of time periods for different types of claims (tort, contract, property, etc.) with **one universal, 2-year limitation period**, subject to some exceptions (e.g., sexual assault: no limitation period). 

The general rule is in section 6: 

> a court proceeding in respect of a claim must not be commenced more than 2 years after the day on which the claim is **discovered**. 

Section 8 defines what amounts to “discovery” of the claim: the date on which the potential plaintiff **knew** or **reasonably ought to have known** that an “injury, loss or damage had occurred” and that the defendant caused it. 

Note that if the potential plaintiff is a **minor**, or is an adult **incapable** of managing the persons’ own affairs, the limitation period does not begin until the minor reaches the age of 19, or until the adult becomes capable of managing that person’s affairs (sections 18, 19).

**Burden of proof: onus and standard**

The plaintiff has the onus of proof on the question of **damages**. The plaintiff must show **actual loss**, whether **past**, **present** or **future**. To break these down:

- **Pre-trial losses:** These are losses that the plaintiff has sustained after the accident but prior to the trial. The plaintiff must prove these losses on a balance of probabilities, and if successful, will generally be awarded **100%** of the loss.
- **Future losses:** These are losses that the plaintiff will continue to incur after the trial, which include the **cost of future care and lost earning capacity**. There are two lines of thought as to the required standard of proof:
    - <u>on balance of probabilities:</u> if proven, there is **100%** compensation; if not proven, then nothing.
    - <u>reasonable or substantial possibility:</u> the plaintiff must prove whatever chance of occurrence of that future loss the plaintiff can, above what the court considers a “**reasonable minimum**.” A successful plaintiff will receive that percentage in compensation; if below a “reasonable minimum,” then nothing.

## **Part 2**

## Topic 6: Heads of Damage

The following diagram provides a summary of the various heads of compensatory damages in personal injury claims:

![heads of compensatory damages](../pics/can_tort_law_m5_compensat_damag.jpg)

**Pecuniary loss category (a): Future care costs**

Future care costs is the cost to provide appropriate care for the plaintiff given the plaintiff’s disabilities. Remember that the **primary objective of compensatory damages** is to place the victim in the position the victim would have been if the accident had not occurred. 

For ***Andrews***, items that fell under this head of damage included:

- cost of home care, including basic necessaries and personal assistance
- any special equipment he would require
- special medications

These costs are to be paid over a plaintiff’s **anticipated length of disability**.

The Supreme Court **deducted an amount of 20% for contingencies** that might affect the duration of the expense, such as having to spend some time in hospital.

**Pecuniary loss category (b): Lost earning capacity**

If a plaintiff cannot return to work due to the disability, the courts can award an amount for lost earning capacity. This lost potential can be based on **past earnings** (e.g. where a plaintiff is partially disabled and able to return to the same job in the future). The award can also be based on the “**capital asset**” approach (more common where a plaintiff is permanently disabled and not able to return to the same or possibly any job). 

Of course, where possible the **plaintiff must mitigate loss** by looking for other types of work.

In Andrews, the Supreme Court took the **average wage** for someone in the plaintiff’s position (halfway between the starting wage and the maximum) and used that as the basis for the calculation of his projected level of earnings. **Expert evidence** is usually required to make this calculation. Factors affecting the amount of future lost income include the plaintiff’s **projected length of working life** (projected retirement), and **contingencies** (deduction for possible unemployment, illness, accident, and business depression).

**Adjustment Factors for Pecuniary Awards**

**Contingencies** are an adjustment factor that courts use to determine the appropriate amount of **awards for future care and future lost income**. 

There are **two other adjustments** that courts make, which are more general, and are not specific to the facts of each case. These are the “**discount rate**” and “**tax gross-up**” (discussed in text at pp 127 and 128, and referred to in ***Andrews*** as “allowance for tax”). 

<u>Discount rate, a.k.a. Capitalization</u>

When awarding a lump sum, ...the court has to predict this rate of return. At the same time, courts must take inflation into account, because of the reduced purchasing power of this money in the future. The discount rate will ensure that there will be enough money to cover the payments in the future, while also ensuring that the plaintiff will not be overcompensated.

In B.C., legislation has set the discount rate, so courts don’t need to calculate it. The *Law and Equity Regulation*, [BC Reg 352/81](https://canlii.ca/t/5286g){:target=" \_blank"}, s 1: sets these rates:

- 3.5%, for costs of future care
- 2.5%, for lost earning capacity

Courts must deduct these percentages from the awards under these heads of damage. The lower amount for lost earning capacity reflects the fact that over time most people expect to receive salary increases which out-pace inflation.

<u>Tax Gross-up</u>

A second consideration when determining the amount of the lump sum is the tax impact. Tax is not paid on the lump sum award itself (because lump sum award usually is compensation for specific losses), but it is paid on interest and other forms of return on investment of that lump sum award. 

For future care awards, the court takes the tax effect into account. It will apply a tax gross up on the future care portion of lump sum awards, but not on structured judgements. 

**A structured judgement** is a **court-ordered periodic payment** of the award over time, as opposed to a single lump-sum payment at the time of judgement. Tax is not paid on the periodic payments (see page 125).

For awards for loss of future earning capacity, generally the courts do not add gross up. This is because the award is supposed to equal the plaintiff’s lost “gross” income, on which the plaintiff would have had to pay tax anyway.

However, in motor vehicle cases in B.C., s 98 of the *Insurance (Vehicle) Act*, [RSBC 1996, c 231](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96231_01){:target=" \_blank"} now requires pre-trial loss of income claims to be based on net income (i.e., income after taxes). This makes sense for periodic judgements, but it also applies where the court decides or is required to award a lump sum. Section 99(3) of the *Act* permits the court to include an amount for tax gross-up on the lost income award.

> **Note:** when structured judgements are awarded, the discount rate and grossing-up practice are not relevant. They are only for lump-sum payments.

**Non-pecuniary loss**

What should a plaintiff receive for pain and suffering, for the loss of quality of life? The Supreme Court of Canada has said that damages in this category are **for solace**: in other words, to provide the plaintiff with “physical arrangements which can make ... life more endurable”. 

In ***Andrews***, the Supreme Court held that $100,000 is the maximum allowable under this head of damage. That amount, however, is in 1978 dollars. The inflation-adjusted amount is approximately $350,000 dollars today.

> To convert non-pecuniary amounts into today's dollar, you can use the Bank of Canada [inflation calculator](https://www.bankofcanada.ca/rates/related/inflation-calculator/){:target=" \_blank"}.

The maximum **limit** to non-pecuniary damages only applies to those damages that stem from **physical injury**. 

<u>Non-pecuniary loss for non-catastrophic injuries</u>

For non-catastrophic injuries, the amount is determined on a *de facto* tariff based on **precedent cases**. In other words, the non-pecuniary remedy will depend on what was awarded in other cases where similar injuries were sustained.

## Topic 7: Factors Affecting Remedies and Assessment

**Mitigation**

Even though the plaintiff may have suffered loss, there is still an **obligation on the plaintiff** to keep these losses to a reasonable minimum. 

Mitigation is a defence to a negligence claim, so the **defendant has the burden of proving** that the **plaintiff failed to mitigate**. 

<u>Role of judges (and juries)</u>

The assessment of damages is **a question of fact** to be decided by the trier of fact, assuming that the judge has applied the correct legal principles to the heads of damage. 

The recourse to a jury trial remains a right in civil law but due to the unpredictability of a jury, civil jury trials are becoming rarer in Canada.  The only possible exception is in motor vehicle accident cases where they are sometimes seen more frequently. 

The rules for jury trials are set out in the *Supreme Court Civil Rules*, [BC Reg 168/2009](https://canlii.ca/t/56m69){:target=" \_blank"}, and the *Jury Act*, [RSA 2000, c J-3](https://canlii.ca/t/565t4){:target=" \_blank"}.

<u>Lump-sum payments vs. structured settlements</u>

As a general rule, judges only have the power to award lump sums. Plaintiffs usually prefer lump-sum payments. 

Since 1998 in B.C., however, judges are required, subject to a few exceptions, to impose **structured judgements** in **motor vehicle accident cases involving pecuniary loss** (both future care and lost income awards) greater than **$100,000** if it is in the plaintiff’s best interests. This is set out in section 99 of the *Insurance (Vehicle) Act*, [RSBC 1996, c 231](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/96231_01){:target=" \_blank"}. 

A structured judgement allows for periodic payments, as opposed to a lump sum, which can be **adjusted as circumstances change**. Do not confuse **structured judgements** with **structured settlements**, which are negotiated out of court and have been around for many years.

**Collateral Benefits**

An issue can arise when a plaintiff is injured and receives some financial help from other collateral sources as a result of the injury (e.g., private insurance, disability benefits, welfare or unemployment benefits, pension benefits, etc.). The plaintiff then sues the defendant. 

> *What is the effect of these collateral benefits on the defendant’s liability?*

In general, a defendant is **not entitled to have the judgement reduced** in the case of private insurance benefits, charitable and other gifts, pension benefits, welfare, or E.I. benefits. Other benefits that are in the nature of insurance benefits, in the sense that the plaintiff has paid for them in some way, are included in this list. 

Each specific situation is subject, of course, to statutory rules to the **contrary**. For instance, Part 7 benefits received prior to trial under the *Insurance (Vehicle) Regulation*, [BC Reg 447/83](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/447_83_00){:target=" \_blank"}, for injuries arising out of a motor vehicle accident, are required by the *Act* to be deducted from the defendant’s judgement.

In ***Cunningham v. Wheeler; Cooper v. Miller; Shanks v. McNee***, [1994 CanLII 120 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1frv3){:target=" \_blank"} (see text p 132, note 288) the plaintiff sued the defendant for injuries suffered when he was hit by the defendant’s car. The Supreme Court of Canada had to consider whether disability benefits received by the plaintiff from his employer when he was off work had to be deducted from the claim, which included an amount for lost wages. The question was whether these benefits were in the nature of insurance benefits. 

In these cases, on one hand there is a concern about **over-compensation** (since the plaintiff is being paid twice if no deduction is made). On the other hand, there is the view that the **defendant should not benefit** from extra payments in the form of insurance that the plaintiff has, after all, been paying premiums for. 

The Supreme Court has given more weight to the latter concern in recognizing the right of the plaintiff to keep these types of benefits. 

The problem in Cunningham was that the plaintiff employee had not “directly” paid for the benefits. There were no premium deductions from his pay cheque, for instance. However, the court held that **direct payments were not the only way to prove contribution**. Indirect payment through trade-offs in the collective bargaining process was sufficient. The plaintiff was able to establish such an indirect contribution, and the Supreme Court refused to make a deduction from the damages the defendant had to pay.

<u>Doctrine of subrogation</u>

The **doctrine of subrogation** states that where an employer or insurance company is legally obligated to make an indemnity payment to the victim of some injury (i.e, a payment of compensation to a customer or employee), they have the right to “**step into the shoes**” of the victim and pursue the claim against the tortfeasor on the victim’s behalf, or require repayment if the victim/plaintiff pursues the claim and recovers (see p 124). 

The right to repayment only **extends to the actual amount** of the payment, and not any extra received by the plaintiff. The doctrine of subrogation is **an equitable rule**, but it can also be based, in certain specific cases, on legislation (e.g., dealing with workers’ compensation or provincial health insurance) or contract.

In some cases, even where there is a right of subrogation, it **might not be exercised**. It is either a goodwill gesture, or just too much work to bother with.

<u>Calculating damages</u>

The text at p 133-134 gives the example of ***Danicek v. Alexander Holburn Beaudin & Lang***, [2010 BCSC 1111](https://canlii.ca/t/2c0pn){:target=" \_blank"}, as an example of personal injuries damages assessment. The case is summarized in the text and it is not part of our required reading for this Module. 

## Topic 8: Punitive and Aggravated Damages

Aggravated and punitive damages are sometimes awarded in negligence cases, whether involving personal injury or property loss, though they are especially **rare in negligence** claims, and are more **common** (though still exceptional) in claims **for intentional torts**. 

**Punitive damages**

Punitive damages ... are damages to punish the tortfeasor for conduct that is “malicious, high-handed or oppressive,” which shocks the court’s sense of decency, and **no actual proof of loss is required**. Punitive damages, also known as exemplary damages, can be awarded in negligence cases where the defendant has been **grossly negligent**, or in cases where there is an **independent actionable wrong** (such as breach of trust or breach of fiduciary duty). 

The principles applicable to awarding punitive damages are **outlined** in ***Whiten v. Pilot Insurance Co.***, [2002 SCC 18](https://canlii.ca/t/51vn){:target=" \_blank"}.

**Aggravated damages**

Aggravated damages, on the other hand, are damages that are awarded to the plaintiff because the defendant’s conduct was a shock to the plaintiff and caused injury to feelings, dignity, mental anguish, stress or humiliation. The purpose of these damages is to **compensate** the plaintiff, and not to punish the wrongdoer. 

Unlike punitive damages, the **plaintiff must prove actual injury** before a court will award aggravated damages. In negligence cases, aggravated damages may be awarded on top of non-pecuniary damages, and it also appears that it can be beyond the upper limit set in ***Andrews***. They are only awarded in exceptional cases.

Typically both aggravated and punitive damage awards in Canada have been in the somewhat **low to moderate range** ($10,000 to $75,000). However, in the last few decades Canadian courts began to make large awards. A prime example of this is ***Hill v. Church of Scientology of Toronto***, [1995 CanLII 59 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1frgn){:target=" \_blank"}, a leading **defamation** case, which we will cover in a later Module under Defamation.

The question of whether punitive damages awards were getting too high came to a head in the contract law case of ***Whiten***, mentioned above. The Supreme Court laying out the **key principles for punitive awards in all civil claims**. Punitive damages are only be awarded in exceptional cases to provide for the aim of **punishment**, **deterrence** and **denunciation**.
