## Topic 1: Application of the "But for" Test and Cause-in-Fact

Before we begin, the text (at 54) refers to the need to avoid confusion between “cause-in-fact” and “proximate cause.” “Proximate cause”, or remoteness of damage, is a legal question left to the judge to determine and we will discuss it further in a subsequent module. Some lawyers combine “**causation**” and “**proximate cause**” into one element. However, the questions of cause-in-fact and proximate cause raise distinct issues, so it’s appropriate that we cover them separately.

**The Basic “But For” Test: Some Explanations And Comments**

The basic test for the **causation** element is “**but for**”: 

> But for the defendant’s negligent act, the plaintiff would not have suffered this harm. 

It is also known as “*sine qua non*”, i.e., “without which, nothing”. Here are some ways of putting it:

- Accident would not have happened without the defendant’s negligent act
    - Negligent act need not have been **sufficient** to cause harm on its own, but must be **necessary** for the harm to have occurred
- In other words: If the accident would have occurred just the same, whether or not the defendant acted, then the defendant is not a cause of the loss
    - Put another way: the defendant’s act must have **made a difference**

In most cases, there is no way to do a controlled experiment to determine causation with **certainty**. (This may be possible in rare cases, e.g., ones involving chemical reactions that can be replicated in a lab.) So courts make a **guess**, on the **balance of probabilities**, based on available evidence.

!!! info "General Comments"

    What is and is not enough to satisfy the test?

    - It is **not enough**:
        - that the defendant’s conduct “possibly” caused harm.
        - that the defendant’s conduct deprived the plaintiff of a chance to avoid injury. This is called “**loss of chance**” and the Supreme Court rejected it in the 1991 case ***Laferrière v. Lawson***, [1991 CanLII 87 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fslw){:target=" \_blank"} (see text at 66)
    - It is **enough**:
        - that the defendant’s conduct “probably” caused the harm. 
            - (where multiple forces contribute to an accident) if a person's negligence **substantially contributed** to an accident, it is also a cause of the accident. [Note that this is possible a cause of an accident by acting along with others, or by failing to prevent it. It is distinct from the “material contribution to risk test” which we will discuss below]
        - What about other causes of the harm?
            - **If the defendant can prove the injury would have happened anyway, regardless of the defendant’s negligent act, then causation is disproved.**

!!! danger "Module 4 - Topic 1: Practice Question"

    1. Select the option from the drop-down list that does not satisfy the "**but-for**" test:
        - [ ] defendant's action likely caused the plaintiff's harms
        - [x] defendant's action possibly caused the plaintiff's harms
        - [ ] defendant's action, beyond a reasonable doubt, caused the plaintiff's harms
        - [ ] without the defendant's action, the plaintiff would not have suffered his/her harms
    > In the "but for" test the court analyzes the evidence based on a **balance of probabilities**. In other words "but for" the defendant's actions, there is at least a **greater than 50% chance** that the plaintiff's harms would not have occurred. All the selections satisfy this requirement except for the defendant's action "possibly" causing the plaintiff's harms.

## Topic 2: Case Law Illustrating the "But For" Test

***Athey*** illustrates the effect of a plaintiff proving that two or more tortfeasors caused the harm. The defendants are “**jointly and severally liable**.” This means that each of them is **fully responsible** for the harm to the plaintiff. 

In this case, the liability was split 50/50 among the defendants, but that only matters to the defendants themselves. To the plaintiff it does not matter, since if only one defendant has any money at the time of judgement, that defendant will have to fully compensate the plaintiff. The defendant would then pursue the other defendant for half of the damages award. That is what “jointly and severally” means: **defendants jointly liable for the full amount, but, among themselves, able to divide up the damage award**.

    - A defendant is liable for any injuries caused or contributed to by his or her negligence.  The presence of other non‑tortious contributing causes does not reduce the extent of that liability.  **Loss cannot be apportioned according to the degree of causation where it is created by tortious and non‑tortious causes**.
    - Causation is established where the plaintiff proves to the civil standard that the defendant caused or contributed to the injury.  **The general, but not conclusive, test for causation is the “but for” test**, which requires the plaintiff to show that the injury would not have occurred but for the negligence of the defendant.   **Where the “but for” test is unworkable, the courts have recognized that causation is established where the defendant’s negligence “materially contributed” to the occurrence of the injury.**   
    - In some circumstances an inference of causation may be drawn from the evidence without positive scientific proof.  The plaintiff need not establish that the defendant’s negligence was the sole cause of the injury.  **The law does not excuse a defendant from liability merely because other causal factors for which he or she is not responsible also helped produce the harm.**  It is sufficient if the defendant’s negligence was a cause of the harm.
    - **Apportionment between tortious and non‑tortious causes is contrary to the principles of tort law** because the defendant would escape full liability even though he or she caused or contributed to the plaintiff's entire injuries.  The plaintiff would not be adequately compensated, since he or she would not be placed in the original position he or she would be in  absent the defendant's negligence.
    - **Separation of distinct and divisible injuries** is not truly apportionment; it is simply making each defendant liable only for the injury he or she  has caused, according to the usual rule.  Separation is also **permitted** where some of the injuries have tortious causes and some have non‑tortious causes.  Again, **such cases merely recognize that the defendant is not liable for injuries which were not caused by his or her negligence.**
    - The plaintiff’s loss is the difference between the original position the plaintiff would have been in absent the defendant’s negligence and the plaintiff’s position after the tort.  Where a**n intervening event** unrelated to the tort affects the plaintiff’s “original position”, the net loss is not as great as it might have otherwise seemed, so **damages would be reduced to reflect this**.
    - The defendant need not put the plaintiff in a position better than his or her original position.  The defendant is liable for the additional damage but not the pre‑existing damage.
    - The **25 percent** contribution of the two accidents to the disc herniation assessed by the trial judge fell outside the *de minimis* range and therefore constituted a **material contribution** sufficient to render the defendant fully liable for the damages flowing from the disc herniation.   Notwithstanding the plaintiff’s back problems before the accident, it was reasonable to infer a causal connection (which was supported by the evidence) between the disc herniation and the two accidents.

    - While proof of causation in medical malpractice cases is often difficult for the patient, it is unnecessary to adopt either of the alternatives arising out of the ***McGhee v. National Coal Board*** case, **namely**, that the plaintiff simply prove that the defendant created a risk that the injury which occurred would occur, or that the defendant has the burden of disproving causation, since, **properly applied, the traditional principles relating to causation are adequate to the task**.  Adoption of either of the proposed alternatives would have the effect of compensating plaintiffs where a substantial connection between the injury and the defendant's conduct is absent.  A plaintiff should not be compensated by reversing the burden of proof for an injury that may very well be due to factors unconnected to the defendant and not the fault of anyone.
    - Causation need not be determined with scientific precision.  In many malpractice cases, the facts lie particularly within the knowledge of the defendant, and very little affirmative evidence on the part of the plaintiff will **justify the drawing of an inference of causation in the absence of evidence to the contrary**.  It is not strictly accurate to speak of the burden of proof shifting to the defendant when what is meant is that **evidence adduced by the plaintiff may result in an inference being drawn adverse to the defendant**.  The legal or ultimate burden remains with the plaintiff, but in the absence of evidence to the contrary adduced by the defendant an inference of causation may be drawn although positive or scientific proof of causation has not been adduced.  
    - If some evidence to the contrary is adduced by the defendant, the trial judge should weigh that evidence according to the proof.  It is therefore not essential that the medical experts provide a firm opinion supporting the plaintiff's theory of causation.  **Medical experts ordinarily determine causation in terms of certainties whereas a lesser standard is demanded by the law.**  It is the function of the trier of fact, not the medical witnesses, to make a legal determination of the question of causation.

**How the Courts Deal with Uncertainty**

In our readings this week, ***Athey***, and ***Snell*** are all cases in which the “but for” test was applied. In cases that turn on the question of causation, there is negligence: the issue is whether that negligent act caused the harm.

***Snell*** is another case in which the court applied “but for” test. The defendant had argued that the plaintiff failed to prove causation. The plaintiff argued that it was impossible to prove causation, since he had been on the operating table at the time of the harm, and only the hospital staff who did the work could say what happened. But **Sopinka J.** whose area of specialty was the law of evidence, wrote a miniature textbook on inferring negligence, saying that **it won’t always take much to prove “but for” causation**.

***Athey*** is another miniature textbook. There, the Supreme Court goes through a series of arguments that the defendants made about causation. You should carefully read the arguments at **paras 21-36**, under the heading “Inapplicability of Respondents’ [Defendants’] Analogies”, since they explain many fine points about causation, as well as **proximate cause** and **thin vs. crumbling skull**. We will return to those latter points in a subsequent Module.

As the court says in ***Snell***, scientific certainty is not required. It is impossible to determine causation with 100% certainty in these types of cases.
