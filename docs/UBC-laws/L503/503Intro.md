## Syllabus

***Mid-term Case Comment Assignment***

Students will be asked to choose one of several listed torts cases and write a case comment on it. Students may also select their own torts case to comment on (so long as it is pre-approved by me beforehand).  The Assignment will be available on Monday, February 16 and will be due on ==**Friday, February 27 at 5pm (PST)**==. 

Late assignments will be penalized according to Allard Law School policies.  For each or any part of a day that the assignment is late, including weekends and statutory holidays and other days when the law school is closed, the student will lose 5% of the maximum possible value of the assignment for the first day or part of a day that the assignment is late and an additional 2% for each subsequent day or part of a day.

The assignment will have a maximum word count, as well as certain formatting requirements.    

Please see the assignment instructions on the course website after February 16 to ensure you understand the requirements and instructions.

***Final Exam***

==**UBC will set the scheduling of the final exam.**==  You will have three hours to write the exam.  It will be ==**open book**== and consist of a long answer fact pattern and short answer discussion questions.  You will be expected to cite appropriate case law and/or statutes.

All exams in Allard's online courses are written on your own computer through a software called Proctorio. 

***Readings***

The required text, Philip H Osborne, *The Law of Torts*, 6th ed. (Toronto: Irwin Law, 2020) is available through the UBC bookstore.

This course will be conducted through a combination of short video introductions, readings, online discussions, practice quizzes

I will work through this course with you to monitor discussions, answer questions and evaluate your work in the course. 

The course is divided into 11 Module Topics that are designed to be covered in the 13 weeks of the term.  To address each Topic, you will be asked to undertake a number of tasks, including reading, writing, taking practice quizzes and discussing the materials.  You will also see that most Topics are accompanied by an Activity or Assignment.  Use these Activities or Assignment to provide some focus to your readings, and to contextualize them in relation to the course as a whole.
