## Topic 1: What is a "Tort"?

A tort has come to mean a type of **civil wrong**.

In the practical sense for lawyers a “tort” is a **private case** where someone sues someone else. It generally starts when an individual, group of individuals or a corporation have a legal dispute. This is different from public law, which involves the state (government) and issues relevant to the whole of society (criminal law, tax law, constitutional law, etc.).

For our purposes in this course we are looking at private cases involving torts and negligent action, intention to harm or some strict liability that results in some demand for a remedy or compensation.

The largest area of tort law is the **law of negligence**, which we focus on in the first part of this course. Other areas of tort law that involve **intentional torts** and **strict liability** are covered in later modules.

## Topic 2: Tort Law vs Other Areas of Canadian Law

Sketch of Canadian law’s categories:

![sketch of Canadian law’s categories](../pics/can_tort_law_m1_categories.jpg)

Tort law is distinguishable from the following:

- Criminal law: an area of public law. There is some overlap between criminal law and tort law, in the sense that the same set of facts may give rise to both a criminal charge and tort law dispute. Consider the infamous ***O.J. Simpson*** case, which generated both a criminal charge of murder (public) and a tort dispute for wrongful death (civil). But in the criminal case, the state would prosecute the offender on behalf of society. The purpose of any sentence would be to punish the offender, and any fine ordered would be payable to the state. In the civil case, the state is not involved (except passively, through the judge). The wronged person sues the offender on the person’s own behalf, and receives monetary compensation if successful.

- Administrative law: Public law. There is likewise overlap between tort law and the rules government sets for how individuals and businesses act (e.g., environmental regulations) and tort law. **Indeed, legislation that creates obligations or sets standards for doing certain activities is often used in tort litigation**, as we will see later this term. But they are separate areas of law, with distinct consequences. And, as with all areas of public law, it is the state that enforces regulatory law, whereas it is private persons who enforce tort law by taking claims to court.

- Contract law: Private law. Contract law deals with the rules surrounding "agreements" made between parties. Torts can arise in the context of contractual settings (in fact, the two areas often overlap), but the rules are distinct. 

- Property law: Private law. Property law is concerned with the ownership and use of property and is distinct from tort, although as mentioned in the text, the tort of trespass to land is one area where the two areas of the law intersect.

- Law of equity: Private law. The laws of equity are those rules developed by the old English Court of Chancery (also referred to as the Court of Equity). This court and the rules it developed were a response to what were considered inadequacies in the common law. They were a way for the court to provide remedies that would otherwise not be allowed under the common law. The rules of equity concerned for the most part property law and contract law. They had very little impact on tort law.

!!! info "Brief History of Tort Law"

    Under the English common law, parties were not able to bring suit against another party without permission of the King or Queen, through the issuance of a legal document known as a writ. The readings mention the two different writs that were important to the development of tort law: the **trespass writ** (“***trespass vi et armis***”), and the **case writ** (“***trespass on the case***”). The trespass writ related to direct injuries to person or property (for example, where one person hits another). The case writ dealt with injuries that were caused indirectly.

    Legislation abolished the writ system in the 1870s, but the rules developed under that system have influenced the new torts that replaced the writs, as we will see at various points in the term. One important difference between the writ system and the current catalogue of torts is that **torts today are based, for the most part, on various notions of fault, and not on how the injury was caused**.

    The intentional torts (battery, assault, false imprisonment, etc.), which we cover later in this course, originated in the trespass writ. Negligence law, which we cover first, emerged from the case writ.

## Topic 3: Canadian Tort Law Categories

We can divide modern tort law into four categories of action: 

- negligence, 
- the intentional torts, 
- strict liability, and 
- a residual group of actions based on unique principles of liability.

![tort categories](../pics/can_tort_law_m1_liability.jpg)

There is also an additional type of liability: absolute liability. Absolute liability is liability without fault, where people are held liable simply because they committed the act. It has nothing to do with one’s intentions or fault. **Today, there are no absolute liability torts.**

## Topic 4: Tort Law's Objectives

In summary, some of the functions of tort law include:

- **Justice:** Corrective justice, requiring victims to be **compensated for unjustified losses**, is most often said to underpin tort law. It involves “moral wrongdoing for which the offender must pay.” But there are contrary views to this classic statement, from a case we will soon read (***Donoghue v Stevenson***, quoted in chapter 1 near the top of page 14).

- **Compensation:** This is perhaps the other leading view, and one that does not focus on “justice”: One of the main goals of tort law is to compensate victims for their losses, based someone else caused those losses. **It does not require wrongdoing on the part of the defendant, but rather ensures that the victim is compensated for losses suffered.**

- **Appeasement:** This function of tort law is related to the idea of **psychological satisfaction**, in that the victim can be comforted and achieve mental healing through public vindication of the victim’s rights.

- **Deterrence:** Deterrence here includes both specific (the tortfeasor/wrongdoer) and general (society at large) deterrence. However, there is a debate in the legal world on how much of a deterrent effect the tort system actually provides. In some areas tort law has been more effective as a deterrent, while weaker in others. (see Trebilcock, “*The Efficacy of the Tort System and Its Alternatives: A Review of Empirical Evidence*).

- **Punishment:** In limited cases the court can award **punitive damages** against the tortfeasor (the person who committed the tort, who would be the defendant in a tort lawsuit), over and above any compensation for injuries.

- **Loss allocation:** Various economic theories for allocating losses in tort cases are described briefly in the text. **None of these theories have been adopted in Canada.** Note in particular the "market deterrence" theory, which has been adopted in the U.S. in the context of manufacturers’ liability. Manufacturers are held strictly liable for injuries caused by their defective products. This has the effect of raising prices, which has the effect of reducing demand and consumption. Fewer injuries are caused. Through the allocation of accident costs, tort law has achieved a safer market place (i.e., fewer accidents).

- **Ombudsman:** Under this analysis, tort law may be used to highlight and “cure” systemic abuses of government, corporate agencies and other entities through the publicity of a lawsuit.

- **Empowerment of the injured:** This is a more recent, idealized view of tort law raised by Linden, which goes even beyond his “ombudsman” argument. It encompasses compensation, compliance, education, and psychological satisfaction to provide empowerment to the injured party.

!!! danger "Topic 4: Practice Question"

    Which objective of tort law fits best with the concept of **punitive damages**?

    - [ ] justice 
    - [x] punishment 
    - [ ] compensation 
    - [ ] No answer text provided. 
    > In limited cases the court can award punitive damages against the tortfeasor (the person who committed the tort, who would be the defendant in a tort lawsuit), over and above any compensation for injuries. Punitive damages are meant to punish a tortfeasor for any conduct that is particularly heinous or malicious in nature. It may serve a function in deterring similar future actions by other similarly placed individuals.
