# Standard of Care and Special Standards

## Overview

In the previous module you were introduced to the elements of negligence and the specific element of the duty of care. In this module we will examine the next negligence element, **the standard of care**. We will cover the **ordinary** and **special** standard of care owed to others and the **burden proof** in negligence claims.

## Topic 1: The Standard of Care and The Reasonable Person

<p class="highlight blue" markdown="1">*The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man.* <br><br>
- **George Bernard Shaw**</p>

The next negligence element we will discuss is the standard of care. This is usually the most **commonly litigated issue** of all the elements in a negligence lawsuit, i.e., the aspect of a negligence claim that is most often in dispute, and therefore takes up the most time in court. In many cases (for example, in motor vehicle accident cases), it is clear that the defendant owes a duty of care to the plaintiff. 

The question really in issue in most negligence cases is **whether the defendant breached the standard of care on the facts in that case**. As noted above, there are two questions to be answered under standard of care:

- What is the **test for the standard of care**? This is **a question of law** for judges (not juries) to determine, and an appeal court can reverse the lower court’s decision if the appeal court disagrees with the lower court’s definition of the test.
- **Was that standard breached**? In other words, was the defendant negligent (“negligent” here is used in the narrow sense we saw earlier). This is **a question of fact** for the trier-of-fact: either the jury, or, if there is no jury, the judge. Appeal courts generally won’t overturn trial court decisions on questions of fact, unless there was some error of law in the way the trial court applied the rule to the facts. In some rare cases of “**palpable and overriding error**” on the facts, the appeal court may also reverse a trial court’s factual finding. 

There will be further discussion of what constitutes a “palpable and overriding error” in a case we will read later in the course, ***Galaske v. O'Donnell***, [1994 CanLII 128 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1frvm){:target=" \_blank"}.

In this Module we discuss the **general rule**, which applies to most people most of the time: 

> the reasonable person of ordinary intelligence, acting prudently and taking reasonable steps to avoid putting others at risk. 

I will focus on the general rule, known as the “reasonable person” standard, and on reasonable vs. unreasonable risk (which is critical in courts’ analysis of whether the standard was breached). The other cases in this week’s readings are on situations in which an external source helps to define the standard: **custom or statute**.

### 1. General Rule for Standard of Care: Reasonable Person Test

The test used to measure the standard of care in most cases is, in short, the “reasonable person” test. When the law measures a person’s behaviour by this standard, it is applying an objective test or standard. By contrast, when the law is concerned only with a specific person’s actual behaviour or thoughts, the courts are applying a subjective test. Our first case illustrates the difference.

As Osborne notes in our text, ***Vaughan v Menlove*** (1837, UK) authoritatively established the standard of care for a reasonable person. In ***Vaughan***, the court stated that a breach of standard of care would depend on whether the defendant “**proceeded with such reasonable caution as a prudent man would have exercised under such circumstances**.” It did not matter that the defendant may have been of below-average intelligence, or that he acted honestly and *bona fide* (in good faith) to the best of his own judgement.

**Tindal CJ** rejects the subjective test as being, well, too subjective. The court did not ask, “did this man do his best to take care, given what he knows?” Instead, it asked: what would the reasonable person have done in the situation? In the eyes of the law, doing your best ain’t enough.

However, the law usually requires **experts** to meet a **higher standard**, when doing the thing at which they have expertise. There are also exceptions for certain public service workers (i.e. volunteer firefighters) who may be held to a lower standard due to the nature of their activities

The central element in applying standard of care is **foreseeability** of the risk of injury to others. The text references several cases involving children injured when into contact with high voltage electrical wires, including ***Gloster*** and ***Amos***.

***Gloster*** in particular implies that a defendant who chooses to be wilfully blind, that is, to not to seek out information that would help the person to be more careful, would not avoid liability. In ***Amos***, the defendants unsuccessfully tried to argue that the risk was not foreseeable. The defendants relied on ***Moule v New Brunswick (Electric Power Commission)*** (1960), 24 D.L.R. (2d) 305 (S.C.C.). However, the key difference is that in ***Moule*** the defendant had taken some action to try to remove the reasonable risk of danger.

In summary, the application of the standard depends on all the circumstances of a particular case. **It is about what the reasonable person would do if that person had been in the position of the defendant, with the information available to the defendant.** The reasonable, prudent person would seek out such information, taking reasonable steps to obtain it. Failing to do so amounts to negligence.

    The defendant company transmitting such a dangerous element as electricity through their wires thus strung along a public highway fall short of being insurers, but **are bound to exercise the greatest possible care** and to use every possible precaution for the protection of the public.

    Their wires in the condition in which they were at the time and place where the boy was so badly injured constituted a danger to those using the highway and were in fact a ***nuisance***. 
    
    They had become worn and defective and had ceased to be insulated and to offer any protection in case they came into contact with any one. These uninsulated wires were within a few inches, between 14 and 20, of the railing of the bridge, and **it ought to have been present to the minds of the defendant company** that if not grown up people at any rate children crossing the bridge or playing upon it would be exceedingly likely to touch the wires. 
    
    To my mind the maintenance of these dangerous uninsulated wires charged with deadly electricity within a few inches of the bridge over which a large number of people daily passed for some months after its re-construction had been completed, and coupled with the other facts proved, fully **justified** the findings of the jury.

!!! info "*Amos v. New Brunswick Electric Power Commission*, [1976 CanLII 160 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1z6fm){:target=" \_blank"}, headnote"

    The respondent and others who erect electric lines carrying heavy charges have a duty to take proper precautions against injury resulting therefrom. 
    
    As the trial judge noted the poplar is a fast growing tree. That fast growing tree stood directly beneath lines running along the top of poles and carrying up to 7,200 volts. The only evidence as to an attempt to keep the tree from these lines was that it was stated to be the practice of the power company to trim such trees every four to seven years and that so far as the company’s inspector knew that practice had been kept up in reference to the particular tree. 
    
    The wires were at least 30 ft. above the ground and any contact with them could have been avoided by the simple expedient of cutting off the top of the tree. It was left uncut and its mid-summer foliage concealed the presence of the wires from a boy carrying out the perfectly normal play activity of climbing a tree. **The accident could have been foreseen** and was almost inevitable given active boys and that the tree was directly in front of their home.

!!! info "*Priestman v. Colangelo, Shynall and Smythson*, [1959 CanLII 14 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1tvpf){:target=" \_blank"}, headnote"

    In deciding whether in any particular case a police officer had used more force than was reasonably necessary to prevent an escape within the meaning of s. 25(4) of the *Criminal Code*, **general statements as to the duty to take care to avoid injury to others made in negligence cases could not be accepted as applicable without reservation unless full weight was given to the fact that the act complained of was one done under statutory powers and in pursuance of a statutory duty.**

    The performance of the duty imposed upon police officers to arrest offenders who have committed a crime and are fleeing to avoid arrest may, at times and of necessity, involve risk of injury to other members of the community. Such risk, in the absence of a negligent or unreasonable exercise of such duty is *damnum sine injuria* (**"damage without legal injury"**).

    If the circumstances are such that the legislature must have contemplated that the exercise of a statutory power and the discharge of a statutory duty might interfere with private rights and the person to whom the power is given and upon whom the duty is imposed acts reasonably, **such interference will not give rise to an action**. In this case, the action of P was reasonably necessary and no more, both to prevent the escape and to protect those persons whose safety might have been endangered if the escaping car had reached the approaching intersection. So far as P was concerned, the fact that the bullet struck S was simply an accident.

### 2. Determining whether the standard was breached

**Probability**

In ***Bolton v Stone*** [1951] A.C. 850 (H.L.), the Court focused mainly on the **probability factor**. As the House of Lords notes, **simple foreseeability of a risk occurring is not enough to spur the reasonable person to take action** to avoid the risk (foreseeability defined duty of care, especially in 1951, before ***Anns*** added policy factors). 

A reasonable person, said the Court, only responds (i.e., takes care) with respect to **substantial or probable risks**. 

The risk of the cricket ball leaving the field and hitting someone on a nearby road was of very low probability. See the numbers at the start of the decision on how often balls had escaped from the park—and the fact that no one outside the park had been hit in 90 years. Therefore the cricket club was not negligent in not taking steps to avoid this injury.

Probability is not the only factor the Court discusses as the seriousness of the consequences comes up. And the **severity of harm** did play an implicit role in the reasoning: at that distance, the ball was not travelling so fast, and in fact the woman’s injury was not severe.

The Court expressly talks about **the cost of avoiding harm**, but says it should play no role here: if there is too great a likelihood of risk, the Court says, then cricket should not be played here. Don’t read too much into that part of the decision. **Later courts have not taken it as a rejection of the role of the “B” part of the calculation of reasonable risk.** 

**Severity of loss**

In ***Paris v Stepney Borough Council*** [1951] A.C. 367 (H.L.), the Court had to consider the case of a one-eyed man who was injured at work. A splinter from an elevated chassis he was working on hit him in his good eye and blinded him. The majority said **it was relevant to consider the individual circumstances** of each employee, including any disabilities, **when assessing the gravity of any risk**. 

The seriousness of the risk in his case meant the employer should have taken precautions such as supplying goggles. The employer was negligent for not doing so. Note that the court emphasizes that the employer knew this worker had one eye: if a worker had a risk-heightening condition that the employer did not know about, the result might have been different.

**Burden: cost of avoiding or reducing risk to others**

Finally, on burden side of the balancing act: it is clear from case law that, despite that comment in ***Bolton***, **if the cost of avoiding risk is small compared to the likelihood of serious injury, then a “reasonable person” would take those preventive measures**. 

The Supreme Court addressed this issue in ***Ware's Taxi Ltd. v. Gilliham***, [1949 CanLII 42 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/22vsx){:target=" \_blank"}. The key point from the case is that the Court found that the Defendant negligent based on their ruling that the precautionary measure of childproof locks were relatively inexpensive, practical and could’ve prevented the child’s injury during transport.

The cost of avoiding risk is important in cases in which the defendant was faced with the danger of personal injury and whose act of avoiding that risk wound up creating a risk for others. In these cases, **the balancing is between the risk of injury to the defendant** (which counts as a “cost”) and **the risk of injury to others**.

!!! info inline "Animal on road"

    There are many “animal on road” cases in which the courts dealt with a driver who swerved to avoid collision with an animal on the road, or some other obstruction. The act of swerving creates a risk to those on the side of the road, or in the oncoming lane.

    In these cases, the courts have given little weight to the defendant’s wish to avoid hurting an animal or avoid damage to the defendant’s car. **In general courts have concluded that defendants did not breach the standard of care when the animal or obstruction was large enough to create a definite risk or injury to the defendant**.
![animal on road](../pics/image-4.png)


**Burden: utility of defendant’s activity**

As noted above, when considering the cost of risk avoidance, the courts have looked at more than just cost in assessing the burden on the defendant to have taken preventive measures. If the activity in question is **socially worthwhile**, that is a factor which militates in favour of a finding of no negligence. Generally, this factor is only considered in claims against government or public authorities, such as police officers, ambulance drivers, fire authorities, etc. 

Note that in ***Priestman*** the officer was firing a gun at a teenaged suspect’s car tire during a high-speed chase, trying to get him to stop. The suspect was hit by mistake, and drove into the plaintiffs, who were innocently waiting for a bus. You can debate whether the importance of catching that suspect at that moment outweighed the risk created by this action-movie move by the officer, but the court said yes. As discussed in Notes 25 and 26, **in cases involving public activities such as a volunteer firefighting, the Court has held that a lower standard, even a subjective one, may be appropriate**.

The “utility” aspect of burden is not relevant only to cases involving public authorities but as Osborne notes also has a general influence in all negligence cases. 

The case referenced in Note 27, ***The Scout Association v. Barnes***, [2010] EWCA Civ 1476, is not required reading for this module. However the discussion in that case of the social value of an activity - and when the risks of an activity outweigh any social benefit – provide an interesting glimpse into how courts weigh the utility of an activity, and how activities can be modified to make them more dangerous.

**Custom**

**Courts have generally held that conforming to general practice or custom usually dispels a claim of negligence**, that is, doing so is strong evidence of reasonable conduct. Nonetheless, even an established practice is open to question by the trier of fact and courts must decide how much weight to give to evidence of following established custom or practice. **If the custom is itself is unreasonable and fraught with obvious risks, the practice or custom will not provide a defence.**

However, if the practice involves complex, scientific or highly technical matters beyond the ken of ordinary experience, the trier of fact is **not allowed to find the practice itself unreasonable** (e.g., where medical practices are involved). In these cases, once the custom is established through expert evidence, **the only issue for the trier of fact to decide is whether the practice was followed by the defendant**. This was recognized by the Supreme Court in ***Ter Neuzen v. Korn***, [1995 CanLII 72 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1frhk){:target=" \_blank"}. That decision also has a good discussion of when a negligence finding may be made, even in situations where a medical profession follows standard medical practice.

Canadian courts have taken notice of economic analysis however it has not been widely adopted in Canadian cases. In many of the cases we have seen too that there are **inherent issues of fairness**, which, although the law purports to be dispassionate, undoubtedly influences judges. 

And again, the concept of highlight bias – the idea that **past events are often overestimated** in their predictability or probability – has been shown in psychological studies (see Note 41). Judges are only human and in negligence actions in particular the human factor quite often weighs heavily against law’s weight in a judgment.

---

If a person does not behave as a reasonable person would in similar circumstances, that person has breached the standard of care. Courts would find that the person’s conduct fell below the standard of care, making the person negligent.

How does the court determine what a reasonable person would have done? There are many factors a court considers. Generally, a **risk/cost analysis** is applied, to compare the probability of harm against the cost of avoiding the risk. Courts also take other factors into consideration in determining the reasonable standard, including whether **a custom or statutory duty** was breached or complied with. Still other factors depend on the defendant’s circumstances (**age**, **physical disability**, **profession**, etc.).

Unreasonable Risk: The Risk vs. Burden Analysis

To measure the **Standard of Care**, the court considers four factors:

- **Probability** (some judges say foreseeability, but that’s not the best word, since it conjures up duty of care and proximate cause) of the injury occurring as a result of the defendant’s conduct
- **Severity** or magnitude of the loss threatened by the defendant’s activity
- **Cost** of avoiding the risk
- **Social utility** of the defendant’s conduct

The first two can, together, be called the “**risk**.” Courts balance them against the last two, which you can call the “**burden**.” 

The greater the risk, the more likely a person will be found negligent if the person took no steps to avoid the risk. On the other hand, the greater the cost of avoiding the risk, and the more socially beneficial the defendant’s conduct, the more likely a court will find no breach of the standard of care if no avoidance measures were taken.

I include the last factor, social utility, under the heading of “burden” because the courts keep in mind this concern: if they set the standard of care too high, they will stop certain activities from being carried out, or prevent them from being carried out in an effective manner. That amounts to an “opportunity cost” not just to this defendant but, often, to society. For example, see ***Priestman*** (p. 34).

Not all cases explicitly consider all of these factors. Some judges focus on just one or two, and often in language that doesn’t make these factors explicit. But you will often see judges speak of balancing interests: those of the plaintiff in being safe, and those of the defendant in doing some activity. The factors above break that balancing act down.

!!! danger "Module 3 - Topic 2: Practice Question"

    1. From the options below, select the two standard of care factors that courts consider at "risk": (choose all that apply)
        - [x] Severity of loss threatened or affected by Defendant's activity
        - [ ] Cost of avoiding the risk
        - [x] Probability of the injury occurring as a result of the defendant's conduct
        - [ ] Any social utility of the defendant's conduct

## Topic 2: Special Situations Affecting Standard of Care

We know that the test for determining standard of care is **what the reasonable person acting prudently would have done in the circumstances**. There are, however, certain **classes of people** for whom the courts have developed **special rules** for the standard of care required of them. These include: **minors**, **professionals**, and **mentally or physically disabled** persons. 

The next section of readings (at pp. 43-50) is on these special rules. Following this we will turn to the readings and review the level of proof required for establishing negligence (at pp. 50-54).

!!! info "*Fiala v. Cechmanek*, [1999 ABQB 489 (CanLII)](https://canlii.ca/t/5p3n){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - [18] The question then becomes whether Mr. MacDonald’s actions are to be **excused because of his mental incapacity** at the time of the incident.
    - [28] Interestingly enough, the Court of Appeal went on to say:

        > In order to succeed the patient would have to prove a sudden reversal of facts. **First,** he would have to prove that when he was well enough mentally that he could be liable for negligence, he had no reason to foresee any danger from his possessing an automobile or car keys or not taking his medication. **Then** he would have to prove a sudden change in condition, his suddenly becoming too insane to be liable for negligence, and that that condition continued without let-up until the time of the collision.

    - [29] In this case I am quite satisfied that Mr. MacDonald has satisfied the onus resting upon him. He has proven, through the evidence of all three psychiatrists as well as his own testimony, that there was no reason to foresee any danger that he might be undergoing or be on the verge of a manic episode. While he had exhibited symptoms which were obvious to the psychiatrists, there were symptoms not recognized by himself or his wife as being anything other than a little bit out of the norm.
    - [30] Mr. MacDonald has gone on to prove to me that without any warning or notice whatsoever, there was suddenly an absolute change in his condition and that he, to use the words of our Court of Appeal, “suddenly became too insane to be liable for negligence.” There is no doubt in my mind but that at the time of the incident Mr. MacDonald had no ability to reason and to appreciate his duty of care to others.
    - [31] ... Tort law may well be based upon the principle of compensation, but it is also founded upon the duty of care to those who we ought reasonably foresee may be harmed by our actions. **Foreseeability remains a fundamental basis for actions of negligence.** To allow the Fialas’ action would be to impose strict liability upon Mr. MacDonald for an “unintended and non-negligent harm (no-fault liability)”. (Fleming, page 7). **We have not reached the position of a no-fault compensation scheme.** We have not yet become strictly liable for all of our actions in all instances.
    - [32] The action against Mr. MacDonald must therefore be **dismissed**.
    - [33] With respect to Ms. Cechmanek, I am also satisfied beyond any doubt that her reaction to Mr. MacDonald’s uncontrolled actions on March 11, 1995 was **an uncontrollable and involuntary act**. As stated by Nathanson, J. in ***Broghm-O’Keefe v. Taylor***, [1991] N.S.J. No. 109: “**Inevitable accident, accordingly, is that which the party charged with the offence could not possibly prevent by the exercise of ordinary care, caution and skill.**” This is, in my respectful view, no different from the situation in ***Boutcher v. Stewart*** (1989), 1989 CanLII 7717 (NB CA), 14 M.V.R. (2nd) 221 wherein the New Brunswick Court of Appeal found that the defendant who was struck in the head by a bird which rendered him momentarily stunned was not liable. ...Here, I find that there was no possible way in which Ms. Cechmanek could have anticipated the actions of Mr. MacDonald. Her reactions were completely involuntary and caused by the panic of the situation. 

**Special Standards**

**“Special standards” are essentially about exceptions to the general rule, the “reasonable person test”.** 

For certain classes of defendant, the standard may be **lower or higher** than the general one. 

- In the first two categories here the standard is lower: for those with **mental or physical disabilities**; and for **children**. 
- After that we will examine the higher standard expected of **professionals**.

**The Mentally Disabled**

As you may have inferred from the previous section, law and ethics often co-exist uneasily. As Osborne notes, few cases raise considerations of fairness to a higher degree than determining the standard of care and liability of mentally incapacitated defendants.

In Fiala, the Court discusses at length the policy arguments for and against holding the mentally disabled to the reasonable person standard. Paras 24-27 summarize four distinct arguments against lowering the standard—that is, arguments in favour of holding the mentally disabled to the standard of a reasonable person. The first is that compensation is the primary goal of negligence law, but the arguments also focus on the responsibility of caregivers (para 26) and the risk of isolating disabled people if they are known to carry no responsibility for their actions (para 27). The Court then goes through each of these arguments, at paras 29-36, knocking then down one after the other.

Ultimately, the Court concludes that the requirement of fault is too important for liability in negligence. A person who suffers from a mental disability should not be held liable if the person was not at fault. The Court did not apply a special standard of care to assess the conduct of the defendant, Mr MacDonald. Rather, the Court assessed whether Mr MacDonald was capable of being “at fault” by applying a twofold capacity test. The Court sets out the test at para 49. Note the start of the test, which is easy to miss: “when a defendant is afflicted suddenly and without warning”. I will return to this part of the test below. In this case, MacDonald’s affliction was sudden, so the Court asks the two capacity questions:

Did MacDonald understand or appreciate the duty of care the law imposes on people? Or:
Was he capable of meeting the required standard of care (the reasonable person test)?
If the answer is “no” to either question, there is no liability. However, if the answer is yes to both questions, then the mentally disabled person will be judged according to the ordinary standard of care of a reasonable person. In other words, if capacity is established, no modified or special standard is applied—unlike the case with children. In this case, McDonald met both tests, so he was not liable (at para 54).

McDonald’s case is rare, however. To meet the test applied in Fiala, the defendant must show that the disability was so severe that the defendant lost the capacity to understand the duty of care, or that the defendant lost control to such a degree that the defendant could not take care. McDonald did satisfy the test in this case, but this case is, I imagine you would agree, rather extreme. The case also has its comical aspects, despite the seriousness of the defendant’s mental break, and the injuries of his victims. I invite you to reread paras 2 and 3 of the decision and imagine the judge’s job: acting as a sober authority while also finding a way to describe the facts with a degree of literary flair.

On a more serious note, an example of a person who may have had the capacity for a duty of care (question 1), but who lost the capacity to meet the standard (question 2) is the Buckley v. Smith Transport Ltd. [1946] O.R. 798Links to an external site. (C.A.) case, described in the text (at 44) and in Fiala at para 43. In Buckley, the defendant was struck with the “insane delusion that his truck was being powered by a remote control”.

There is, however, a range of views in Canadian case law on what the law is with respect to the mentally handicapped. The capacity test may be appropriate for cases of serious incapacity, but the Canadian position becomes muddled when it comes to people with less serious mental disabilities. Should they be judged according to a modified standard (e.g., the standard of a reasonable person with that disability)? According to U.S. and U.K. authority, there is never a modified standard for mentally disabled persons—as long as they have capacity, they must live up to the standard of a reasonable person. That is the rule the Court followed in Fiala (since the twofold test is about the person’s capacity, and if the person has capacity, the reasonable person standard applies). Whether this is a good legal policy is a matter for debate. Although Fiala is considered to be a leading case on the issue in Canada, there are other Canadian cases that seem to apply lower standards in some cases of mental illness.

A Note Regarding Other (Physical) Illness: What about other kinds of illness? Should a person be liable in negligence if they suddenly suffer an illness, such as a heart attack, and injure a third party? Although the text includes a discussion of the case of Slattery v Haley (1922), 52 O.L.R. 95Links to an external site. (C.A.). under mental disability (at 44) this is not a mental illness situation. However it is similar to a person not having the capacity to be aware of a duty to others at that time due to the sudden illness. In such cases, the person would not be liable—unless the person was aware of the risk of this condition. Recall Fiala at 49: “when a defendant is afflicted suddenly and without warning”. That part of the twofold test means that if you know you have a serious mental illness that could cause you to lose control, you will be legally responsible for the harm you cause. Likewise, if you have a condition that could cause a heart attack at any moment, you will be liable. So in the Slattery case the defendant was not liable for an accident caused by a sudden illness that left him unconscious at the wheel because of his lack of volition and the evidence that he had no previous symptoms.
