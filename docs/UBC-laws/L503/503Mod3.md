# Standard of Care and Special Standards

## Overview

In the previous module you were introduced to the elements of negligence and the specific element of the duty of care. In this module we will examine the next negligence element, **the standard of care**. We will cover the **ordinary** and **special** standard of care owed to others and the **burden proof** in negligence claims.

## Topic 1: The Standard of Care and The Reasonable Person

<p class="highlight blue" markdown="1">*The reasonable man adapts himself to the world; the unreasonable one persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man.* <br><br>
- **George Bernard Shaw**</p>

The next negligence element we will discuss is the standard of care. This is usually the most **commonly litigated issue** of all the elements in a negligence lawsuit, i.e., the aspect of a negligence claim that is most often in dispute, and therefore takes up the most time in court. In many cases (for example, in motor vehicle accident cases), it is clear that the defendant owes a duty of care to the plaintiff. 

The question really in issue in most negligence cases is **whether the defendant breached the standard of care on the facts in that case**. As noted above, there are two questions to be answered under standard of care:

- What is the **test for the standard of care**? This is **a question of law** for judges (not juries) to determine, and an appeal court can reverse the lower court’s decision if the appeal court disagrees with the lower court’s definition of the test.
- **Was that standard breached**? In other words, was the defendant negligent (“negligent” here is used in the narrow sense we saw earlier). This is **a question of fact** for the trier-of-fact: either the jury, or, if there is no jury, the judge. Appeal courts generally won’t overturn trial court decisions on questions of fact, unless there was some error of law in the way the trial court applied the rule to the facts. In some rare cases of “**palpable and overriding error**” on the facts, the appeal court may also reverse a trial court’s factual finding. 

There will be further discussion of what constitutes a “palpable and overriding error” in a case we will read later in the course, ***Galaske v. O'Donnell***, [1994 CanLII 128 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1frvm){:target=" \_blank"}.

In this Module we discuss the **general rule**, which applies to most people most of the time: 

> the reasonable person of ordinary intelligence, acting prudently and taking reasonable steps to avoid putting others at risk. 

I will focus on the general rule, known as the “reasonable person” standard, and on reasonable vs. unreasonable risk (which is critical in courts’ analysis of whether the standard was breached). The other cases in this week’s readings are on situations in which an external source helps to define the standard: **custom or statute**.

### 1. General Rule for Standard of Care: Reasonable Person Test

The test used to measure the standard of care in most cases is, in short, the “reasonable person” test. When the law measures a person’s behaviour by this standard, it is applying an objective test or standard. By contrast, when the law is concerned only with a specific person’s actual behaviour or thoughts, the courts are applying a subjective test. Our first case illustrates the difference.

As Osborne notes in our text, ***Vaughan v Menlove*** (1837, UK) authoritatively established the standard of care for a reasonable person. In ***Vaughan***, the court stated that a breach of standard of care would depend on whether the defendant “**proceeded with such reasonable caution as a prudent man would have exercised under such circumstances**.” It did not matter that the defendant may have been of below-average intelligence, or that he acted honestly and *bona fide* (in good faith) to the best of his own judgement.

**Tindal CJ** rejects the subjective test as being, well, too subjective. The court did not ask, “did this man do his best to take care, given what he knows?” Instead, it asked: what would the reasonable person have done in the situation? In the eyes of the law, doing your best ain’t enough.

However, the law usually requires **experts** to meet a **higher standard**, when doing the thing at which they have expertise. There are also exceptions for certain public service workers (i.e. volunteer firefighters) who may be held to a lower standard due to the nature of their activities

The central element in applying standard of care is **foreseeability** of the risk of injury to others. The text references several cases involving children injured when into contact with high voltage electrical wires, including ***Gloster*** and ***Amos***.

***Gloster*** in particular implies that a defendant who chooses to be wilfully blind, that is, to not to seek out information that would help the person to be more careful, would not avoid liability. In ***Amos***, the defendants unsuccessfully tried to argue that the risk was not foreseeable. The defendants relied on ***Moule v New Brunswick (Electric Power Commission)*** (1960), 24 D.L.R. (2d) 305 (S.C.C.). However, the key difference is that in ***Moule*** the defendant had taken some action to try to remove the reasonable risk of danger.

In summary, the application of the standard depends on all the circumstances of a particular case. **It is about what the reasonable person would do if that person had been in the position of the defendant, with the information available to the defendant.** The reasonable, prudent person would seek out such information, taking reasonable steps to obtain it. Failing to do so amounts to negligence.

    The defendant company transmitting such a dangerous element as electricity through their wires thus strung along a public highway fall short of being insurers, but **are bound to exercise the greatest possible care** and to use every possible precaution for the protection of the public.

    Their wires in the condition in which they were at the time and place where the boy was so badly injured constituted a danger to those using the highway and were in fact a ***nuisance***. 
    
    They had become worn and defective and had ceased to be insulated and to offer any protection in case they came into contact with any one. These uninsulated wires were within a few inches, between 14 and 20, of the railing of the bridge, and **it ought to have been present to the minds of the defendant company** that if not grown up people at any rate children crossing the bridge or playing upon it would be exceedingly likely to touch the wires. 
    
    To my mind the maintenance of these dangerous uninsulated wires charged with deadly electricity within a few inches of the bridge over which a large number of people daily passed for some months after its re-construction had been completed, and coupled with the other facts proved, fully **justified** the findings of the jury.

!!! info "*Amos v. New Brunswick Electric Power Commission*, [1976 CanLII 160 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1z6fm){:target=" \_blank"}, headnote"

    The respondent and others who erect electric lines carrying heavy charges have a duty to take proper precautions against injury resulting therefrom. 
    
    As the trial judge noted the poplar is a fast growing tree. That fast growing tree stood directly beneath lines running along the top of poles and carrying up to 7,200 volts. The only evidence as to an attempt to keep the tree from these lines was that it was stated to be the practice of the power company to trim such trees every four to seven years and that so far as the company’s inspector knew that practice had been kept up in reference to the particular tree. 
    
    The wires were at least 30 ft. above the ground and any contact with them could have been avoided by the simple expedient of cutting off the top of the tree. It was left uncut and its mid-summer foliage concealed the presence of the wires from a boy carrying out the perfectly normal play activity of climbing a tree. **The accident could have been foreseen** and was almost inevitable given active boys and that the tree was directly in front of their home.

!!! info "*Priestman v. Colangelo, Shynall and Smythson*, [1959 CanLII 14 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1tvpf){:target=" \_blank"}, headnote"

    In deciding whether in any particular case a police officer had used more force than was reasonably necessary to prevent an escape within the meaning of s. 25(4) of the *Criminal Code*, **general statements as to the duty to take care to avoid injury to others made in negligence cases could not be accepted as applicable without reservation unless full weight was given to the fact that the act complained of was one done under statutory powers and in pursuance of a statutory duty.**

    The performance of the duty imposed upon police officers to arrest offenders who have committed a crime and are fleeing to avoid arrest may, at times and of necessity, involve risk of injury to other members of the community. Such risk, in the absence of a negligent or unreasonable exercise of such duty is *damnum sine injuria* (**"damage without legal injury"**).

    If the circumstances are such that the legislature must have contemplated that the exercise of a statutory power and the discharge of a statutory duty might interfere with private rights and the person to whom the power is given and upon whom the duty is imposed acts reasonably, **such interference will not give rise to an action**. In this case, the action of P was reasonably necessary and no more, both to prevent the escape and to protect those persons whose safety might have been endangered if the escaping car had reached the approaching intersection. So far as P was concerned, the fact that the bullet struck S was simply an accident.

### 2. Determining whether the standard was breached

**Probability**

In ***Bolton v Stone*** [1951] A.C. 850 (H.L.), the Court focused mainly on the **probability factor**. As the House of Lords notes, **simple foreseeability of a risk occurring is not enough to spur the reasonable person to take action** to avoid the risk (foreseeability defined duty of care, especially in 1951, before ***Anns*** added policy factors). 

A reasonable person, said the Court, only responds (i.e., takes care) with respect to **substantial or probable risks**. 

The risk of the cricket ball leaving the field and hitting someone on a nearby road was of very low probability. See the numbers at the start of the decision on how often balls had escaped from the park—and the fact that no one outside the park had been hit in 90 years. Therefore the cricket club was not negligent in not taking steps to avoid this injury.

Probability is not the only factor the Court discusses as the seriousness of the consequences comes up. And the **severity of harm** did play an implicit role in the reasoning: at that distance, the ball was not travelling so fast, and in fact the woman’s injury was not severe.

The Court expressly talks about **the cost of avoiding harm**, but says it should play no role here: if there is too great a likelihood of risk, the Court says, then cricket should not be played here. Don’t read too much into that part of the decision. **Later courts have not taken it as a rejection of the role of the “B” part of the calculation of reasonable risk.** 

**Severity of loss**

In ***Paris v Stepney Borough Council*** [1951] A.C. 367 (H.L.), the Court had to consider the case of a one-eyed man who was injured at work. A splinter from an elevated chassis he was working on hit him in his good eye and blinded him. The majority said **it was relevant to consider the individual circumstances** of each employee, including any disabilities, **when assessing the gravity of any risk**. 

The seriousness of the risk in his case meant the employer should have taken precautions such as supplying goggles. The employer was negligent for not doing so. Note that the court emphasizes that the employer knew this worker had one eye: if a worker had a risk-heightening condition that the employer did not know about, the result might have been different.

**Burden: cost of avoiding or reducing risk to others**

Finally, on burden side of the balancing act: it is clear from case law that, despite that comment in ***Bolton***, **if the cost of avoiding risk is small compared to the likelihood of serious injury, then a “reasonable person” would take those preventive measures**. 

The Supreme Court addressed this issue in ***Ware's Taxi Ltd. v. Gilliham***, [1949 CanLII 42 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/22vsx){:target=" \_blank"}. The key point from the case is that the Court found that the Defendant negligent based on their ruling that the precautionary measure of childproof locks were relatively inexpensive, practical and could’ve prevented the child’s injury during transport.

The cost of avoiding risk is important in cases in which the defendant was faced with the danger of personal injury and whose act of avoiding that risk wound up creating a risk for others. In these cases, **the balancing is between the risk of injury to the defendant** (which counts as a “cost”) and **the risk of injury to others**.

!!! info inline "Animal on road"

    There are many “animal on road” cases in which the courts dealt with a driver who swerved to avoid collision with an animal on the road, or some other obstruction. The act of swerving creates a risk to those on the side of the road, or in the oncoming lane.

    In these cases, the courts have given little weight to the defendant’s wish to avoid hurting an animal or avoid damage to the defendant’s car. **In general courts have concluded that defendants did not breach the standard of care when the animal or obstruction was large enough to create a definite risk or injury to the defendant**.
![animal on road](../pics/image-4.png)


**Burden: utility of defendant’s activity**

As noted above, when considering the cost of risk avoidance, the courts have looked at more than just cost in assessing the burden on the defendant to have taken preventive measures. If the activity in question is **socially worthwhile**, that is a factor which militates in favour of a finding of no negligence. Generally, this factor is only considered in claims against government or public authorities, such as police officers, ambulance drivers, fire authorities, etc. 

Note that in ***Priestman*** the officer was firing a gun at a teenaged suspect’s car tire during a high-speed chase, trying to get him to stop. The suspect was hit by mistake, and drove into the plaintiffs, who were innocently waiting for a bus. You can debate whether the importance of catching that suspect at that moment outweighed the risk created by this action-movie move by the officer, but the court said yes. As discussed in Notes 25 and 26, **in cases involving public activities such as a volunteer firefighting, the Court has held that a lower standard, even a subjective one, may be appropriate**.

The “utility” aspect of burden is not relevant only to cases involving public authorities but as Osborne notes also has a general influence in all negligence cases. 

The case referenced in Note 27, ***The Scout Association v. Barnes***, [2010] EWCA Civ 1476, is not required reading for this module. However the discussion in that case of the social value of an activity - and when the risks of an activity outweigh any social benefit – provide an interesting glimpse into how courts weigh the utility of an activity, and how activities can be modified to make them more dangerous.

**Custom**

**Courts have generally held that conforming to general practice or custom usually dispels a claim of negligence**, that is, doing so is strong evidence of reasonable conduct. Nonetheless, even an established practice is open to question by the trier of fact and courts must decide how much weight to give to evidence of following established custom or practice. **If the custom is itself is unreasonable and fraught with obvious risks, the practice or custom will not provide a defence.**

However, if the practice involves complex, scientific or highly technical matters beyond the ken of ordinary experience, the trier of fact is **not allowed to find the practice itself unreasonable** (e.g., where medical practices are involved). In these cases, once the custom is established through expert evidence, **the only issue for the trier of fact to decide is whether the practice was followed by the defendant**. This was recognized by the Supreme Court in ***Ter Neuzen v. Korn***, [1995 CanLII 72 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1frhk){:target=" \_blank"}. That decision also has a good discussion of when a negligence finding may be made, even in situations where a medical profession follows standard medical practice.

Canadian courts have taken notice of economic analysis however it has not been widely adopted in Canadian cases. In many of the cases we have seen too that there are **inherent issues of fairness**, which, although the law purports to be dispassionate, undoubtedly influences judges. 

And again, the concept of highlight bias – the idea that **past events are often overestimated** in their predictability or probability – has been shown in psychological studies (see Note 41). Judges are only human and in negligence actions in particular the human factor quite often weighs heavily against law’s weight in a judgment.

---

If a person does not behave as a reasonable person would in similar circumstances, that person has breached the standard of care. Courts would find that the person’s conduct fell below the standard of care, making the person negligent.

How does the court determine what a reasonable person would have done? There are many factors a court considers. Generally, a **risk/cost analysis** is applied, to compare the probability of harm against the cost of avoiding the risk. Courts also take other factors into consideration in determining the reasonable standard, including whether **a custom or statutory duty** was breached or complied with. Still other factors depend on the defendant’s circumstances (**age**, **physical disability**, **profession**, etc.).

Unreasonable Risk: The Risk vs. Burden Analysis

To measure the **Standard of Care**, the court considers four factors:

- **Probability** (some judges say foreseeability, but that’s not the best word, since it conjures up duty of care and proximate cause) of the injury occurring as a result of the defendant’s conduct
- **Severity** or magnitude of the loss threatened by the defendant’s activity
- **Cost** of avoiding the risk
- **Social utility** of the defendant’s conduct

The first two can, together, be called the “**risk**.” Courts balance them against the last two, which you can call the “**burden**.” 

The greater the risk, the more likely a person will be found negligent if the person took no steps to avoid the risk. On the other hand, the greater the cost of avoiding the risk, and the more socially beneficial the defendant’s conduct, the more likely a court will find no breach of the standard of care if no avoidance measures were taken.

I include the last factor, social utility, under the heading of “burden” because the courts keep in mind this concern: if they set the standard of care too high, they will stop certain activities from being carried out, or prevent them from being carried out in an effective manner. That amounts to an “opportunity cost” not just to this defendant but, often, to society. For example, see ***Priestman*** (p. 34).

Not all cases explicitly consider all of these factors. Some judges focus on just one or two, and often in language that doesn’t make these factors explicit. But you will often see judges speak of balancing interests: those of the plaintiff in being safe, and those of the defendant in doing some activity. The factors above break that balancing act down.

!!! danger "Module 3 - Topic 2: Practice Question"

    1. From the options below, select the two standard of care factors that courts consider at "risk": (choose all that apply)
        - [x] Severity of loss threatened or affected by Defendant's activity
        - [ ] Cost of avoiding the risk
        - [x] Probability of the injury occurring as a result of the defendant's conduct
        - [ ] Any social utility of the defendant's conduct

## Topic 2: Special Situations Affecting Standard of Care

We know that the test for determining standard of care is **what the reasonable person acting prudently would have done in the circumstances**. There are, however, certain **classes of people** for whom the courts have developed **special rules** for the standard of care required of them. These include: **minors**, **professionals**, and **mentally or physically disabled** persons. 

The next section of readings (at pp. 43-50) is on these special rules. Following this we will turn to the readings and review the level of proof required for establishing negligence (at pp. 50-54).

!!! info "*Fiala v. Cechmanek*, [1999 ABQB 489 (CanLII)](https://canlii.ca/t/5p3n){:target=" \_blank"}"

    - [18] The question then becomes whether Mr. MacDonald’s actions are to be **excused because of his mental incapacity** at the time of the incident.
    - [28] Interestingly enough, the Court of Appeal went on to say:

        > In order to succeed the patient would have to prove a sudden reversal of facts. **First,** he would have to prove that when he was well enough mentally that he could be liable for negligence, he had no reason to foresee any danger from his possessing an automobile or car keys or not taking his medication. **Then** he would have to prove a sudden change in condition, his suddenly becoming too insane to be liable for negligence, and that that condition continued without let-up until the time of the collision.

    - [29] In this case I am quite satisfied that Mr. MacDonald has satisfied the onus resting upon him. He has proven, through the evidence of all three psychiatrists as well as his own testimony, that there was no reason to foresee any danger that he might be undergoing or be on the verge of a manic episode. While he had exhibited symptoms which were obvious to the psychiatrists, there were symptoms not recognized by himself or his wife as being anything other than a little bit out of the norm.
    - [30] Mr. MacDonald has gone on to prove to me that without any warning or notice whatsoever, there was suddenly an absolute change in his condition and that he, to use the words of our Court of Appeal, “suddenly became too insane to be liable for negligence.” There is no doubt in my mind but that at the time of the incident Mr. MacDonald had no ability to reason and to appreciate his duty of care to others.
    - [31] ... Tort law may well be based upon the principle of compensation, but it is also founded upon the duty of care to those who we ought reasonably foresee may be harmed by our actions. **Foreseeability remains a fundamental basis for actions of negligence.** To allow the Fialas’ action would be to impose strict liability upon Mr. MacDonald for an “unintended and non-negligent harm (no-fault liability)”. (Fleming, page 7). **We have not reached the position of a no-fault compensation scheme.** We have not yet become strictly liable for all of our actions in all instances.
    - [32] The action against Mr. MacDonald must therefore be **dismissed**.
    - [33] With respect to Ms. Cechmanek, I am also satisfied beyond any doubt that her reaction to Mr. MacDonald’s uncontrolled actions on March 11, 1995 was **an uncontrollable and involuntary act**. As stated by Nathanson, J. in ***Broghm-O’Keefe v. Taylor***, [1991] N.S.J. No. 109: “**Inevitable accident, accordingly, is that which the party charged with the offence could not possibly prevent by the exercise of ordinary care, caution and skill.**” This is, in my respectful view, no different from the situation in ***Boutcher v. Stewart*** (1989), 1989 CanLII 7717 (NB CA), 14 M.V.R. (2nd) 221 wherein the New Brunswick Court of Appeal found that the defendant who was struck in the head by a bird which rendered him momentarily stunned was not liable. ...Here, I find that there was no possible way in which Ms. Cechmanek could have anticipated the actions of Mr. MacDonald. Her reactions were completely involuntary and caused by the panic of the situation. 

**Special Standards**

**“Special standards” are essentially about exceptions to the general rule, the “reasonable person test”.** 

For certain classes of defendant, the standard may be **lower or higher** than the general one. 

- In the first two categories here the standard is lower: for those with **mental or physical disabilities**; and for **children**. 
- After that we will examine the higher standard expected of **professionals**.

**The Mentally Disabled**

In ***Fiala***, the Court discusses at length the policy arguments for and against holding the mentally disabled to the reasonable person standard. 

Ultimately, the Court concludes that the **requirement of fault is too important for liability in negligence**. A person who suffers from a mental disability should **not be held liable** if the person was not at fault. 

In this case, MacDonald’s affliction was sudden, so the Court asks the two capacity questions:

- Did MacDonald understand or appreciate the duty of care the law imposes on people? Or:
- Was he capable of meeting the required standard of care (the reasonable person test)?

If the answer is “no” to either question, there is no liability. However, if the answer is yes to both questions, then the mentally disabled person will be judged according to the ordinary standard of care of a reasonable person. 

The capacity test may be appropriate for cases of serious incapacity, but the Canadian position becomes muddled when it comes to people with less serious mental disabilities. Should they be judged according to a modified standard (e.g., the standard of a reasonable person with that disability)? According to U.S. and U.K. authority, there is never a modified standard for mentally disabled persons, **as long as they have capacity, they must live up to the standard of a reasonable person.** That is the rule the Court followed in ***Fiala*** (since the twofold test is about the person’s capacity, and if the person has capacity, the reasonable person standard applies). 

Whether this is a good legal policy is a matter for debate. Although ***Fiala*** is considered to be a leading case on the issue in Canada, there are other Canadian cases that seem to apply **lower standards** in some cases of mental illness.

A Note Regarding Other (Physical) Illness: What about other kinds of illness? Should a person be liable in negligence if they suddenly suffer an illness, such as a heart attack, and injure a third party? Although the text includes a discussion of the case of ***Slattery v Haley (1922)***, 52 O.L.R. 95 (C.A.). under mental disability (at 44) this is not a mental illness situation. However it is similar to a person not having the capacity to be aware of a duty to others at that time due to the sudden illness. **In such cases, the person would not be liable, unless the person was aware of the risk of this condition.** 

Recall ***Fiala*** at 49: “when a defendant is afflicted suddenly and without warning”. That part of the twofold test means that if you know you have a serious mental illness that could cause you to lose control, you will be legally responsible for the harm you cause. Likewise, if you have a condition that could cause a heart attack at any moment, you will be liable. So in the ***Slattery*** case the defendant was not liable for an accident caused by a sudden illness that left him unconscious at the wheel because of his lack of volition and the evidence that he had no previous symptoms.

**Children**

For cases involving children, Canadian courts have adopted **a modified standard of care**. This modified standard of care combines objective and subjective tests, but is not quite a subjective test. It is based on what a reasonable or ordinary child would do (the **objective** part of the test) in the shoes of the particular child in question (considering that child’s age, intelligence and experience, the **subjective** part of the test). 

This rule is discussed in the text (at 45) and comes from a 1956 SCC decision called ***McEllistrum v. Etches***, [1956 CanLII 103 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/22xw4){:target=" \_blank"}. The test applied is still the test today.

As for what “**experience**” means, this can include the child’s past activities (and their consequences). It can also include a specific instruction that this child has received. Again, though, the test is not what this child thought was the right thing to do, having received such instruction, but what a reasonable child of the same age and intelligence would do if given those instructions, and having similar experience as this child.

The lower standard of care will not apply to all minors, however. If the child is involved in an “**adult activity**” such as driving a car or boat or even a snowmobile, the standard of care is that of a “reasonably careful adult” (at 47). **In most cases, the adult activity rule applies to the operation of machinery ordinarily operated by an adult.**

**Parents are not** **vicariously liable** for the negligence of their child, **unless the plaintiff can prove that a parent was negligent in supervising the child**. 

There have been recent attempts at enacting legislative reforms to make parents exercise more care and control over their children. The *Manitoba Parental Responsibility Act* cited by Osborne (at Note 55) is similar to B.C.’s *Parental Liability Act*, which says that **parents are liable for the intentional torts of their children** (to a maximum of $10,000). However, the defences of reasonable supervision relate to intentional torts. Parental liability for negligent acts of their children follows the common-law rule.

**The Physically Disabled**

Unlike the mentally disabled, the physically disabled are judged according to **a modified standard of care**, **the standard of a reasonable person with a similar disability**. So for example, a blind person will be judged according to what a reasonable blind person would do in a similar situation. 

This does not necessarily imply a lower standard, for reasonable people with certain disabilities may actually take more care when engaged in certain activities than able-bodied people. Although there are obligations to take precautions to prevent “forseeable injuries” to the physically disabled that obligation does not extend beyond acts that are not foreseeable (see Note 58).

**Professionals and Those with Superior Skill and Knowledge in General**

The standard of care can also be **higher** than the usual reasonable person test, when the defendant is a **professional**, and the negligent act falls **within that person’s profession**. 

As described in the text, those who represent themselves as having superior skill and knowledge to the ordinary person, and are involved in certain professions, along with skilled tradespeople are held to a modified standard of care. It is the standard of a reasonable person with the same training, skills and knowledge that will then apply. This is, of course, a higher standard than is used for an “ordinary” person, but it only applies to alleged negligence in the course of the occupation in question (whether it be doctor, lawyer, architect, engineer, police officer, or other professional occupation).

**Doctors**

There are a number of cases involving **medical malpractice** suits. These can range from anything involving diagnosis, prescribing medication, office treatments, procedures, surgeries, etc. The standard of care in such cases is **what a reasonable physician with the same training, skills and knowledge would have done**. This standard is not the same for general doctors and specialists. For specialists, the standard of care is what a reasonable specialist with the same training, skills and knowledge would have done.

Some points relating to the **standard of care for medical professionals** include:

- The physician must have the skill, knowledge and judgement of the average physician (the usual rule for professionals).
- The “**average physician**” depends on the group to which this physician belongs: Is the doctor a specialist? Does the doctor work in a rural setting?
- If the physician’s conduct was consistent with what an average physician would have done, there would be **no liability even if the physician made an error** in judgement.

In medical cases, the standard of care is determined mainly by **custom**, that is, **established practices** in the field. 

**Expert evidence** is invariably required to prove what the custom was at the time of the incident in question. The courts do not have to accept the custom. But in medical malpractice cases if the doctor follows an established custom, the courts are unlikely to find liability.

It’s also important to point out that the **doctrine of informed consent to medical treatment** applies to medical professionals. This doctrine covers standard of care but also touches on duty of care and causation and we will examine it in Module 4.

**A Note on Lawyers**

Lawyers can be sued in negligence as well as in contract, as can doctors. When it comes to negligence actions, the Standard of Care expected of lawyers is the **modified standard of exercising the care, skill and knowledge of a reasonably prudent lawyer**. 

The lawyer must act in the client’s best interest, but in both solicitor work and litigation the strategy that the lawyer chooses is a matter of judgement. Generally, if a lawyer has acted reasonably, the lawyer will not be liable. It does not matter that an alternative method of handling the case could have been taken, the conduct of a case is left to a lawyer’s discretion.

These descriptions of the Standard of Care expected of lawyers are echoed in the Law Society of B.C.’s C*ode of Professional Conduct*, e.g., in chapter 2, on competence.

## Topic 3: Burden, Standard of Proof and Evidence

!!! info "*Fontaine v. British Columbia (Official Administrator)*, [1998 CanLII 814 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fqt1){:target=" \_blank"}, headnote"

    - At issue here was when ***res ipsa loquitur*** (the principle that the **occurrence of an accident implies negligence**) applies and the effect of invoking it.
    - Since various attempts to apply *res ipsa loquitur* have been more confusing than helpful, **the law is better served if the maxim is treated as expired and no longer a separate component in negligence actions**.   
    - The circumstantial evidence that the maxim attempted to deal with is more sensibly dealt with by the trier of fact, who should weigh the circumstantial evidence with the direct evidence, if any, to determine whether **the plaintiff has established on a balance of probabilities a *prima facie* case of negligence** against the defendant.  
    - The circumstantial evidence here did not discharge the plaintiff’s onus.  Many of the circumstances of the accident, including the date, time and precise location, were not known.  There were minimal, if any, evidentiary foundations from which any inference of negligence could be drawn. 

The plaintiff has the burden of proof of each element of negligence. However, there are some exceptions to this general rule.

**Onus of proof**

Typically the plaintiff will have to prove each of the elements of a negligence action. The plaintiff must lead evidence at trial on each of these issues, and the defendant can rebut with the defendant’s own evidence. By the end of the trial, the plaintiff must have proved each of the elements on **a balance of probabilities**. If the plaintiff is unable to do so, the claim will fail.

**Inferring negligence, and the former “doctrine” of *res ipsa loquitur***

Sometimes, a plaintiff is unable to prove on a balance of probabilities that the standard of care has been breached as there may not be any direct evidence of negligence. However, there may be circumstantial evidence pointing to negligence. 

Cases involving falling objects, explosions, aircraft crashes (in good weather), and fires (especially in places where fires don’t normally occur) are examples of cases in which it is difficult for a plaintiff to prove exactly what happened. However, plaintiffs can succeed in such cases if the court is willing to infer that the **accident would not have happened unless negligence was involved**, and that the person most likely to have committed the negligent act is the defendant.

Under the doctrine of ***res ipsa loquitur***, which is Latin for “**the thing speaks for itself**,” plaintiffs were able to satisfy the burden of proof based solely on circumstantial evidence.

For ***res ipsa loquitur*** to apply, three criteria had to be established:

- The “thing” that caused the damage had to be under the **sole management and control** of the defendant. Possession was not necessary, but management and control was.
- The occurrence must have been such that it **would not have occurred without negligence** and such that it points to negligence on the part of the defendant.
- There must have been **no direct evidence** as to why or how the occurrence took place.

Applying the doctrine had its share of difficulties. However, the courts do not have to concern themselves with those difficulties anymore, as the Supreme Court of Canada effectively **abolished** ***res ipsa loquitur*** in 1998 with its decision in ***Fontaine***.

In ***Fontaine***, the SCC rejected the doctrine and confirmed that the plaintiff still has the burden of proving her case on a balance of probabilities. 

## Textbook Summary: pp 27 - 54

**B. THE STANDARD OF CARE: THE REASONABLY CAREFUL PERSON**

The standard of the reasonably careful person was authoritatively established in the English case of ***Vaughan v Menlove***. At issue was the appropriate measure of the defendant’s conduct. Chief Justice held that the defendant must “adhere to the rule which requires in all cases a regard to caution such as a man [person] of ordinary prudence would observe.” The defendant was held liable. 

The standard of care of the reasonable person is an **objective** standard. It focuses on the defendant’s conduct and its sufficiency with reference to that of a reasonable person. The objective test excludes all of these individual characteristics in its determination of reasonable care. 

**(1) Application of the Standard of Care**

When applying the standard of care to the facts of a case, courts have found it useful to review **a number of factors** that guide a reasonable person in the regulation of her conduct.

***(a) Foreseeable Risk***

The concept of foreseeability may not, in itself, be sufficient to support a finding of negligence because other factors must be considered, but it is an essential component of liability. Four decisions of the Supreme Court illustrate the pivotal role of reasonable foreseeability. All four cases involved children who were injured when they came into contact with high-voltage electric wires under the control of the defendant power corporations. The defendant was found to be negligent in two of them. 

***(b) The Likelihood of Damage***

Consideration is to be given not only to the foreseeability of damage but also to the likelihood of it occurring. The reasonable person takes greater care where there is a strong likelihood of damage and takes lesser care when the chance of damage is minimal. 

The leading case on this point is ***Bolton v Stone***. The Court drew a distinction between foreseeable risks that are **substantial and material** and foreseeable risks that are **highly unlikely or mere possibilities**. Reasonable people avoid creating material and substantial risks of foreseeable harm. They cleanse their conduct of unreasonable risks, not every foreseeable risk. 

***(c) The Seriousness of the Threatened Harm***

The reasonable person also regulates his conduct with reference to the severity of the threatened harm. The leading case illustrating the need to take greater care when the threatened harm is serious is ***Paris v Stepney Borough Council***. 

While there may have been **no greater risk of injury** to the plaintiff, there was **a risk of greater injury** to him, and a reasonable employer would have taken greater care for an employee who had already lost his sight in one eye.

The severity of the threatened harm was also a factor in favour of the defendant in ***Bolton***. A cricket ball does not present a risk of serious injury or death. A laceration or a bruise is the most that one might anticipate. 

***(d) The Cost of Preventive Measures***

Consideration of the magnitude of the risk (the likelihood of the damage multiplied by the seriousness of the threatened harm) must be balanced by a consideration of the cost of the measures needed to reduce or neutralize the risk. It is neither good policy nor good sense to demand extravagantly expensive and impractical measures to remove minimal risks. 

On the other hand, where reasonable, affordable, and practical safety measures are available to combat foreseeable risks, they must normally be taken. 

The Supreme Court addressed this issue in ***Ware’s Taxi Ltd v Gilliham***.  A majority held that the defendant was negligent. The suggested pre-cautionary measures, including the use of the childproof locks, were inexpensive, feasible, and would not interfere unduly with the transportation of children to and from school. 

A useful contrast is provided by the House of Lords decision in ***Latimer v AEC Ltd***. The House of Lords held that the defendant was not negligent. On balance, the small risk to the employees was insufficient to justify the expense and inconvenience of completely interrupting the defendant’s business, even on a temporary basis.

***(e) The Utility of the Defendant’s Conduct***

The utility of the defendant’s conduct is also a relevant factor in the application of the standard of care. This factor, however, appears to be directly relevant to only a few cases. Those cases usually involve **governmental services** where the inevitable price of direct and necessary benefits to the public is an increased risk of injury to innocent persons. 

The utility of the defendant’s conduct also has a general, pervasive influence in all negligence cases. Judges are acutely aware that most defendants in negligence cases are, at the time of the accident, pursuing legitimate activities of personal, commercial, or public utility and that these activities inevitably carry some degree of risk. The task of the courts is to decide society’s current degree of risk tolerance by labelling risks as either reasonable (no liability) or unreasonable (liability). 

***(f) Emergency Situations***

Sometimes defendants must act in an imminent and unanticipated emergency that is not of their making. Courts are sympathetic to the defendant’s plight and some leniency is shown to defendants who have done their best in the “agony of the moment.” 

This leniency is particularly pronounced where the defendant is acting in the capacity of a rescuer. In ***Horsley v McLaren***, the Supreme Court considered the actions of the defendant owner of a pleasure boat when a passenger fell overboard and died in the frigid water. A majority of the Court held that the defendant may, in the heat of the moment, have made a mistake but he had acted in good faith and had done his best to rescue the deceased. He was not negligent. 

***(g) Custom and Approved Practice***

The application of the standard of care is also influenced by proof that the defendant’s behaviour was consistent with the established practices and customs of other citizens carrying out similar activities and tasks. 

It is not uncommon, for example, for a defendant who is a member of a business, trade, or profession to seek to avoid a finding of negligence on the grounds that she had acted in accordance with a well-established custom or practice of the group to which she belongs. There are good reasons for the court to consider such evidence. It establishes a concrete, defined course of conduct that reflects the accumulated wisdom of those involved in the activity. It indicates a course of conduct that has been found in the past to be acceptable and affordable. Furthermore, in situations where the courts have little expertise, evidence that crystallizes the abstract standard of the reasonable person into actual practices and procedures is of significant assistance. 

The more difficult question relates to the weight that should be given to the evidence that the defendant complied with established practice. Early in the twentieth century, courts treated compliance with approved practice as **conclusive of due care**. The current approach is to view proof of compliance with approved practice as providing **some evidence of due care**. 

Proof of compliance with approved practice is particularly influential in medical malpractice cases. Courts pay great deference to the practice and customs of the medical profession. The Supreme Court decision in ***ter Neuzen v Korn*** is illustrative. The Supreme Court held that “where a procedure involves difficult or uncertain questions of medical treatment or complex, scientific or highly technical matters that are beyond the ordinary experience and understanding of a judge or jury, it will not be open to find a standard medical practice negligent.” 

The Court also recognized, however, that, conversely, where a standard practice is fraught with obvious risks that any layperson could understand, a finding of negligence may be made. 

Approved practice and custom is also a relevant factor when the defendant is not in compliance with it. **A deviation from customary standards** is not conclusive of negligence but it is likely to be given significant weight by the court, and the defendant is wise to negate this evidence by giving some explanation for the deviation or by showing that her conduct was no more dangerous than the standard practice.

***(h) Post-accident Precautions***

Evidence of post-accident precautions may not, in itself, be construed as an admission of liability but it may be admitted to establish a fact that supports a finding of negligence where the evidence would not be unduly prejudicial to the defendant. 

This distinction, which is not an easy one to draw in practice, is illustrated by ***Anderson v Maple Ridge (District of)***. In that case the British Columbia Court of Appeal approved the use of evidence that a stop sign was moved by the defendant municipality after a car accident and that there was a subsequent reduction in accidents to show that the sign was difficult to see in its original location. This treatment of post-accident conduct may lack precision and certainty but it does allow the courts to deal with the issue sensitively and to promote one or other of the competing policies as the circumstances of the individual case warrant.

***(i) Judicial Policy*** 

There is a great deal of unevenness in the way the standard of care is applied to different activities. This unevenness, which is facilitated by the abstract and malleable nature of the reasonable person standard, is reflective of judicial policy. 

In respect of some activities, the courts have exercised their discretion to impose high standards of care approaching strict liability. In other cases, a more relaxed standard has been favoured. 

Judicial policy is rarely addressed openly in written judgments dealing with standard of care issues, but general patterns of liability are apparent and are increasingly identifiable through computer searches of judgments in various fields of activity. They may be useful, albeit imprecise, predictors of the manner in which the standard of care is applied.

***(j) Economic Analysis*** 

The courts have not openly embraced the concept but it is likely that economic theories developed and popularized in the United States influence some judicial thinking. 

Of particular relevance is the view that the dominant purpose of negligence law is not compensation but accident prevention. The standard of care should, therefore, be set to reflect the economically efficient level of accident prevention. **Consequently**, if the cost of precautionary measures is less than the likelihood of the injury multiplied by the magnitude of the loss, it is negligent to fail to take the precautionary measures. If, on the other hand, the cost of precautionary measures is more than the likelihood of the injury multiplied by the magnitude of the loss, it is not justi- fiable, economically, to take those measures, and the failure to take them is not negligent. 

***(k) The Equity of the Case*** 

Inevitably, other factors such as an intuitive sense of fairness and a visceral response to the facts of the case exert some degree of influence. Consciously or unconsciously, facts may be emphasized or marginalized and principles may be interpreted broadly or narrowly to **accommodate the demands of justice** in a particular case. 

The extent to which the equity of the case influences decision making depends in large part on individual judges and juries but it is a factor that should not be ignored. 

***(l) Hindsight Bias*** 

Psychological studies have shown that people “overstate the predictability of past events” and consistently overestimate what could have been foreseen before an event occurred. This is known as **hindsight bias**. 

There are some rules of negligence law which seek to minimize the risk of hindsight bias in applying the standard of care. The use of approved practice and custom in setting the standard of care is a moderating influence, and the trier of fact must not treat post-accident precautions as an admission of liability. 

Nevertheless, an elusive concept such as reasonable foreseeability, which is so integral to the determination of negligence liability, is highly susceptible to hindsight bias and may lead to a *de facto* strict liability in some borderline cases.

**(2) Special Standards of Care**

There are certain situations where the standard of the reasonably careful person is not applied to the defendant. This may have the effect of either **lowering** or **elevating** the standard of care. 

***(a) Mental Disability*** 

Considerations of fairness and justice suggest that mentally incapacitated defendants should be free of liability. It does not seem right to punish or deter those who are incapable of acting with reasonable care. Compensation and loss distribution policies, however, favour the application of the objective standard of reasonable care and the imposition of liability. 

Canadian law has traditionally resolved this conflict in favour of mentally impaired defendants. The issue of a defendant’s mental disability operates on two levels in negligence cases. It may render the defendant’s actions involuntary or it may prevent a volitional defendant from complying with the normative standard of care. In both situations, there is no liability in negligence. 

The landmark case dealing with the impact of mental disability on the application of the standard of care to volitional defendants is the Ontario Court of Appeal decision in ***Buckley v Smith Transport Ltd***. In 1999 the Alberta Court of Appeal followed ***Buckley***. In ***Fiala v Cechmanek*** the defendant, who was suffering from a severe manic episode, violently attacked the driver of a car stopped at an intersection. The court characterized **tort law as a system of corrective justice that should not be distorted by a robust pursuit of compensatory goals**. The defendant was robbed of his capacity to understand or appreciate his duty of care by the sudden onset of a serious mental illness and he could **not be found liable** in negligence.

***(b) Children*** 

Children do not have the same knowledge, experience, or wisdom as adults to foresee danger and act accordingly. Mental capacity and the ability to perceive risk develop gradually at a child’s own pace. The courts have been sensitive to the diminished capacity of children to take care and have developed a special standard of care applicable to them. 

Canadian courts have rejected both of these approaches and have adopted a mixed objective/subjective test of liabilty. In ***McEllistrum v Etches***, the Supreme Court held that the standard of care applicable to a child was **that of a child of similar age, intelligence, and experience** as the defendant. The latter two elements are clearly subjective and a careful evaluation of the child and the circumstances surrounding her conduct is required. 

The great majority of cases involving children deal with the **contributory negligence** of child plaintiffs. There is less litigation against child defendants. 

When children are performing adult activities, such as driving a power boat, a Sea-Doo, a dirt bike, or an all-terrain vehicle, members of the public reasonably expect it to be under the control of an adult and they adjust their conduct accordingly. The courts protect that reasonable expectation by applying the **standard of the reasonably careful adult**. 

Parents are not vicariously liable for the torts of their children. But they are under **a personal duty to take reasonable care to supervise and control** their minor children and they may be liable for loss caused by a failure to discharge that obligation. 

There is, however, renewed interest in the idea of vicarious liability of parents. The *Manitoba Parental Responsibility Act*, for example, imposes civil liability on parents for the intentional destruction, damage, or taking of property by their children up to a maximum sum of $10,000. 

***(c) Physical Disability*** 

The law accommodates those persons who suffer from a serious physical disability with **a standard of care that is compatible with their condition**. 

Public safety is not unduly compromised because there is a corresponding obligation on the part of disabled or ill persons to adjust their conduct so that no avoidable risk is created and to refrain from activities that are beyond their capacity to perform safely. 

This adjustment of the standard of care appears to be applicable only to major physical disabilities. No dispensation from the usual standard of care is provided to persons who are short-sighted, poorly coordinated, slow, elderly, or arthritic. 

***(d) Superior Skill and Knowledge*** 

Nevertheless, it is not always easy to determine the normative information and skill that should be attributed to the reasonable person. In ***Cone v Welock***, for example, the defendant guest at a hunting lodge felt and smelled fuel before using it to start a fire in his room. He mistook gasoline for fuel oil and the lodge was damaged by fire. The Supreme Court held that a reasonable person cannot readily distinguish fuel oil from gasoline and that reasonable care had been taken by the defendant. 

A higher standard of care is applied to those persons who represent themselves as having special skill and knowledge that allow them to perform tasks that are normally beyond the capacity of the ordinary person. The public may reasonably expect such people to exercise a degree of skill and knowledge commensurate with that representation. 

The standard of care is that of the reasonably prudent and competent member of the particular profession or vocation to which the defendant belongs. Many of the rules relating to professional liability have arisen from **malpractice** litigation between physicians and their patients. 

Circumstances may vary greatly but the care, skill, and knowledge of family physicians should be the same. The public’s expectation of competent medical care from all qualified persons must be protected. 

Error of judgment, misadventure, and the failure of treatment are not inconsistent with due care. It is, nevertheless, often difficult for a judge or jury to determine whether or not reasonable care was taken by a physician. Consequently, considerable reliance is placed on expert witnesses (highly qualified and experienced physicians who have no involvement in the litigation) to assist the trier of fact in understanding technical matters and in identifying the accepted and approved practice of the profession. As was noted earlier, **compliance with standard medical practice** in complex, scientific, and technical matters is **conclusive of due care** in medical cases. 

**(3) Proof of Negligence: Direct and Circumstantial Evidence** 

The burden of proof is on the plaintiff to establish on the balance of probabilities that the defendant was negligent. There may be direct evidence of negligence, as when a number of witnesses observe the failure of the defendant to stop at a red light. Sometimes, however, there is no direct evidence of how the accident occurred. In those cases, the plaintiff must rely on circumstantial evidence. 

Circumstantial evidence may support an inference or conclusion that the defendant was negligent. The use of circumstantial evidence with respect of the breach of the standard of care was, traditionally, controlled by the Latin maxim *res ipsa loquitur* (the thing speaks for itself). 

In 1998, however, the Supreme Court declared in ***Fontaine v British Columbia (Official Administrator)*** that this Latin maxim had outgrown its usefulness and should no longer be used in negligence cases. The Court did not, however, disagree with the general process of proving negligence by circumstantial evidence 

The Court held that the trier of fact must simply **weigh the circumstantial evidence with any available direct evidence and determine if the plaintiff has established a *prima facie* case of negligence**. Once the plaintiff has done this, the defendant must present evidence negating the inference of negligence or the plaintiff will win.

You may want to compare earlier cases with more recent decisions to see how the basic principles of Standard of Care have evolved with time (some suggested cases are below for the discussion, but you can comment on any of this week's case readings):
