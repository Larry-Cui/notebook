## Topic 1: Negligence Elements

The word negligence can have at least two legal meanings. 

- **Broad meaning:** an area of tort law dealing with **negligence liability**. It refers to the entire cause of action or claim, including all its constituent elements. So you might say: “The plaintiff sued the defendant in negligence.”
- **Narrow meaning:** one element in the claim, **the standard of care**. It refers to behaviour that has fallen below the standard of care, i.e., careless behaviour. So: “The defendant was negligent by not taking reasonable care, and injured the plaintiff.”

**The Negligence Cause of Action (Broad meaning)**

When we consider the negligence cause of action, various elements must be proved. 

- **Duty of care:** Does person A have a legal duty, or obligation, to take care towards person B? Not all relationships give rise to a duty of care. This is a question of law to be decided by the judge.
- **The standard of care and its breach:** Has A acted in a manner below the standard of care? There are actually two questions here: 
    - (1) What is the appropriate standard in this case? 
    - (2) Did the defendant fail to live up to that standard? 

    On the first question, the test for the standard in any given situation is the “**reasonable person test**”: what would a reasonable person do in this situation? This is **a question of law**. It turns on the general type of activity the defendant was engaged in, or the general type of defendant this is (e.g., a professional with skill or a regular person?). 
    
    The second question focuses on the facts of the **defendant’s conduct** in this particular case: If A acted below the relevant standard of care, we say A was negligent (narrow meaning). It is a “**question of fact**” whether A acted below the standard of care (as opposed to a “question of law”). 

- **Causation:** Did A’s negligence actually cause B’s loss? Even if conduct falls below the standard of care, that does not mean that it is the cause of B’s loss. This is a factual issue, and the main test is the “**but for test**,” as in: “But for the defendant’s conduct [i.e., if it had not happened], would the loss have occurred?” The answer is often speculative and hard to determine, after the fact (hindsight may be 20/20, but it is not perfect). 
- **Remoteness of damages:** Was B’s loss **reasonably foreseeable** by A? In other words, if A thought about it, could A have reasonably foreseen that A’s conduct would result in B’s loss? There must be some connection between A’s conduct and B’s loss that is within reason. Another way of saying this is: A’s conduct must be a proximate cause of B’s loss. **If the loss was not foreseeable, it would be too “remote,” and A would not be liable.** 
- **Actual loss:** Some torts do not require proof of loss (e.g. defamation, which we will study later in the course) but negligence does. B must prove **recognizable damage or loss**. 

The plaintiff (person B in the summaries above), a.k.a. the party who is suing, has the responsibility or burden of proving each of these five elements. **The plaintiff must satisfy the judge or jury that all of these elements exist in this case**. 

The distinction between **questions of law, questions of fact, and questions of mixed law and fact** were summarized in ***Canada (Director of Investigation and Research) v. Southam Inc.***, [1997 CanLII 385 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1fr34){:target=" \_blank"}, where **Iacobucci J.** stated for the court at para 35:

> Briefly stated, questions of law are questions about what the correct **legal test** is; questions of fact are questions about what actually took place between the parties; and questions of mixed law and fact are questions about whether the **facts satisfy the legal tests**.

!!! danger "Module 2 - Topic 1: Practice Question"

    1. An obligation to take care in one's actions towards another person is:
        - [x] duty of care
        - [ ] standard of care
        - [ ] causation
        - [ ] broad meaning of negligence

## Topic 2: Introduction to Duty of Care

A **duty of care** is a legal obligation by one party to take reasonable care to see that the party’s conduct does not harm another. It may be helpful now that you begin to think of **the elements of negligence as a series of hurdles the plaintiff must jump over**. Duty of care is a purely legal hurdle: there are some persons a plaintiff cannot sue, because those persons don’t owe the plaintiff a duty of care.
