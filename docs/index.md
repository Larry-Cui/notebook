After tons of trial and error, I finally pick this python based theme - [Material for Mkdocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material){:target="_blank"} as my personal static website template.

I'm writing all articles/posts from scratch, not aiming to appeal any readers, but as a way to take notes of my ideas, my feeling and my mood. 

If you happen to come across this site, I hope you find it useful, or maybe have some reverberation with your heart somewhere inside. 

But if you don't like it? Okay, I don't care, as this site is my personal playground, it's not supposed to be for anyone else, including you. 

In case I don't see ya, good afternoon, good evening, and good night!

Larry
