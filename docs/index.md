This website is a notebook.

From a legal assistant perspective, I will write down the notes I'm taking from time to time during my work. 

I don't think there's a high technical barrier between foreign lawyers and the legal practice in Canada, but it takes time to learn all bits of knowledge here and there in this new country and new legal system. 

In my experience, I'm keeping asking questions with my colleagues, which really helps me a lot. But the disadvantage is also very obvious: it's a old school way of learning with low efficiency. 

By taking notes, I'm trying to reduce the need to ask the same questions more than once, and by putting them online for sharing, I hope on this site, new comers can find most answers to the questions they are going to encounter in their work, saving both a lot of time and becoming handy faster.
