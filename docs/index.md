On 15 May 2025, I began my first job in Canada. 

Zero Canada work experience as I have, and knowing little about my skills, a local law firm in Calgary is brave enough hire me. They are either desperate in need of people working for them, or blindly confident about their judgement on candidates for the job, or both, I guess. 

That being said, people in this firm are really nice. A lot of people in the firm sacrifice their working time to teach me on every bits of details at work. I can tell they really want me to pick up the work soon, so they can trust me with more important work. 

That's a strange feeling: you know you may work for a firm for quite a long time, but people there treat you from the first day of the work as if they know you will stay there forever, is quite different. 

So I guess, maybe I need to be more serious about this job, and behave like a professional as people here see me. 

Yup, here I am. Taking notes is the only way I can think of to efficiently and effectively collect every bit of knowledge I come across at work.  

But putting notes online? Basically it's a kind of showcase, but it does come with some side effects:

- It prompts me to take notes more often;
- It offers me an easy access to the notes for review.
