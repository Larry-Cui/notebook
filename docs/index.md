On 15 May 2025, I began my first job in Canada. 

I feel lucky that a local law firm in Calgary is willing to hire me, although I'm completely ignorant of Canana laws, nor do I have any previous work experience in Canada. Yes, I did study law in Toronto for one year, but that's more than 20 years ago, and to be honest, I was not a good student. I spent more time at playing rather than studying back then. 

Old and ignorant as I am, people in this firm are tirelessly teaching me on every bits of details at work. I can tell they really want me to work here for a long term, and want me to gain new skills and become better.

There's no reason for me avoid learning and working hard to meet their expectation. 

So I guess, I need to learn fast and solid. The best way is to take notes along the way at work, and putting notes online comes with two fold purpose:

- It makes me feel obliged to study and summarize notes during work;
- It's helping me review notes and strenghen memory by easy access from anywhere, any devices.
