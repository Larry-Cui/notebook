It's just passed 12am at midnight to turn to the first day of June, 2023. 

Starting from 15 May 2025, I've been working at `Jade Sunrise Law` (previously called `Jade Summit Law`) for half month, and received my first salary in Canada. 

C$2,240 may not be a lot of money, but it means a lot to me. At least it proves two things:

 - My new boss in Canada sees my determination and recognizes my contribution, and treats me as the rest of the team.
 - It seems possible that I can live on my own here, no more or less dependent on the financial support from family back at home.
