On 15 May 2025, I began my first job in Canada. Unlike many people who have to start from some blue collar work, I'm fortunate to have an agent that happens to have a connection with a local law firm, and they recommended me to that firm. 

So here I am. I don't need to cut meat at a factory in remote rural area, grow vetetables in a farm, or raise cows and horses in a ranch. 

Instead, I can stay in the same line of work, "legal practice". Low level work as it is, it's the best spot for me to build up work experience in this area.

Canadian laws, law society rules and regulations, legal practice guidances, all these stuff are new to me. Starting from the first day at work, I've been overwhelmed by tons of new information and knowledge. So I think, I need to take notes along my work since day one. 

It'll be a great way to help me understand and get familiar with the laws and workflows, and it also functions as a documentary to record my growth from the very beginning.
