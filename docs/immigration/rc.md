Now you've got your PR, and you want to move one step forward: apply for the Canadian Citizenship. The most important question you should ask yourself before submitting your application: do I satisfy the residency obligation?

You should visit this website for detailed information.

## Residency Requirement Before You Apply for Citizenship

Simply put, the requirement is:

For applications received on or after October 11, 2017, under paragraph 5(1)(c)(i) of the Act, the applicant must have accumulated at least `1095` days of physical presence in Canada **within the five years immediately preceding** the date the applicant signed the application.

## Counting Rules

Among all rules, the following three should be kept in mind:

- [x] Each day of physical presence in Canada as a permanent resident counts as one day.
- [x] Each day of physical presence in Canada as an authorized temporary resident before becoming a permanent resident, counts as one half day, with a maximum of 365 days credit towards physical presence.
- [x] Time spent serving a sentence and absences must be subtracted from the total number of days of physical presence during the five-year period.
