??? note "Module 6 Knowledge Check"

    1. Gina is in the process of sponsoring her mother as a member of the Family Class. Her application, however, was refused as she was unable to show that she could meet the financial obligations of a sponsor. In a hearing before the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD), Gina would like to put forward proof that she can now meet the financial obligations due to a substantial raise she received at work, after the sponsorship application was submitted.

        The IAD should consider this proof of earnings and factor it into their decision.

        - [x] True
        - [ ] False
        > Appellants may submit new evidence of income relating to the period preceding the date of filing of their sponsorship application with respect to the legal validity of the decision. Evidence of a sponsor now being able to meet their financial obligations cannot change the legal validity of the officer's decision.
        >
        > However, proof of earnings and an ability to meet the financial requirements at the time of appeal, can be considered in the context of humanitarian and compassionate grounds. In fact, if the sponsor is able to show that they would now meet the financial requirements for a sponsorship, **the threshold for humanitarian and compassionate considerations is lowered**. See: *Jugpall v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)* (1999), 2 Imm.L.R. (3d) 222 (I.A.D.)

        - [ ] Reasons why the IAD should make the decision.
        - [ ] Evidence that the applicant wants the IAD to consider when it renders its decision.

    7. Tomas, a transgendered person, successfully received refugee protection in Canada in 2005. They are now a citizen of Canada and are looking to sponsor their mother to come to Canada. She still lives in Tomas' home country. Unfortunately, Tomas' sponsorship application was refused as their mother is inadmissible due to a medical condition.

        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        > **The IAD has the authority to reverse a valid decision on humanitarian and compassionate grounds when there is no concern that the sponsor is a sponsor and the applicant a member of the Family Class.** In the case at hand, though Tomas' mother is inadmissible the decision may be reversed given that Tomas cannot return to their home country due to a fear of persecution. This separation may amount to hardship and be a ground for appeal. (SOGIE Guidelines, 10.3)

        - [x] In a removal order appeal, whether a person with diverse SOGIE would have to conceal their identity to avoid harm, should be taken into consideration.

    13. Maria is looking to sponsor her adopted daughter, Sara, to come to Canada. Her daughter is living in her home country where girls are at particular risk of violence, and Maria would like to see her daughter come to Canada quickly. Maria's sponsorship application was initially refused, in part, because there was insufficient evidence to show that the adoption of Maria's daughter is legal for immigration purposes.
