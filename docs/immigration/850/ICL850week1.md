??? note "Reading M v H"

    - *M v H*, [[1999] 2 SCR 3](https://canlii.ca/t/1fqm4){:target="\_blank"}.
    - In May 1999, the Supreme Court ruled in *M v H* that Ontario’s Family Law Act violated the Charter by excluding same-sex couples and ordered the Ontario government to change the law. The *M v H* case and a growing number of Charter victories by gays and lesbians resulted in **a wave of legislation across Canada to recognize same-sex relationships** in common law.
    - In paragraphs 59 and 60, Justices Cory and Iacobacci, writing for the majority, refer to the case of *Molodowich v Penttinen*, [1980 CanLII 1537, 17 RFL (2d) 376 (Ont Dist Ct)](https://canlii.ca/t/fqnbv){:target="\_blank"}. They list the factors discussed in that case and add some comments regarding the necessity of a flexible approach to the application of these factors. Note that the *Molodowich* case is quite old and from a fairly low level of court. But by citing these factors and implicitly approving of them, the Supreme Court essentially enshrined them as **the test for conjugal relationships**, at least in the context of family law.
        - Molodowich v. Penttinen (1980), 1980 CanLII 1537 (ON SC), 17 R.F.L. (2d) 376 (Ont. Dist. Ct.), sets out the generally accepted characteristics of a conjugal relationship.
        - They include **shared shelter**, **sexual and personal behaviour**, **services**, **social activities**, **economic support** and **children**, as well as the **societal perception of the couple**.
        - However, it was recognized that these elements may be present in varying degrees and **not all are necessary** for the relationship to be found to be conjugal.  While it is true that there may not be any consensus as to the societal perception of same‑sex couples, there is agreement that same‑sex couples share many other “conjugal” characteristics.
        - In order to come within the definition, neither opposite‑sex couples nor same‑sex couples are required to fit precisely the traditional marital model to demonstrate that the relationship is “conjugal”.
    - The importation of these factors into immigration law occurred later. It is interesting to note that *Molodowich* is only mentioned once in the entire SCC judgement, but it has had a substantial impact on how one might argue whether their client is in a conjugal relationship. These factors are referred to in many other cases, including in the *Clouthier* decision, which is in your readings list, at paragraph [13](https://canlii.ca/t/fqkxz){:target="\_blank"}.
        - Genuineness may be assessed by reviewing a number of factors such as mutual commitment to a shared life to the exclusion of all other conjugal relationships and physical, emotional, financial and social interdependence. In *M. v H.*, the Supreme Court of Canada adopts the seven characteristics of a conjugal relationship as set out in *Molodowich*:
            1. **Shelter** - Whether the partners live together in the same home as a couple;
            2. **Sexual and personal behaviour** - Whether the partners’ relationship is exclusive, committed and evidenced by emotional, intellectual and physical interaction;
            3. **Services** - Whether household and other family-type responsibilities are shared and whether there is evidence of mutual assistance especially in time of need;
            4. **Social activities** - Whether the partners share time together or participate in leisure activity together - Whether they have relationships or interaction with each other’s respective family;
            5. **Economic support** - Whether the partners are financially interdependent or dependent - Whether the partners have joined, to some extent, their financial affairs (for example, as in joint-ownership of assets or arranged them to reflect their ongoing relationship) (for example, naming the other partner beneficiary in an insurance policy or will);
            6. **Children** - The partners’ attitude and conduct towards children in the context of their relationship; and,
            7. **Special perception** - Whether the partners are treated or perceived by the community as a couple.

???+ note "Exclusion and Inclusion of LGBTQ+ Families _by_ Michael Battista"

    - Question: When were LGBTQ+ families recognized under IRPA to permit sponsorship?
        - MB: LGBTQ families were first allowed into the family class sponsorship regime with the promulgation of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act in **2002**.
    - Question: What impact did the *M v H* case have on sponsorships under Canadian immigration law?
        - MB: The impact of the M v H case on immigration sponsorships was and is profound. Using M v H, immigration policymakers have taken the principles defining a conjugal relationship for the purpose of family law and applied them to immigration law. This has led to a flexible and realistic approach to determining a genuine spousal or partner relationship which looks beyond a marriage certificate or proof of cohabitation. Often, a marriage certificate or proof of cohabitation are not realistic expectations in the immigration context.
    - Question: What did LGBTQ+ families do before IRPA was amended to include LGBTQ+ relationships? 
        - MB: Prior to IRPA, LGBTQ+ families could not be sponsored by their same-sex Canadian partners because they did not meet the definition of "spouse" in the 1976 Immigration Act.
    - Question: Is the current definition of a spouse inclusive of LGBTQ+ relationships? What needs to be changed?
        - Same-sex couples are likely more dependent on the conjugal partner relationship category because there are fewer places in the world where they can legally marry, and cohabitation is unrealistic in the immigration context. Yet the conjugal partner relationship category involves **more evidence and less guidance** in adjudicating what is sufficient proof of a relationship.
    - Question: How are LGBTQ+ sponsorships unique in the practice sense of preparing the application or preparing for an IAD sponsorship appeal?
        - MB: Parties in LGBTQ+ relationships are usually concerned with stigma and shame, and they may fear being judged for their orientation and/or choices, or misunderstood. **They may not be forthcoming with details regarding the reality and complexity of their lives and decisions.**
