    - Appeals at IAD share common features:
        - Appeal Hearings are considered *de novo*.
        - The Appellant has the onus of proof.
        - Documentation must be served on the Minister’s counsel and filed with the IAD at least **20 days** before the date set for the hearing.
        - Strict rules of evidence do not apply to IAD hearings.
        - The names and contact details of **witnesses** must be provided at least 20 days before the hearing.
        - Testimony can take place over the phone, including from other countries.
        - The IAD supplies an interpreter for the hearing, if required.
        - The witnesses must remain outside the hearing room when the Appellant gives testimony and cannot speak with one another about their testimonies until and unless they have each testified.
        - The principle of ***res judicata*** applies to decisions of the IAD. If you lose, your only recourse is to recommend that the client retain a lawyer to commence judicial review proceedings in Federal Court.
        - Prepare your witnesses for testimony!
        - Your submissions should be directed to and deal with, the **weakest part** of your case.
    - As the appeal hearing is *de novo*, the appellant must be allowed to introduce evidence of such a nature.
    - At the end of the testimony of the appellant and his spouse the last question to each should be; “**If you lose the appeal, what will you do?**” Hopefully that answer will be; “live together, anywhere we can.”
    - Other sponsorship appeals may include parental sponsorships, where the issue is whether the **minimum necessary income (MNI) level is met** for the sponsor. **Admissibility** issues, such as where the person being sponsored has a criminal record or medical issue or has been on welfare and so is inadmissible to Canada. In these types of cases, the issue will be whether sufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds exist to over come the inadmissibility or the income deficiency. If the inadmissibility is overcome at the time of the appeal hearing, **a lower standard of H & C requirements is necessary to win**.
