    - Appeals at IAD share common features:
        - Appeal Hearings are considered *de novo*.
        - The Appellant has the onus of proof.
        - Documentation must be served on the Minister’s counsel and filed with the IAD at least **20 days** before the date set for the hearing.
        - Strict rules of evidence do not apply to IAD hearings.
        - The names and contact details of **witnesses** must be provided at least 20 days before the hearing.
        - Testimony can take place over the phone, including from other countries.
        - The IAD supplies an interpreter for the hearing, if required.
        - The witnesses must remain outside the hearing room when the Appellant gives testimony and cannot speak with one another about their testimonies until and unless they have each testified.
        - The principle of ***res judicata*** applies to decisions of the IAD. If you lose, your only recourse is to recommend that the client retain a lawyer to commence judicial review proceedings in Federal Court.
        - Prepare your witnesses for testimony!
        - Your submissions should be directed to and deal with, the **weakest part** of your case.
    - As the appeal hearing is *de novo*, the appellant must be allowed to introduce evidence of such a nature.
    - At the end of the testimony of the appellant and his spouse the last question to each should be; “**If you lose the appeal, what will you do?**” Hopefully that answer will be; “live together, anywhere we can.”
    - Other sponsorship appeals may include parental sponsorships, where the issue is whether the **minimum necessary income (MNI) level is met** for the sponsor. **Admissibility** issues, such as where the person being sponsored has a criminal record or medical issue or has been on welfare and so is inadmissible to Canada. In these types of cases, the issue will be whether sufficient humanitarian and compassionate grounds exist to over come the inadmissibility or the income deficiency. If the inadmissibility is overcome at the time of the appeal hearing, **a lower standard of H & C requirements is necessary to win**.

## Quizzes

??? note "Module 5 Knowledge Check"

    1. Sanji is a visa officer who is assessing a request for reconsideration of a grandparent sponsorship application. What factors may Sanji take into consideration when assessing this request?  (Select all that apply.)

        - [x] Whether any concerns over fraud or misrepresentation have been raised.
        - [x] Whether the principles of procedural fairness were not complied with in rendering the original decision.

        > IRCC sets out a **non-exhaustive list of possible factors** that may be taken into consideration during a reconsideration, which includes all the above factors.

    2. You have been hired to represent your client in an appeal of their refused sponsorship application before the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD). A notice of appeal has already been delivered, and you are waiting for a copy of the appeal record from the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). What must the appeal record contain? Select all that apply.
        - [x] Your client's application for sponsorship and the sponsor's undertaking.
        - [x] Any documents the CBSA has that are relevant to an issue in your client's appeal.

        > Section 20(1) of the IAD Rules

    3. Eli's application for permanent residence was refused. It was determined that he was not in a genuine relationship with his sponsor, Sumaya.

        This was the only reason given in the reasons for refusal.

        In an appeal before the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD), the IAD found that sufficient evidence was submitted to demonstrate a genuine relationship; however, the application was refused as there were new concerns regarding Sumaya's ability to meet the financial obligations of a sponsor.

        Was the IAD permitted, in this circumstance, to refuse the application?
        - [ ] No, the IAD can only consider issues in the original reasons for refusal.
        - [ ] No, the IAD must send the application back to the Immigration Division for reconsideration regarding issues not in the original reasons for refusal.
        - [x] Yes, the IAD can consider issues that were not in the original reasons for refusal.
        - [ ] Both (a) and (b)
        > Because a sponsorship appeal presented to the IAD constitutes hearing *de novo*, the IAD must hear the whole case and can consider any additional facts and evidence brought to its attention. The IAD can therefore consider issues in the appeal that were not before the immigration officer in the original decision. *Kahlon v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)*, [2007 CanLII 67504 (CA IRB)](https://canlii.ca/t/1zg1v){:target="\_blank"}

    4. Clarence is the sponsor in a refused permanent residence application for his spouse.

    5. In the process of sponsoring her common-law partner for permanent residence, Liz was given a procedural fairness letter from the Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) to address inconsistencies in the application regarding her partner's education.

        After responding to the procedural fairness letter, the application was refused. The reasons for the refusal noted that there were concerns about Liz' ability to meet the requirements of a sponsor.

        In responding to the procedural fairness letter, Liz should have updated the IRCC on her ability to meet the requirements of a sponsor so that her application would not have been refused.

        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        > I**n responding to a procedural fairness letter, the applicant only needs to address the issues and concerns raised by the immigration officer in the letter.**
        > As detailed in *Jin v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2014 FC 612](https://canlii.ca/t/g7n7x){:target="\_blank"}, an applicant can only be expected to respond to issues which are raised to them, and the failure to raise the concerns may be a breach of procedural fairness.

    9. Jael tried to sponsor her husband, Carlo, and his two daughters (ages 17 and 6) for permanent residence to Canada. The sponsorship application was refused. In an appeal before the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD), an application for humanitarian and compassionate consideration was submitted based on the best interests of the children.

        Because of the age of Carlo's youngest daughter, Jael's counsel would like to request that Carlo's oldest daughter be her designated representative at the IAD hearing. Will this request be granted?

        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        > While the Supreme Court in Vavilov set out that the presumptive standard of review is reasonableness, this is not the case **for questions of law where the standard of review is correctness**. Accordingly, the Federal Court will need to ask if the officer correctly applied the right legal test.

    14. Natalia is sponsoring her adopted daughter to come to Canada. In assessing her application, the visa office is concerned that there is insufficient evidence to show that there is a genuine parent-child relationship.

        What step will the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) generally first take when they are not satisfied with the documents submitted for an application?
        - [ ] Refuse the application.
        - [ ] Send the application to a senior officer for a second look at the application.

Ji-Min has made an application to sponsor his parents for permanent residence with Dae-jung as a co-signer. The application, however, was refused for misrepresentation. Ji-Min would like to challenge the decision before the Immigration Appeal Division. Will he be permitted to do so?

        - [ ] No, there are certain exceptions for when the IAD will hear appeals for misrepresentation, but Ji-Min does not fall into those categories.
        > According to section **64(3) of IRPA**, no appeals may be made before the IAD based on a finding of **inadmissibility on the ground of misrepresentation unless the foreign national is the sponsor's spouse, common-law partner, or child**.
