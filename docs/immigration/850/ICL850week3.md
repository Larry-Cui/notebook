??? note "Tutorial notes"

    - Sunday 9:00am.
    - The following activities will anchor important discussions in Tutorial 3:
        - Mock Sponsorship Application (Activity)
        - Case Study 2: Evidence and the admissibility of evidence
    - spouse sponsorship - in Canada vs Overseas:
        - in Canada:
            - must remain in Canada until a decision is made
            - cannot exit Canada, a few days would be allowed but the onus is on the applicant to prove they are re-entering Canada on a dual purpose.
            - eligible for work permit
            - cannot appeal to the IAD
            - difficulty overcoming inadmissibility (not so much)
        - Overseas application:
            - right to appeal to IAD
            - faster processing time
            - only option for conjugal partners.
    - evidence accepted for assessment:
        - marriage certificate
        - statutory declaration
        - birth certificate
        - financial interdependence
        - cohabitation history
        - wedding photos
    - Officer's subjectivity
        - calls for objectivity and cultural competence
        - decision maker's pre-conceived notions
        - potential for negative outcomes

## Quizzes

??? note "Module 3 Knowledge Check"

    1. What factor is not listed in Liu v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) for determining the genuineness of a marriage?
        - [x] The parties' cultural understanding of marriage.
        - [ ] Levels of continuing contact and communication.
        - [ ] Knowledge of and contact with extended families of the parties.
        - [ ] the conduct of the parties at the time of meeting, engagement and/or the wedding

    2. In the secondary processing stage of a Family Class sponsorship application, an admissibility assessment of the applicant on health grounds is completed unless the applicant is: (Select all that apply.)
        - [x] a dependent child of the sponsor.
        - [x] a spouse, common-law, or conjugal partner of the sponsor.
        - [ ] a parent of the sponsor.
        - [ ] a grandparent of the sponsor.
        > The admissibility assessment on health grounds does not apply to applicants applying on the basis of spouse, common-law, and conjugal partner and dependent child relationships. Such applicants cannot be refused permanent reunification with their sponsor due to health concerns.
        > Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, SC 2001, c.27, s. 38(2)(a).

    3. When an officer is assessing the timing of a marriage to determine genuineness:
        - [ ] a marriage occurring under three months after the applicant and sponsor have met should be treated with suspicion.
        - [ ] a marriage occurring under six months after the applicant and sponsor have met should be treated with suspicion.
        - [ ] a marriage occurring under one year after the applicant and sponsor have met should be treated with suspicion.
        - [x] there is no benchmark to determine whether a marriage happened at an appropriate time.
        > The Federal Court in *Zhou v Canada* states, "While the speed with which a relationship develops can be a relevant consideration, it must be approached with care. Affairs of the heart seldom unfold fully rationally. **There is no objective benchmark** by which to determine whether a given relationship developed at the appropriate speed or not."

    4. Chris and Jamie have been in a relationship for two years. They have lived together in Canada for the past 18 months. Chris is a Canadian citizen. He would like to sponsor Jamie under the Spouse or Common-Law Partner in Canada Class. Jamie has no status in Canada. Public policy will allow Chris to sponsor Jamie on humanitarian and compassionate grounds unless Jamie's lack of status is because she:
        - [ ] overstayed her temporary resident permit.
        - [x] entered Canada through misrepresentation.
        - [ ] worked or studied without proper authorization.
        - [ ] overstayed her study permit.
        > IRCC's "**Public Policy Under A25(1) of IRPA to Facilitate Processing in accordance with the Regulations of the Spouse or Common-law Partner in Canada Class**" reduces barriers for spouses and partners who lack status. However, this does not extend to applicants who:
        > entered Canada through misrepresentation or
        > failed to obtain a required authorization to return to Canada after removal.

    5. The collection of biometrics (biographical information, fingerprints, and photographs), at the secondary processing stage of a sponsorship application, is used to: (Select all that apply.)
        - [x] prevent identity fraud.
        - [x] efficiently determine a prospective immigrant's criminality.
        - [x] efficiently determine a prospective immigrant's immigration history.
        - [x] facilitate the sharing of personal information with immigration authorities.

    6. Taylor sponsored Avery for permanent residence as her common-law partner. Taylor and Avery were in a common-law relationship for eighteen months. However,  at the time Avery arrived in Canada, the relationship broke down. While Avery was making efforts to reconcile the relationship, Taylor was showing no efforts and no longer wanted to live with Avery. Should Avery report the breakdown of this relationship to the IRCC?
        - [ ] No. Because Avery has already arrived in Canada, they have no duty to report the relationship breakdown to the IRCC.
        - [ ] No. Because Avery was still making efforts to reconcile the relationship, there was no need to report the relationship breakdown to the IRCC.
        - [ ] No. Given that Taylor and Avery had met the one-year cohabitation requirement, they have no duty to report the relationship breakdown to the IRCC.
        - [x] Yes. Not disclosing Taylor's lack of effort in reconciliation and the fact that they no longer want to live with Avery may amount to misrepresentation.
        > The Federal Court in *Brar v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)* 2016 FC 542 notes that **reporting a relationship breakdown** is part of an applicant's duty of candour to provide "complete, honest, and truthful information in every manner when applying for entry into Canada."

    7. Due to Covid-19 travel restrictions, Sam (a Canadian citizen living in Canada) and Taylor (a citizen of the United States living in the United States) held a virtual wedding ceremony on Zoom.

Having received the marriage certificate, Sam is now able to sponsor Taylor as his spouse.

    8. Which of the following factors are assessed in an officer's determination of a conjugal relationship? (Select all that apply.)
        - [x] Economic interdependence
        - [x] Societal perception of the couple
        - [x] Cohabitation
        - [ ] A couple's subjective belief about their relationship
        > According to *Amandeep v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, (d), **a couple's subjective belief** about their relationship status, **does not factor into the definition of a conjugal relationship**. An officer must base their decision on the objective evidence before them.

    9. An assessment of the genuineness of spousal relationships stems from which one of IRPA's policy goals?
        - [ ] To see that families are reunited in Canada.
        - [ ] To enrich and strengthen the social and cultural fabric of Canadian society.

    10. Jordan's common law partner is being sponsored through the Spouse or Common Law Partner in Canada Class. Jordan's partner would like to go back to visit their home country to attend a family member's wedding. What advice should you give Jordan's partner?

        - [ ] Advise Jordan's partner to travel to their home country for the wedding as there is no risk to the sponsorship application.
        - [x] Advise Jordan's partner not to travel internationally as doing so may cancel the sponsorship application if they are refused entry back into Canada.
        - [ ] Advise Jordan that so long as he travels with his partner to the wedding, that there is no risk to the sponsorship application.
        > The IRCC's instructions concerning the Spouse or Common Law Partner in Canada Class note:
        > "If your spouse or common-law partner leaves Canada before becoming a permanent resident, they may not be allowed to come back. This is especially true if they need a Temporary Resident Visa or an eTA [Electronic Travel Authorization] to enter Canada. If your spouse or partner can't return to Canada, you must submit a new overseas sponsorship application."
