## Notes

??? note "Tutorial notes"

    - Sunday 9:00am.
    - Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada, "Public policy for spouse or common-law partner in Canada (SCLPC) class or family class applicants to apply in Canada [R205(a) – **A74**] – International Mobility Program (IMP)" (07 December 2023), [online: Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/special-initiatives-pilot-project/partner.html){:target="\_blank"}.
    - Chernenko v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), [2014 CanLII 104468 (CA IRB)](http://canlii.ca/t/hqhl6){:target="\_blank"}.
        - [2] At issue in this appeal is whether subsection [117(9)(d)](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/regu/sor-2002-227/latest/sor-2002-227.html#sec117subsec9_smooth){:target="\_blank"} of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (the “Regulations”)[2] applies, thereby excluding the applicant from consideration as a member of the family class.
        - [33] The Supreme Court in [*M v H*](https://canlii.ca/t/1fqm4){:target="\_blank"} endorsed the approach taken by the Ontario District Court in *Molodowich*. Most notably, the court recognized that **not all the factors discussed in *Molodowich* will be present to the same degree in every relationship**.
        - [46] Mr. Justice Hutchison in *Bellis* laid out a set of criteria for assessing conjugal partnerships similar to those found in *Molodowich*. However, in neither *Bellis* nor *Molodowich* are the factors intended to “define” a conjugal relationship. **A conjugal relationship is defined by more than just the sum of the outwardly observable characteristics; it also includes the parties’ states of mind.** The criteria described in *Molodowich* and *Bellis* are observable characteristics that assist in assessing the underlying nature of the relationship; they assist in determining the parties’ intent and commitment.
