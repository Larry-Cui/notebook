    - A38 (health inadmissibility), spouse and child are exempt from this provision.
    - A39 (financial reasons), (1) unable or unwilling to support; (2) adequate arrangements for care and support been made.

??? note "Policy and Cases"

    - Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada, "Public policy for **spouse or common-law partner in Canada (SCLPC)** class or family class applicants to apply in Canada [R205(a) – **A74**] – International Mobility Program (IMP)" (07 December 2023), [online: Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/special-initiatives-pilot-project/partner.html){:target="\_blank"}.
    - Chernenko v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), [2014 CanLII 104468 (CA IRB)](http://canlii.ca/t/hqhl6){:target="\_blank"}.
        - [2] At issue in this appeal is whether subsection [117(9)(d)](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/regu/sor-2002-227/latest/sor-2002-227.html#sec117subsec9_smooth){:target="\_blank"} of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (the “Regulations”)[2] applies, thereby excluding the applicant from consideration as a member of the family class.
        - [33] The Supreme Court in [*M v H*](https://canlii.ca/t/1fqm4){:target="\_blank"} endorsed the approach taken by the Ontario District Court in *Molodowich*. Most notably, the court recognized that **not all the factors discussed in *Molodowich* will be present to the same degree in every relationship**.
        - [45] Similarly, Madam Justice Heneghan in her judgment in *Walia*,[23](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/irb/doc/2014/2014canlii104468/2014canlii104468.html#_ftn23){:target="\_blank"}  drawing from a decision of the British Columbia County Court in Bellis,[24](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/irb/doc/2014/2014canlii104468/2014canlii104468.html#_ftn24){:target="\_blank"}  found:
            - The word “co-habit” has been interpreted as meaning a “marriage-like” relationship characterized by the features of financial interdependence, a sexual relationship, a common principal residence, mutual obligations to share the responsibility of running the home and the “**expectation each day that there be continued mutual dependency**”
        - [46] Mr. Justice Hutchison in *Bellis* laid out a set of criteria for assessing conjugal partnerships similar to those found in *Molodowich*. However, in neither *Bellis* nor *Molodowich* are the factors intended to “define” a conjugal relationship. **A conjugal relationship is defined by more than just the sum of the outwardly observable characteristics; it also includes the parties’ states of mind.** The criteria described in *Molodowich* and *Bellis* are observable characteristics that assist in assessing the underlying nature of the relationship; they assist in determining the parties’ intent and commitment.

??? note "5 questions asked during a consultation"

    - Who can I sponsor? (R 117)
        - spouse

    - What kinds of documents should I be preparing for my application?
        - don't be afraid to explore **H&C grounds**.
    - I did not declare my family member when I received PR. What are my options?
        - R 117(9)(d): "subject to subsection (10), the sponsor previously made an application for permanent residence and became a permanent resident and, at the time of that application, the foreign national was a non-accompanying family member of the sponsor and was not examined."
        - not only the application will be refused, but the IRCC or CBSA might go after the sponsor for mis-representation.
    - What happens if the file is refused?
        - Appeal to IRB(IAD) for outside.
        - apply for leave for judicial review for inside.

??? note "Optional: overcome criminal inadmissibility"

    - Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada, “Overcoming criminal inadmissibility” (1 August 2015), [online: Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/inadmissibility/overcome-criminal-convictions.html){:target="\_blank"}.

## Quizzes

??? note "Module 2 Knowledge Check"

    1. Alek is a permanent resident of Canada who came to Canada as a Convention Refugee. After several years of being in Canada, Alek discovered that he had a six-year-old son whom he now wishes to sponsor. Will Alek be able to sponsor his son?
        - [ ] No, Alek cannot sponsor his son because he was not declared in Alek's application for permanent residence.
        - [ ] No, Alek cannot sponsor his son because he was not declared in Alek's refugee claim.
        - [x] Yes, Alek can **sponsor his son even though he was not declared** in Alek's application for permanent residence.
        - [ ] Both (a) and (b).
        > While section 117(9)(d) of IRPR states that foreign nationals are not members of the Family Class if they are not examined in a sponsor's previous application for permanent residence, **a temporary public policy on May 31, 2019**, was introduced to facilitate immigration of those excluded under 117(9)(d). **Without this public policy, Alek could still make a humanitarian and compassionate request for the sponsorship to be approved.**

    2. The humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) provision only allows for an exemption for Canadian children born directly to the applicant.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        > The child or children under examination do not need to be Canadian born, but can also include a foreign-born child or children, or a child or children residing outside of Canada. Furthermore, the relationship between the applicant and the child or children does not even have to be a parent-child relationship. **"Any child directly affected" could be any child in the applicant's life who would be adversely affected should the applicant be required to leave.** This could include a grandchild, niece or nephew, adopted child, foster child, or child otherwise de facto dependent.

    3. Kimberly is sponsoring Zahid for permanent residency as her spouse. During stage 2 of the processing, however, concerns were raised with respect to Zahid's involvement in an organization in his home country that has led to security concerns. In assessing whether or not Zahid is inadmissible, the visa officer will assess
        - [ ] if the security concerns exist on a balance of probabilities.
        - [x] if there are **reasonable grounds to believe** the security concerns exist.
        - [ ] if it is beyond a reasonable doubt that the security concerns exist.
        - [ ] if there is suspicion that security concerns exist.
        > **The standard of proof for inadmissibility to Canada** is defined under **section 33 of the IRPA as "reasonable grounds to believe.**"

    4. In *Tharmalingam v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)* the sponsor appealed a negative decision to sponsor his spouse based on financial inadmissibility pursuant to s. 39 of the [Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)](https://canlii.ca/t/56cjs){:target="\_blank"}. Here the test for financially inadmissibility was articulated. In his decision, the member found that a foreign national is financially inadmissible if: (Select all that apply.)
        - [ ] They have a poor history of sound financial management.
        - [x] They are or will be unable or unwilling to support themselves and their dependents.
        - [x] Adequate arrangements have not been made for care and support other than social assistance.
        - [ ] There is a low likelihood they will obtain sustainable employment.
        > The two-part test is detailed in paragraph 18 of *Tharmalingam v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2014 CanLII 99597 (CA IRB)](https://canlii.ca/t/grpsr){:target="\_blank"}.

    5. Most criminal inadmissibilities fall under what section of IRPA?
        - [ ] Section 34: Security
        - [ ] Section 35: Human or International Rights Violations
        - [x] Section 36: Serious Criminality and Criminality
        - [ ] Section 37: Organized Criminality
        > As stated in Chapter 9 of Family Class Sponsorship, inadmissibilities under section 36 of IRPA, labelled as "serious criminality" and "criminality" are the most common, whereas inadmissabilities under sections 34, 35, and 37 of IRPA occur relatively infrequently.

    6. Junio is the sponsor in a sponsorship application for their family members, Chloe and Lin. Junio completed all the application forms for Chloe and Lin. In the application forms, Junio wrote that Lin received her college degree even though she had not yet graduated. Junio expected Lin would graduate a month after submitting the application so thought there was no harm in the answer and did not consult with Lin. Because of Covid-19 , Lin did not complete her studies and questions are now being raised by the visa officer about Lin's admissibility.This scenario is an example of:
        - [ ] Withholding (omission)
        - [ ] Direct misrepresentation
        - [x] Indirect misrepresentation
        - [ ] Criminal inadmissibility
        > Indirect misrepresentation is when **a third party is the one who misrepresents or withholds information** on the applicant's behalf Wang, Xiao Qiang v M.C.I. and can occur when a sponsor misrepresents on behalf of an applicant. In accordance with s 40(1) of IRPA, a foreign national may be deemed inadmissible for misrepresentation due to indirect misrepresentation or withholding material facts.

    7. Samuel is looking to sponsor his mother, Janette, for permanent residency. Janette, however, is concerned that she will be found inadmissible on health grounds because of her positive HIV status. An officer, in determining Janette's admissibility, will need to assess: (Select all that apply.)
        - [x] Janette's particular circumstances.
        - [x] Janette's likely demand on public services.
        - [ ] Janette's eligibility to access public services.
        - [x] Janette's intention and ability to pay for health services.
        > The Supreme Court in *Hilewitz v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)*; *De Jong v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2005] 2 SCR determined that, in assessing admissibility on health grounds, the above factors must all be considered with the exception of (c) : "the wording of the provision shows that medical officers must assess **likely demands on social services**, not mere eligibility for them." para 54. If Janette was the spouse instead of the mother of Samuel, then she would not be inadmissible on medical grounds.

    8. An applicant under the Spouse or Common-Law Partner in Canada Class (SCLPC) may request a s 25(1) exemption to overcome any one of the criteria under the class. When they do so, which of the following statements is true? (Select all that apply.)
        - [ ] The application will continue to be processed under the SCLPC.
        - [ ] The application will be transferred to the Humanitarian & Compassionate (H&C) processing queue.
        - [x] The application will continue to be processed under the SCLPC as long as the applicant remains the subject of the sponsorship application.
        - [x] The application will continue to be processed under the SCLPC as long as the applicant remains the spouse or common-law partner of the sponsor and they cohabitate in Canada.
        > They will continue to be processed as part of the SCLPC as long as they meet the requirements for the class set out in s124 of the IRPR. This was affirmed in *Khandaker v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*.

    9. Zhang and Li's spousal sponsorship application was refused and appealed to the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD). In their appeal, Zhang and Li are arguing that the application should be approved on humanitarian and compassionate grounds because of the hardship of their separation. In assessing their application:
        - [ ] the hardship from separation is sufficient grounds for a positive determination on humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) grounds.
        - [x] the hardship from separation **is a factor** that will be considered in assessing H&C grounds.
        - [ ] the hardship from separation is an unfortunate but inevitable result of a refused application and is not considered in an H&C assessment.
        > In accordance with the IRCC's Guidelines on Humanitarian and Compassionate Stage 1 processioning in Canada, submissions highlighting that the **separation of the couple would cause extreme hardship are not necessarily sufficient grounds** for a positive determination on their own as the H&C assessment must include all the factors relevant to the couples' specific circumstances.

    10. Denali, 44 years old, has been in Canada for several years to take care of her mother. She has held temporary visitor status during this time. Denali would like to apply for permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. Which of the following can be used as evidence to prove the **"establishment in Canada" factor** in this assessment? (Select all that apply.)
        - [x] The **length** of time she has been in Canada.
        - [x] Involvement in **language** training programs.
        - [x] Periods of volunteer and community **involvement**.
        - [x] **Established connections** with friends and neighbours in their communities.
        > Each of the above factors are common components of determining establishment in accordance with the IRCC Guidelines "Humanitarian and compassionate assessment: Establishment in Canada."

    11. When an IRCC decision-maker considers the best interests of the child under section 25(1) of IRPA, which of the following statements is accurate?
        - [ ] Only children born in Canada are eligible for consideration
        - [x] Any child impacted by the decision is eligible for consideration, so long as that child does not have a pending refugee claim (either at the Refugee Protection Division or the Refugee Appeal Division)
        - [ ] Anyone who has a pending refugee determination, who has a child, is eligible for consideration
        - [ ] Anyone who has a pending refugee appeal, who has a child, is eligible for consideration
        > According to s. 25(1.2) of IRPA, the Minister may not examine an H&C request in the case of (a), (c), and (d). Accordingly, a foreign national whose **refugee** claim was rejected or abandoned more than **12 months prior** may benefit from an **H&C assessment**.

    12. Jason is a foreign national who currently resides outside of Canada. He would like to make an application for a permanent resident visa under the Family Class sponsorship class on humanitarian and compassionate grounds. Which statement is true?
        - [x] Jason can make this application from outside of Canada.
        - [ ] Jason will not be able to make this application from outside of Canada as H&C applications can only be processed from within the Canada.
        - [ ] Jason will be able to make this application from outside Canada, if he has spent a minimum of two of the last five years living in Canada.
        - [ ] Jason will be able to make this application from outside Canada, if he has spent a minimum of three of the last five years living in Canada.
        > Under s **66 of the IRPR**, a foreign national who is outside of Canada may make an application on H&C grounds through making a request in writing accompanied by an application for a permanent resident visa. There are no residency requirements.

    13. An applicant in a sponsorship application **cannot** be found **medically inadmissible** if: (Select all that apply.)

        - [x] they are a member of the Family Class and are the spouse or common-law partner of the sponsor.
        - [ ] they are a member of the Family Class, and the sponsor has no relatives living in Canada.
        - [ ] they are a member of the Family Class and are a child of the sponsor.
        > Section **38(2)(a) of IRPA** stipulates that a foreign national is not inadmissible on health grounds if they are determined to be a member of the family class and to be the **spouse, common-law partner or child** of a sponsor within the meaning of the regulations.

    14. Keya is looking to sponsor her spouse Arjun as a permanent resident in Canada. Arjun is currently living in Canada as a temporary resident. Arjun, however, has an eighteen-year-old son abroad, Abeer, who has criminal convictions that make him inadmissible to Canada under section 36 of Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA). Will Arjun also be inadmissible?
        - [x] Yes, Arjun will be found inadmissible because Abeer is inadmissible
        - [ ] No, Arjun will not be inadmissible because Abeer is a non-accompanying dependant.
        - [ ] No, Arjun will not be inadmissible because he is a temporary resident.
        - [ ] No, Arjun will not be inadmissible because Abeer is inadmissible under section 36.
        > In accordance with section **42(1) of IRPA** and **section 23 of IRPR**, Arjun will be inadmissible for permanent residence because Abeer is inadmissible.
        > Arjun can, however, still be admissible as a temporary resident because Abeer is not inadmissible under sections 34, 35, or 37 of IRPA. s 42(2) IRPA.

    15. Kalvin submitted a sponsorship application for his 10-year-old son 12 months ago and is waiting for the result. Kalvin also has a 23-year-old son whom he did not include on his initial application but would now like to include him on humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) grounds. What next step should Kalvin take?
        - [ ] Withdraw his application and submit a new application including his son on H&C grounds.
        - [ ] Wait until a decision has been made then request that his son be added as a dependant to the application on H&C grounds.
        - [x] Submit an application for the son to be included as a dependent on H&C grounds while the original sponsorship application is being processed.
        - [ ] Kalvin cannot add his son as a dependant to his application.
        > A request for an exemption is permitted to take place at any time throughout the processing of the application. However, the request must include all the information, evidence, and factors to be considered on H&C grounds and **must be submitted before a final decision has been made on the sponsorship application**. IRCC Guidelines 5291- Humanitarian and Compassionate Considerations.
