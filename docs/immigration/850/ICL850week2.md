## Notes

??? note "Tutorial notes"

    - Sunday 9:00am.

??? note "Policy and Cases"

    - Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada, "Public policy for spouse or common-law partner in Canada (SCLPC) class or family class applicants to apply in Canada [R205(a) – **A74**] – International Mobility Program (IMP)" (07 December 2023), [online: Government of Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/special-initiatives-pilot-project/partner.html){:target="\_blank"}.
    - Chernenko v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), [2014 CanLII 104468 (CA IRB)](http://canlii.ca/t/hqhl6){:target="\_blank"}.
        - [2] At issue in this appeal is whether subsection [117(9)(d)](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/regu/sor-2002-227/latest/sor-2002-227.html#sec117subsec9_smooth){:target="\_blank"} of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (the “Regulations”)[2] applies, thereby excluding the applicant from consideration as a member of the family class.
        - [33] The Supreme Court in [*M v H*](https://canlii.ca/t/1fqm4){:target="\_blank"} endorsed the approach taken by the Ontario District Court in *Molodowich*. Most notably, the court recognized that **not all the factors discussed in *Molodowich* will be present to the same degree in every relationship**.
        - [46] Mr. Justice Hutchison in *Bellis* laid out a set of criteria for assessing conjugal partnerships similar to those found in *Molodowich*. However, in neither *Bellis* nor *Molodowich* are the factors intended to “define” a conjugal relationship. **A conjugal relationship is defined by more than just the sum of the outwardly observable characteristics; it also includes the parties’ states of mind.** The criteria described in *Molodowich* and *Bellis* are observable characteristics that assist in assessing the underlying nature of the relationship; they assist in determining the parties’ intent and commitment.

??? note "5 questions asked during a consultation"

    - Who can I sponsor? (R 117)
        - spouse
        - parents/grandparents
        - dependent children
    - What is the income requirement to sponsor a family member?
        - spouse, common law partner, dependent children don't need MNI
        - [Applications under family classes: Assessing the sponsor](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/non-economic-classes/family-class-assessing-sponsor.html){:target="\_blank"}
    - What kinds of documents should I be preparing for my application?
        - don't be afraid to explore **H&C grounds**.
    - I did not declare my family member when I received PR. What are my options?
        - R 117(9)(d): "subject to subsection (10), the sponsor previously made an application for permanent residence and became a permanent resident and, at the time of that application, the foreign national was a non-accompanying family member of the sponsor and was not examined."
        - not only the application will be refused, but the IRCC or CBSA might go after the sponsor for mis-representation.
    - What happens if the file is refused?
        - Appeal to IRB(IAD) for outside.
        - apply for leave for judicial review for inside.
