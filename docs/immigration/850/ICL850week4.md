???+ note "module content"

    - The strength of a sponsorship application or an appeal before the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) often comes down to the **evidence** that was included in the initial application or submitted in support of an appeal.
    - In Module 4, you will learn about the quality and type of evidence needed to establish the **genuineness** of a spousal relationship in a sponsorship appeal hearing before the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD).
    - From low to high standard of proof:
        - Reasonable ground to believe:
            - A33: The facts that constitute inadmissibility under sections **34 to 37** include facts arising from omissions and, unless otherwise provided, include facts for which there are **reasonable grounds to believe** that they have occurred, are occurring or may occur.
        - “Balance of probabilities,” or “more likely than not”
            - In most appeals, the **IAD** applies this standard of proof to the evidence and to the final determination.
            - The **RPD** and the **RAD** to prove that your client is at risk of torture or other cruel and unusual treatment of punishment pursuant to section **97** of the IRPA (easy to stay)
        - Serious possibility
            - The **RPD** and the **RAD** apply this standard for assessments of a well-founded fear of persecution under section **96** of the IRPA. (hard to claim as a refugee)
