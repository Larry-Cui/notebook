??? note "module content"

    - The strength of a sponsorship application or an appeal before the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) often comes down to the **evidence** that was included in the initial application or submitted in support of an appeal.
    - In Module 4, you will learn about the quality and type of evidence needed to establish the **genuineness** of a spousal relationship in a sponsorship appeal hearing before the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD).
    - From low to high standard of proof:
        - Reasonable ground to believe:
            - A33: The facts that constitute inadmissibility under sections **34 to 37** include facts arising from omissions and, unless otherwise provided, include facts for which there are **reasonable grounds to believe** that they have occurred, are occurring or may occur.
        - “Balance of probabilities,” or “more likely than not”
            - In most appeals, the **IAD** applies this standard of proof to the evidence and to the final determination.
            - The **RPD** and the **RAD** to prove that your client is at risk of torture or other cruel and unusual treatment of punishment pursuant to section **97** of the IRPA (easy to stay)
        - Serious possibility
            - The **RPD** and the **RAD** apply this standard for assessments of a well-founded fear of persecution under section **96** of the IRPA. (hard to claim as a refugee)

??? note "Q&A with a former IRB Member"

    1. When an IRB member says they are "weighing the evidence", what exactly does this mean?
        - It means that they are considering the evidence that is before them and applying to it the appropriate significance in their decision based on the **quality** of the evidence and the **relevance** to the decision they need to make.

    2. Is all evidence in an IRB proceeding equally relevant?
        - No. Relevance is determined based on the degree to which the evidence is applicable to the issues that must be decided by the member. Evidence will likely be seen as more relevant, the stronger the nexus between that evidence and the issues that must be decided. For example, if an issue is whether or not the applicant is in a genuine marital relationship with their spouse, a DNA test showing that they have a child together is likely to be highly relevant. In contrast, a letter from a family friend discussing how lovely the applicant is, is likely to be deemed less relevant because it does not support or negate the key issue in the case.

    3. What are the primary considerations of an IRB member when assessing evidence in a proceeding?
        - Pursuant to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), members of the IRB are not bound by the technical rules of evidence and may receive and base a decision on **evidence that is adduced in a proceeding** that is considered credible or trustworthy in the circumstances (see **s 170** of the IRPA). As a result, members of the IRB must ensure that the evidence is relevant to the determination that they have to make and they must ensure that the evidence is credible and trustworthy. This includes ensuring that the evidence is coming from a reliable source and is not the product of torture.

    4. What are the hallmarks of "reliable evidence" in an IRB proceeding?
        - What amounts to reliable evidence will **depend on the facts and situation at hand**. For example, research evidence will generally be viewed as reliable if it is recent and from a reputable source and corroborated by other sources. Evidence from witnesses will be assessed based on the witness’s credibility, including the consistency of their testimony and their knowledge and ability to testify about the facts that they are testifying to. Documentary evidence is likely to be assessed based on the source of the document, the nature of the document, and whether it has internal markers of credibility (is it dated, signed, set out as such a document ought to be, etc.), and whether it can be corroborated with, or at least is consistent with, other documentation.

    5. As counsel for the individual in an IRB proceeding, what arguments assist in showing that more weight should be given to a certain piece of evidence?
        - Establishing that the evidence has the hallmarks of **reliability** are important in demonstrating that the evidence that you bring forward should be given weight. **Set out in your submissions where the evidence came from, and how it is supported by, or consistent with, other evidence that you have provided.** Also set out other markers that would support a finding that it is credible (Is it sworn testimony? Does the evidence come from a particularly reputable or objective source? Is the evidence internally consistent? etc.). Be sure to set out how the evidence that you are putting forward actually supports the factual assertions that you are saying it supports.

    6. As Minister's counsel in an IRB proceeding, what arguments assist in showing that less weight should be given to a certain piece of evidence?
        - Demonstrating that evidence does not have the hallmarks of **credibility** or reliability will help to ensure that the evidence is given less weight in a proceeding. **Arguments which demonstrate that the evidence is inconsistent with, or not supported by, any other evidence are often useful in demonstrating that the evidence should be given little weight.** Arguments that demonstrate that the evidence is self-serving, not from a reliable source, and does not have other indicators of reliability (e.g., a letter that is unsigned or not dated, receipts that do not have information about what they are for, etc.) also assist in establishing that little weight should be given to the evidence. Finally, pointing out that the evidence being offered **does not actually support the proposition** that it is said to support can also assist in showing that less weight should be given to that evidence.

    7. How does an individual's credibility impact on the weighing of evidence?
        - Generally the more credible a person’s evidence the more weight it will be given. Similarly the less credible a person’s evidence the less weight their testimony will be given. The caveat here is that in addition to credibility the person’s evidence must be relevant to the decision makers determination to be given weight. For example, a person can testify credibly that the applicant always pays their rent on time. But if the issue at hand is whether the applicant is in a genuine marital relationship with somebody, that credible testimony may not be relevant in which case it won’t be given weight in the member’s assessment.

    8. When the "burden of proof" rests on the appellant, claimant, or person concerned, what does this mean?
        - The party that has the **burden of proof** is responsible for **leading enough credible and trustworthy evidence to establish their case** on a particular standard of proof. **In a sponsorship appeal hearing**, that standard of proof is **a balance of probabilities** which means that the party with the burden of proof must show that it is more likely than not that their version of events occurred. In such cases, if the member finds that either outcome is equally likely, then the party with the burden of proof would lose as they would not have established their case to the necessary standard.

    9. What is the standard of proof that the IAD member applies to **sponsorship appeal** hearings?
        - The standard of proof in a sponsorship appeal hearing is **a balance of probabilities**. That is, the party with the burden of proof has to establish that it is more likely than not (50% + 1) that their version of events occurred.

## Quizzes

??? note "Module 4 Knowledge Check"

    1. Jenny is an immigration consultant. She represented clients in an appeal before the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) where a sponsorship application was refused based on a finding that the sponsor did not meet income requirements. Three months before the hearing, Jenny comes into possession of updated financial information for the sponsor that they would like to rely on at the hearing.

        In disclosing the documents, Jenny is required to do which of the following?Select all that apply.

        - [x] Provide a copy of the documents **to the other party**.
        - [ ] Provide a copy of the documents to the IAD no later than 30 days before the hearing.
        - [x] Provide a **written statement** to the IAD of how the copy of the documents was given to the other party.
        - [x] Provide a copy of the document **to the IAD immediately**, as the deadline for disclosure has passed.
        > (A), (B), and (D) are all required when disclosing documents with the IAD in accordance with IAD rule 30. B is incorrect as there is a requirement to disclose documents before the IAD **no later than 20 days before the hearing**.

    2. Genevieve received a conviction in Canada under the Criminal Code. The   Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) hearing will determine whether or not she is inadmissible on the grounds of criminality.

        In assessing the evidence before them, the IAD will use what standard of proof to determine if Genevieve is inadmissible?

        - [ ] They will assess if the facts that lead to a finding of inadmissibility occurred on a balance of probabilities.
        - [ ] They will assess if the facts that lead to a finding of inadmissibility occurred beyond a reasonable doubt.
        - [x] They will assess if there are **reasonable grounds** to believe the facts occurred that would lead to a finding of inadmissibility.
        - [ ] They will assess if there is a serious possibility that the facts occurred that would lead to a finding of inadmissibility.
        > In accordance with **s 33 and s 37 of IRPA**, the facts that constitute **inadmissibility** concerning criminality (for convictions inside of Canada) are facts in which there are **reasonable grounds to believe** they have occurred.

    3. Priyanka applied to sponsor Arjun as a member of the family class. The application was refused. The reasons for refusal state that there was insufficient evidence to show that their marriage was not entered into primarily to acquire status. In their appeal of the refusal before the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) which statement is true?
        - [ ] The burden of proof is on the visa officer to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the marriage was entered into primarily to acquire status.
        - [ ] The burden of proof is on the visa officer to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the marriage was entered into primarily to acquire status.
        - [x] The burden of proof is on the appellant to prove, on a balance of probabilities, that the marriage was not entered into primarily to acquire status.
        - [ ] The burden of proof is on the appellant to prove, beyond a reasonable doubt, that the marriage was not entered into primarily to acquire status.
        > As stated in *Mann v Canada* 2005 CanLII 56894 (CA IRB) at an Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) hearing, **the appellant has the burden of proof, on a balance of probabilities, that the marriage was not entered into primarily to acquire status** (at para 3).

    4. With respect to the admissibility of evidence, which of the following statements is correct?
        - [x] Probative value is a matter of degree and relevance is a binary concept.
        - [ ] Probative value is a binary concept and relevance is a matter of degree.
        - [ ] Probative value and relevance are binary concepts.
        - [ ] Probative value and relevance are matters of degree.
        > As stated in *Magonza v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)* 2019 FC 14 (para 23), "**while probative value is a matter of degree, relevance is a binary concept** [i.e., something is either relevant or not relevant]. As long as a piece of evidence has some probative value, it is relevant."

    5. Sam and Jo are in a same-sex conjugal relationship, and Sam is trying to sponsor Jo. The initial application, however, was refused as there were concerns about the genuineness of their relationship.

        In assessing the appeal, the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) should take which of the following factors into account? (Select all that apply.)

        - [x] That it may be difficult for the couple to display their relationship publicly.
        - [x] That it may be difficult for the couple to confirm the relationship by showing evidence of economic support for one another.
        - [x] That the couple's relationship may not evolve along the same trajectory as that of an opposite-sex couple.
        - [x] That it may be difficult for the couple to verify the relationship (e.g., showing evidence of living together).
        > Each of the above factors should be considered by the IAD in assessing the genuineness of a SOGIE-diverse relationship in accordance with Sections 10.1 and 10.2 of the Chairperson's Guideline 9: Proceedings Before the IRB involving SOGIE.

    6. Charlie, a Canadian Citizen, and Hayden, a foreign national, are appealing a sponsorship application refusal based on the genuineness of their relationship. To assist them in their appeal, they have reached out to Hayden's sister. She is in Canada and would like her brother to be in Canada. Charlie and Hayden have asked her to speak to the strength of their relationship.

        Which statement is true concerning the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD)'s treatment of this support letter?

        - [ ] The IAD should not admit this letter into evidence because it is self-serving.
        - [ ] The IAD should admit this letter into evidence as letters from family members are not classified as self-serving evidence.
        - [x] The IAD should admit this letter into evidence even though it is self-serving and then assess its weight.
        - [ ] The IAD should not admit this letter into evidence as it has little probative value.
        > In accordance with IRCC's Guidelines on weighing evidence, Hayden's **sister's letter is self-serving** in that it was created for the purpose of the hearing to bolster the case. **The Federal Court has repeatedly criticized the rejection of evidence provided by relatives and family members of an applicant solely because such evidence is self-serving.**
        > In *Magonza*, the Federal Court observed that it is a reviewable error to dismiss evidence in its entirety for the sole reason that it is self-interested. As such, the evidence should be admitted and the IAD should assess its weight.

    7. In her appeal before the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD), Marcela submitted a letter from an adoption agency as part of her evidence to prove that the adoption of her son was not primarily for the purpose of acquiring status. The adoption letter, however, was full of typographical errors and inconsistencies, which led the IAD to question its genuineness. à

        The evidentiary issue in this scenario concerns the _________ of the evidence. (Select two options.)

        - [x] **credibility**
        - [ ] probative value
        - [ ] relevance
        - [x] we**i**ght
        > The issue at hand directly speaks to the credibility of the evidence. In accordance with *Magonza v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)* 2019 FC 14 (para 16), credibility is the answer to the question "is this a trustworthy source of information?"
        > The issue, however, also concerns the weight of the evidence, as the weight of evidence is a function of both credibility and probative value. As such, credibility concerns will impact the weight an officer gives a piece of evidence (para 29).

    8. The Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) is a federal administrative tribunal and, as such, is bound by the same rules of evidence for proceedings as the Federal Court of Canada.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        > In accordance with s 175(1)(b) of IRPA, the IAD, in any proceeding before it, is not bound by any legal or technical rules of evidence.

    9. Jose applied to sponsor his wife. The application was refused on the grounds that Jose does not meet all the requirements of a sponsor. During an Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) hearing, Jose testified concerning the humanitarian and compassionate reasons as to why the sponsorship application should still be approved despite his not meeting the requirement. Following his testimony, Jose opted not to call his wife to testify though she was at the hearing and able to do so. Which of the following statements is correct?
        - [ ] The IAD should draw a negative inference from Jose's wife not testifying because she was available to testify.
        - [ ] The IAD should draw a negative inference from Jose's wife not testifying as both the sponsor and applicant are required to testify in an appeal before the IAD.
        - [x] The IAD should not draw a negative inference from Jose's wife not testifying as an applicant is not required to testify in all appeals.
        - [ ] Both a) and b).
        > In accordance with *Mann v Canada* 2005 CanLII 56894 (CA IRB) (at para 9), "**the applicant is not required to testify in all appeals**. In many cases, the oral evidence of the appellant (i.e., sponsor) – often in conjunction with the documentary evidence—will be sufficient to determine whether the legislative test is met."

    10. Shortly after Kallum moved to Toronto in 2019 he filed a parental sponsorship application for his mother. The sponsorship was refused, and Kallum is appealing the refusal to the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD). The hearing is scheduled for later this year in Toronto. Kallum, however, has since moved to Ottawa and would like to have the hearing there. Kallum doesn't have a car and is not comfortable taking public transportation back to Toronto.

        In deciding if the hearing can be moved to Ottawa the IAD will consider all ==**except**== which one of the following factors?

        - [ ] Whether the change in location would allow the proceeding to be full and proper.
        - [x] Whether the change in location is in the best interest of the appellant.
        - [ ] Whether the appellant is residing in the location where they want the proceeding to be held.
        - [ ] Whether the change in location would likely delay or slow the proceeding.
        > All the above factors must be considered by the IAD when assessing if a change of location can be made for an IAD proceeding with the exception of (b) in accordance with rule 88(1) of the IAD Rules.

??? note "Midterm Practice Quiz"

    1. George is a Canadian citizen who is applying to sponsor his wife Tina who lives in China with their two children. As George is fluent in English and Tina is not, he is the one who completed the application. Tina has a very minimal understanding of English and signs the papers that George sends to her without reading them carefully. When IRCC reviews the application, the officer discovers that there are major inconsistencies between the sponsorship application and a previous application for a temporary residence visa that Tina applied for 2 years ago. The officer determines that Tina is inadmissible on the grounds of misrepresentation under section 40 of the IRPA. Is Tina admissible?
        - [ ] No, Tina is inadmissible because she should have asked George to read the full application to her in a language that she understands before signing.
        - [ ] Yes, Tina is admissible because neither she nor George intended to deceive IRCC, and the mistakes were inadvertent.
        - [ ] Yes, Tina is admissible because she was not the one who filled out the application and should not be held responsible for the mistakes that George made without her knowing.
        - [x] No, Tina is inadmissible for indirect misrepresentation as her sponsor completed an application for her and included incorrect information without her knowledge.

    2. Raj had applied for and received permanent residence in Canada as the result of **an overseas sponsorship**. In his application, Raj omitted listing his 6-year-old child from a previous relationship. Raj was of the belief that he was to include only his current wife and children in the application and that when he would be interviewed by an immigration officer, he would inform the officers about his child from his previous relationship. He was, however, not interviewed by an officer and was instead granted permanent residence. Will Raj be permitted to sponsor his 6-year-old child?
        - [ ] Yes, if Raj can prove that the omission was not fraudulent then he can keep his permanent residency and his child can come to Canada as a dependent.
        - [ ] No, Raj will face lifetime exclusion for failing to mention all his dependents in his application.
        - [x] Yes, Raj will be permitted to sponsor his child in accordance with an Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) public policy to avoid the application of provisions 117(9)(d) and 125(1)(d) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR).
        - [ ] Raj must make an application under the Humanitarian and Compassionate (H&C) category seeking forgiveness for his omission from the Minister responsible.
        > Yes, there is a public policy under R.117 (9)(d), wherein **a temporary policy** has been introduced for certain persons excluded under paragraph 117(9)(d) and 125(1)(d) of the IRPR. This policy allows applicants under the family class such as Raj to seek exemption under this policy, provided he meets its requirements.

    3. Ahmed is eager to sponsor his mother, who resides in Lebanon. Living with his father, Karim, in Toronto, Ontario, Ahmed faces challenges meeting the minimum income requirements for sponsorship on his own. Fortunately, his father, Karim, a permanent resident of Canada for the past 5 years and divorced from Ahmed's mother, has agreed to co-sign the application. Ahmed is hopeful that the combined income of both himself and his father will fulfill the minimum requirements. Will Ahmed's father, Karim, be allowed to co-sign the application?
        - [ ] No, Ahmed's father cannot co-sign the application because he is elderly, and IRCC will not be satisfied that he can meet the obligation for a 20-year undertaking required to sponsor a parent or grandparent.
        - [x] No, Ahmed's father cannot co-sign the application because **only a spouse or common-law partner of a sponsor is permitted to be a co-signer** on the sponsorship application.
        - [ ] Yes, Ahmed's father is permitted to co-sign the application as long as he provides proof of income from the Canada Revenue Agency for the three consecutive taxation years immediately preceding the date of the sponsorship application.
        - [ ] Yes, Ahmed's father is permitted to co-sign the application because Ahmed's mother will be moving in with both of them, and they can jointly cover her expenses.

    4. Nour, an applicant for permanent residence in Canada, unintentionally provided incorrect information about her work experience in her application. The immigration authorities later discovered the error and determined it as misrepresentation. What consequence will Nour face due to this misrepresentation?
        - [ ] Nour will be required to reapply immediately with corrected information.
        - [x] Nour will face **a 5-year bar** from applying for permanent residence.
        - [ ] Nour's misrepresentation will have no impact on her permanent residence application.
        - [ ] Nour will be banned from applying for permanent residence for 2 years.
        > Misrepresentation in a permanent residence application results in a 5-year bar from applying for permanent residence, as indicated in the question. This reflects the consequences of providing false information in the immigration process.

    5. In the context of the Family Class category, what is the accurate requirement regarding medical tests for both the applicant and their dependents?
        - [ ] Only the applicant is subject to mandatory medical tests.
        - [x] **Both accompanying and non-accompanying dependents must undergo medical tests in addition to the applicant.**
        - [ ] The applicant and accompanying dependents are required to undergo medical tests.
        - [ ] Medical tests are not obligatory for either the applicant or their dependents.
        > s. 16 of IRPA and s, 29-30 IRPR.

    6. In the context of minimum necessary income for sponsorship, what does the term "**minimum necessary income**" refer to?
        - [x] The before-tax annual income necessary to support the sponsor, their family members, the sponsored foreign national, and every other person covered by a still-effective undertaking.
        - [ ] The annual income required to support only the sponsored foreign national and their family members.
        - [ ] The income threshold set by the sponsor's spouse or common-law partner for co-signing an undertaking.
        - [ ] The average income for urban areas of residence with 500,000 persons or more.

    7. According to section 117(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR), who qualifies as a member of the family class with respect to a sponsor?
        - [ ] The sponsor's sibling.
        - [x] The sponsor's dependent child.
        - [ ] The sponsor's cousin.
        - [ ] None of the above.

    8. Samantha and Gregory have been in a relationship for the past 16 months. While they lived together continuously for 8 months, Gregory was required to move to a different city without Samantha for the last 8 months of their relationship when his employer opened an office in a new location. Will Samantha and Gregory meet the eligibility requirements under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) to apply for sponsorship as a common-law couple?
        - [ ] Yes, Gregory and Samantha will meet the eligibility requirements because the only reason Gregory had to move was to maintain his employment.
        - [ ] No, Gregory and Samantha will not meet the eligibility requirements because they have not been cohabiting for the entire length of their relationship.
        - [x] No, Gregory and Samantha will not meet the eligibility requirements because they have not been cohabiting for 12 continuous months and their interruption in cohabitation is not temporary or short.
        - [ ] Yes, Gregory and Samantha will meet the eligibility requirements because they have been in a relationship for more than 12 months.

    9. Lily, a Canadian citizen, has recently married her long-term partner Carlos, who is a Colombian national. The couple married three months ago in a beautiful ceremony in Colombia. Carlos entered Canada as a visitor one month ago, and Lily plans to sponsor him. Carlos doesn't have an employer lined up yet, but is eager to know if he is eligible to work in Canada while the sponsorship gets processed. What is the best possible advice to give?
        - [ ] Carlos can get a work permit so long as he acquires an employer in Canada prior to filing the sponsorship.
        - [x] Carlos can get a work permit as soon as he qualifies under the Open work permit pilot program.
        - [ ] Carlos cannot get a work permit because the marriage took place in another country.
        - [ ] Carlos cannot get a work permit because he does not have an employer lined up in Canada.
        > Open work permit pilot program for permanent residence applicants in the **spouse or common-law partner in Canada class** (Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) exemption code A70): Link to more information.

    10. Under the spousal category, which of the following circumstances would render the relationship **ineligible for sponsorship**? Select all that apply.
        - [x] Where the sponsor is the spouse of another person.
        - [x] Where the marriage was performed without both spouses being physically present.
        - [x] Where the applicant is the common law partner of another person or the conjugal partner of another sponsor.
        - [x] Where the sponsor has previously sponsored a spouse, common-law partner, or conjugal partner, and **the undertaking has not ended**.
        > These factors are outlined in **S. 117** of the IRPA.

    11. Amelia is excited that her application to be a sponsor for her parents from Honduras has finally been approved. She provided all of the necessary documents and application criteria to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) and is waiting for her parents to complete their medical tests in order to receive their permanent residence. As part of her application package, Amelia provided her Notice of Assessment from the Canada Revenue Agency for the previous three years, which showed that she was making the minimum necessary income (MNI) to be approved for sponsorship. While waiting for her parents to receive their visas, Amelia was laid off from work and no longer has any income. Will losing her job be a problem even though she has already been approved as the sponsor?
        - [ ] No, Amelia does not need to worry because she already gave all of the evidence that was necessary to prove that she met the requirements to sponsor.
        - [x] Yes, Amelia does need to be concerned and aware that a sponsor must continue to meet the minimum necessary income (MNI) until the day their sponsored family members are granted permanent resident status.
        - [ ] Yes, Amelia does need to be concerned and aware that once her parents arrive, she will have to show IRCC her plan to pay for them to stay with her for a period of 20 years.
        - [ ] No, Amelia does not need to worry because no one at IRCC will check to see what her ongoing income is. They only cared about what her previous income was in processing the application.

    12. Kelly is a citizen of Canada and a resident of Ontario. Kelly suffers from a disability. She wants to sponsor her spouse, a citizen of Jamaica, but she is not sure if she can do so since she receives assistance for her physical disability. Which advice to Kelly would be the most correct and prudent?
        - [ ] Persons with any disability cannot sponsor anybody irrespective of their need for disability benefits.
        - [x] Persons with disabilities can sponsor individuals that qualify under the Family Class even if they are on disability benefits.
        - [ ] Persons with disabilities can sponsor individuals that qualify under the Family Class if they have a guarantor that can co-sign for financial support.
        - [ ] Persons with disabilities can sponsor individuals that qualify under the Family Class if the disability benefit provided is not more than 35% percent of their total income.
        > See IRPR s. 133(1)(k) is not in receipt of social assistance for a reason **other than disability**.

    13. Tom, a foreign national, was convicted of impaired driving in Canada and thereafter was granted a record suspension (formerly a pardon). For the purposes of immigration, will Tom be considered admissible to Canada?
        - [ ] No, a record suspension does not overcome a conviction for the purposes of immigration to Canada.
        - [x] Yes, a record suspension would make Tom admissible in Canada.
        - [ ] No, Tom is a threat to Canadian society and therefore will remain inadmissible in Canada.
        - [ ] Yes, but only if he can pay monetary compensation to the pedestrian's family and they agree to co-sign the suspension then he will be admissible in Canada.
        > s. 36 of the IRPA requires a conviction. The effect of **a record suspension is the removal of the conviction**.  See also s. 36(3)(b) of the IRPA.

    14. Julian is a Canadian citizen and applied to sponsor his son David to Canada from the Netherlands. He was pleased to receive a notice from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada ("IRCC") that he was approved to be a sponsor for David, but unfortunately, his application was refused at the second stage of processing due to his failure to meet the requirements for sponsorship. Julian is now looking for help to decide if he can appeal or not.
        - [ ] No, Julian cannot appeal the negative decision to the IAD because a Canadian citizen is only able to appeal the decision about a spouse, common law partner, or conjugal partner, not a decision about a child.
        - [ ] No, Julian can only appeal a negative decision about his eligibility to be a sponsor. Since he was approved to be a sponsor for David, he is not able to appeal to the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD).
        - [x] Yes, Julian can appeal the decision to the IAD. **An application that is refused due to the failure of a sponsor to meet the requirements for sponsorship may be appealed to the IAD.**
        - [ ] Yes, Julian can appeal the decision to the IAD on the basis that he is a Canadian citizen and therefore has every right and entitlement to appeal any decision on an application he makes to IRCC.
        > Under section **62(1)** of the IRPA, a member of the family class may appeal to the IAD. Under section **65**, H&C considerations can be considered by the IAD. All other answers are incorrect.

    15. Which of the following is not one of the excluded relationships under Regulation 117(d) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR) and therefore is **still eligible** to be included to be sponsored to Canada?
        - [ ] A spouse, common law partner, or conjugal partner being sponsored by someone who has an existing sponsorship undertaking for another spouse or partner that has not ended.
        - [ ] A foreign national who is already married to another spouse when they married the sponsor.
        - [ ] A spouse or common law partner who is under 18 years of age.
        - [x] A spouse or common law partner who **entered a period of separation** with their sponsor at any time during their relationship.

    16. Aram came to Canada as a government-assisted refugee in 2017. Two weeks before he was set to travel to Canada, he married his partner, Samar. He was worried that if he disclosed this information to Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) he might get into trouble, and he would not be allowed to resettle to Canada, so he did not tell anyone about his new wife. In 2018 Aram filed an application to sponsor his wife under the Family Class and was denied because he had not previously disclosed his relationship. Can Aram apply to sponsor his wife under the new IRCC public policy to avoid the application of provisions 117(9)(d) and 125(1)(d) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR)?
        - [ ] No, Aram will not be permitted to apply under the public policy as he knowingly did not disclose his wife to IRCC when he became a permanent resident.
        - [x] Yes, Aram will be permitted to apply to sponsor his wife in accordance with the **IRCC public policy** to avoid the application of provisions 117(9)(d) and 125(1)(d) of the IRPR.
        - [ ] No, the only way that Aram would be able to sponsor his previously undisclosed wife would be to ask for consideration on Humanitarian and Compassionate grounds under section 25(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).
        - [ ] No, Aram would have to show that he did not intentionally avoid disclosing his wife to IRCC when he did not disclose his spouse in order to take advantage of the IRCC public policy to avoid the application of provision 117(9)(d) and 125(1)(d) of the IRPR.

    17. According to Section 130(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR), what are the eligibility requirements for an individual to sponsor a foreign national under the family class or spouse or common-law partner in Canada class?
        - [ ] The sponsor must be a permanent resident, at least 18 years of age, residing in Canada, and have filed a sponsorship application in the past two years.
        - [ ] The sponsor can be any individual regardless of citizenship or age,residing in Canada, and must have filed a sponsorship application.
        - [ ] The sponsor must be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident, at least 21 years of age, residing in Canada, and have filed a sponsorship application.
        - [x] The sponsor must be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident, at least 18 years of age, residing in Canada, and have filed a sponsorship application.
        > The correct answer reflects the eligibility criteria outlined in Section **130(1)** of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, which specifies that a sponsor must be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident, at least 18 years of age, residing in Canada, and have filed a sponsorship application.

    18. Matthew wishes to sponsor his wife and two youngest children to join him in Canada. He has an older daughter, Courtney, who is 19 years old and is studying at university to become a doctor. She does not wish to join Matthew in Canada with the rest of her family, because she wants to complete her education in her home country and become a doctor there. When filling out the application, Matthew is confused as to whether he should still list Courtney or not in the application forms. What would you advise Matthew in this situation?
        - [ ] Because Courtney is choosing to remain in her home country of her own free will she does not need to be included on Matthew's forms. She only needs to include dependent family members who will be processed to join him in Canada through the sponsorship.
        - [ ] Matthew can choose to list Courtney on his forms if he would like, but he isn't required to do so, and there will not be any immigration consequences if he leaves her out.
        - [ ] Because Courtney is over the age of 18, she does not need to be listed on Matthew's application forms.
        - [x] Matthew must list Courtney on the forms even though she does not wish to accompany him to Canada. All dependent family members must be listed in the application forms, whether they are accompanying the applicant to Canada or not.

    19. According to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR), a foreign national shall not be considered a spouse, a common-law partner, or a conjugal partner if the marriage, common-law partnership, or conjugal partnership is:
        - [x] solely for the purpose of acquiring any status or privilege under the Act.
        - [ ] a genuine relationship.
        - [ ] entered into without proper documentation.
        - [ ] primarily for financial gain.

    20. On January 13, 2023, Amber submitted an application from within Canada to be sponsored by her wife, Ingrid, who is a permanent resident. She received a notice from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada ("IRCC") that her application had been received, checked for completeness, and was now being reviewed by an immigration officer. On March 14, 2023, Amber learned that her wife, Ingrid, is now being investigated because IRCC believes that she obtained her own permanent residence through misrepresenting important facts about her work experience in her home country and she might not have been eligible for permanent residence at all. Amber is worried that this will impact her spousal sponsorship application. What should you advise Amber?
        - [x] Sponsorship applications can be suspended if proceedings are brought against the sponsor or co-signer that challenge the validity of the sponsor's own immigration status for matters such as misrepresentation.
        - [ ] Sponsorship applications can only be suspended if proceedings are brought against the sponsor or co-signer for serious matters involving criminality.
        - [ ] Sponsorship applications can only be suspended if proceedings are brought against the sponsor or co-signer for financial reasons.
        - [ ] Once sponsorship applications have been received by IRCC they cannot be suspended until a final decision on the application has been rendered.
        > Under **R136(1)(b)**, ==if the sponsor is the subject of an inadmissibility report, the sponsorship application may be suspended==. All other answers are incorrect.
