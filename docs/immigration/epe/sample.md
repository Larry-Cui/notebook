Min-kyu tells her that he has been in the business for six years, and has $900,000 in net worth. Since Min-kyu must continue to manage the cash flow and operations of his existing bars, he plans to make an initial investment of $100,000 in his proposed new bars at the end of his first year in Canada, with a follow-up investment of $200,000 at the end of his second and third years..
