**Bernadette** was designated as an irregular arrival when she arrived in Canada on February 14, 2024. She made a claim for protection, but the RPD rejected her claim on April 11, 2024. In these circumstances, Bernadette would not be able to make an H&C application until:

- [x] April 11, 2029
- [ ] March 17, 2029
- [ ] Bernadette can make an H&C application at any time.
- [ ] May 11, 2025
> A designated foreign national who has made a refugee claim at the RPD cannot make an H&C application until **five years** after the date of the designation, or five years after the decision on the designated foreign national's refugee claim, appeal of a rejected refugee claim, or application for PRRA.

**Doug** married **Felicia**, his high school sweetheart, in their hometown of Victoria, British Columbia on June 22, 2014, but the couple has been living separate and apart since September 21, 2017. Under the terms of their separation agreement, they share joint custody of their nine-year-old daughter, **Mia**, and Doug makes monthly child support payments. In early 2018, Doug accepted a contract to work for a Canadian company in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where he began a relationship with **Yau**, and the two have lived together since **May 2, 2018**. In these circumstances, which of the following is true?

- [ ] Doug cannot sponsor Yau because he and Felicia are not divorced.
- [ ] Doug can sponsor Yau as a spouse.
- [x] Doug can sponsor Yau as a common law partner.
- [ ] Doug cannot sponsor Yau because he is making child support payments to Felicia under their separation agreement.
> Doug can sponsor Yau as a common law partner because they have been cohabiting in a conjugal relationship for more than one year. The sponsorship bar under IRPR r 130(3) does not apply to Doug because he was not initially a sponsored spouse, and their relationship is not excluded under IRPR r 117(9). 
> 
> The fact that Doug and Felicia are still married does not bar him from sponsoring Yau **since they have lived separate and apart for more than one year** (reference: IRCC Assessing a common law relationship).

**Albert** has been an immigration consultant since the 1990s. He utilizes a paper filing system as he is not fully comfortable using the computer. He shares his office with a friend **Larry**, who is a real estate agent, to save on rent and other overhead expenditures. They also share an open reception area to greet their clients. Which of the following is the most correct method for Albert to keep his clients' files organized and safe?

- [x] Labelling his files utilizing a numerical method and storing them in a fireproof locked filing cabinet.
- [ ] Labelling his files by date organized in chronological order in a locked file cabinet.
- [ ] Labelling his files utilizing an alphabetical method and storing them in banker boxes at the reception area.
- [ ] Labelling his files utilizing an alphabetical method and storing them in a file cabinet located in his office.
> The Client File Management Regulations require members to employ **a clear and coherent system to label and identify client property**. Albert can utilize a numerical labeling method to organize his clients' files. Furthermore, storing his clients' files in a fireproof locked filing cabinet complies with the requirement to **store client records in a physically secure manner** as outlined in s 6.1 of the Client File Management Regulation. 
> 
> Labeling his files by date organized in chronological order in a locked file cabinet: this answer is incorrect. Labeling his clients' files by date only is not sufficient to clearly identify clients' property. Members are also required to store active files separately from closed files per s 5.4 of the Client File Management Regulations. 
> 
> Labeling his files utilizing an alphabetical method and storing them in banker boxes at the reception area: this answer is incorrect. Storing clients' files in banker boxes at the reception is not secure, as such area is open to the public and as a result is contrary to s 6.1 of the Client File Management Regulation. 
> 
> Labeling his files utilizing an alphabetical method and storing them in a file cabinet located in his office: this answer is incorrect. An unlocked file cabinet that is not fireproof is not secure, contrary to the criteria outlined in s 6.1 of the Client File Management Regulation.

**Albert** has been an immigration consultant since the 1990s. He is seeking to revamp his immigration practice and has hired **Olivia** to help him organize his files electronically. As part of this file organization process, Albert and Olivia come across several old files, including one file that was opened on June 20, 2008, and closed on October 16, 2019. Based on the criteria and timeline imposed by the Immigration Consultants of Canada Regulatory Council, may Albert destroy this file?

- [ ] Yes, as Albert was permitted to destroy it any time after June 21, 2016.
- [ ] Yes, as Albert was permitted to destroy it any time after it was closed.
- [x] No, he may not destroy it until October 17, 2025.
- [ ] No, he may not destroy it until October 17, 2029.
> According to s 7.2 of the Client File Management Regulation, "a Client File shall be retained in a secure and accessible location for a minimum of **six (6) years** after the File has been closed." As a result, Albert may destroy it after at least six years have passed from October 16, 2019.

**Dwayne** is a Canadian citizen who wants to sponsor his wife, **Matilda**, an Australian citizen whom he met on a backpacking trip in Tasmania. The two travelled together for nine months, and upon their return to her home city of Adelaide in 2015, married and bought a house together. This is both Dwayne and Matilda's first marriage. Dwayne retains the services of **Ronald**, an RCIC based in Canberra, to assist him in the sponsorship application.

- [ ] Proof of Dwayne's visits to Australia, including airline boarding passes or entry-exit stamps in their passport.
> IMM 5533 E Document Checklist sets out the requirements for evidence of proof of relationship to the sponsor. Dwayne and Matilda live together, have been married for at least two years, and have not been married previously, but **since they do not have a child together, they will be required to submit photos showing their relationship as proof of their relationship**. 
> 
> **Since they live together, they will not be required to provide copies of their correspondence, proof of visits, or an explanation of why they have not visited each other.** Reference: IMM 5533E Document Checklist, Spouse (Including Dependent Children).

- [ ] The sponsored relative must not have a spouse or a common law or conjugal partner.
- [ ] The sponsor is related by blood or adoption to the sponsored relative.
- [x] The sponsor does not have any other family members who are Canadian citizens or permanent residents.
> To sponsor a relative as a "**lonely family member**," **the sponsor must not have any other family members who are Canadian citizens or permanent residents**. This is not a requirement to be sponsored as an "orphaned relative." Reference: IRPR r 117(1)(f) and IRCC.

**Charlie** is an international student who is about to complete an **18-month** full-time IT diploma program at the Southern Alberta Institute of Technology (SAIT). Charlie would like to stay in Calgary longer to develop relevant work experience, with a view to possibly seeking permanent residence under the Canadian Experience Class. He retains **Barbara**, an RCIC, who tells him that he should apply for a Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP). 

Barbara may advise Charlie of all of the following with regard to his application for a PGWP **except**:

- [ ] He must apply for the Post-Graduation Work Permit Program (PGWPP) within 180 days of completing his program.
- [ ] Employers seeking to hire him under the PGWPP will be exempt from the LMIA requirement.
- [x] The PGWP will be valid for three years.
- [ ] He must obtain written notification from SAIT indicating that he has completed his program of study.
> Since the length of Charlie's study program was more than eight months and less than two years, his PGWP may only be valid for up to the length of his study program (18 months). A PGWP may be valid for three years only when the applicant's study program lasts for two years or more, or in certain cases when the study program is a master's or doctoral program.

- [x] Ester can stay in Canada for travel purposes until October 13, 2024.
- [ ] Ester can stay in Canada for travel purposes until December 30, 2024.
- [ ] Ester must leave Canada immediately after she graduates.
- [ ] Ester can only stay in Canada beyond her graduation date if she applies for a temporary resident visa in Canada.
> Ester can stay in Canada until 90 days after the day on which she completes her studies.

**Namir** is the owner of a taco franchise in southwestern Ontario. He wants to hire additional staff to assist him in the franchise's expansion across the province, and submits his job offer for prospective temporary foreign workers to Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC) in order to obtain an LMIA. In assessing his job offer, the ESDC may consider each of the following factors, **except**:

- [ ] Whether Namir made reasonable efforts to recruit or hire Canadian citizens or permanent residents before offering the job to a foreign worker.
- [x] Whether the temporary foreign workers are likely to be found inadmissible.
- [ ] Whether the temporary foreign workers are likely to fill a labour shortage in Canada.
- [ ] Whether the employment of a temporary foreign worker will result in job creation or retention for Canadian citizens or permanent residents.
> ESDC's role is to review a job offer's proposed working conditions, the availability of Canadian or permanent residents to do the work, the skills and knowledge transfer, and the job creation for the benefit of Canadian or permanent residents that may result from hiring a temporary foreign worker. Assessing an applicant's admissibility is outside the scope of ESDC's duties (i.e., it is the responsibility of IRCC). Reference: IRPR, r 203(3).

**Knut** is a Norwegian citizen who came to Canada as a permanent resident under the Federal Skilled Trades class. Knut had been dating **Marit** for three months before he moved to St. John's, Newfoundland, and then they carried on a long-distance relationship. Knut has now been working in Canada for three years, and during this time, he has gone back to Oslo each year to stay with Marit for his two months of vacation. Marit had previously been unable to leave Norway because she was studying full-time to obtain her bachelor's degree in geosciences; however, since graduating earlier this year, she has been discussing the possibility of joining Knut in Canada, and they plan on becoming engaged in the very near future. 

Which of the following is true in these circumstances?

- [ ] Knut can sponsor Marit as a conjugal partner.
- [ ] Knut can sponsor Marit as a common law partner.
- [ ] Knut can sponsor Marit as a fiancé if they marry within 90 days of her arriving in Canada.
- [x] Knut can sponsor Marit as a spouse if they get married.
> **Knut and Marit would not be considered conjugal partners because there were no immigration barriers that have prevented them from living together.** Knut and Marit do not meet the definition of common law partners because they have not cohabited continuously for a period of at least one year. There are no provisions in the IRPA or IRPR that allow for the sponsorship of a fiancé as described. Reference: IRCC Guide 5289, Assessing Conjugal Relationships.

**Adel**, a chemical engineer, became a permanent resident **six years ago**. He hopes to obtain Canadian citizenship, but has needed to divide his time between Canada and his home country of Nigeria. The reason is that his employer, a Canadian oil company, moves him between Fort McMurray and Nigeria on three-month rotations. He spends three months in Canada, then three months in Nigeria. He has therefore accumulated **six months (183 days) in Canada in each calendar year** for the past six years. 

Is Adel eligible for Canadian citizenship?

- [ ] Yes, because he has accumulated more than 730 days of physical presence in Canada in the past five years.
- [ ] Yes, because all of his time abroad was working on assignment for a Canadian company.
- [x] No, because he has not accumulated enough days in Canada.
- [ ] No, because, although he has enough days, his days are not continuous.
> He needs **1095 days of physical presence** in the past 5 years, and has only 915 days (183x5), per Citizenship Act, s 5(1)(c)(i). There is no requirement for the days to be continuous per Citizenship Act, s 5(1.001)(b). 730 days of physical presence in Canada in every five-year period is the requirement to keep PR, not qualify for citizenship. Working abroad for a Canadian company allows him to keep PR as well, but will not count towards citizenship under s. 5 of the Citizenship Act.

Ben currently works as a marketing coordinator and has had an annual income of $42,000 for the past three years, while Xiao Wen works as a financial advisor at a bank and has had an annual income of $48,000 for the past three years. Assuming that Ben and Xiao Wen applied to sponsor Xiao Wen's parents in 2024, which of the following is true?

- [ ] Xiao Wen meets the financial requirements to sponsor her parents.
- [ ] The couple do not meet the financial requirements to sponsor Xiao Wen's parents.
- [x] The couple meets the financial requirements if Ben and Xiao Wen apply to co-sponsor Xiao Wen's parents.
- [ ] Ben meets the financial requirements to sponsor Xiao Wen's parents.
> The minimum necessary income requirement for sponsoring parents and grandparents (which is generally based on the **LICO + 30%**) must be met in each of the **three consecutive years** preceding the date of the application. 
> 
> If applying in 2024, sponsorship applicants must provide proof of income from the CRA for the taxation years of 2023, 2022, and 2021. See LICO for Parents and Grandparents sponsorship, family of four = $64,466 in 2023, $64,306 in 2022, and $49,106 in 2021. Reference: IRCC Help Centre.

**Henry** is a Canadian citizen who works as a freelance photographer. While on a trip to Cambodia to photograph the ruins at Angkor Wat, he met **Raina**, a tourist from New Zealand. Henry followed Raina back to her home in Wellington, New Zealand, where he met **Pika**, Raina's four-year-old daughter from a previous relationship. The couple fell in love over the seven months that Henry stayed in New Zealand, and he proposed to Raina at the top of Mt. Kaukau. Henry has retained **Brian**, an RCIC in Wellington, to begin the process of applying to sponsor Raina and Pika for permanent residence. Henry asks Brian if he meets the financial requirements, because his income as a freelance photographer can be unpredictable, and he has had an average annual income of only $16,000 in the past two years because of his travels. Brian should advise Henry that:

- [ ] He meets the financial requirements for sponsorship because his income will be greater when he is not travelling.
- [ ] He can sponsor Raina and Pika provided that Raina and Henry can show combined funds of $42,110.
- [x] The financial requirements for sponsorship do not apply in these circumstances.
- [ ] He cannot sponsor Raina and Pika because he does not meet the financial requirements.
> There is an exception to the income requirements where the sponsor is applying to sponsor a foreign national who is **a spouse and the dependent child of that spouse**, provided that the dependent child does not have a dependent child (IRPR, r 133(4)(b)). Reference: IRCC Guide IMM 5482.


!!! note "Case"

    **Jay Pham**, 52, has been a naturalized citizen of Canada for many years, operating a successful Vietnamese restaurant in Edmonton. His wife immigrated with him 20 years ago, but they are now divorced. He recently got re-married to **Mai**, a 22-year-old citizen of Vietnam who he met through her relatives in Edmonton. Jay travelled to Vietnam for the wedding and a second time to visit her. He occasionally sends money for her support. After interviewing Mai, the visa officer found the marriage was not genuine, but was entered into solely to gain immigration status in Canada. Jay has filed an appeal to the IAD. While waiting for the appeal hearing, Mai gives birth to their child. 

<i class="fa-solid fa-1 number"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-7 number"></i>

Does Jay have a right to introduce evidence of the baby's birth at the appeal hearing?

- [ ] No, because the IAD can only consider evidence which was before the officer when the decision was made.
- [x] Yes, because the IAD can consider new evidence that arose after the refusal.
- [ ] No, Jay has no right to introduce the new evidence, but the panel member has discretion to allow it.
- [ ] No, because the matter involves a possible fraudulent marriage, so the birth is not relevant.
> An IAD hearing is an appeal ***de novo***, meaning that the facts and law will be re-considered and assessed at the time the appeal is disposed of; thus, new evidence is admissible. This is the opposite of the rule for judicial review in Federal Court, where only evidence that was before the officer when the decision was made can be considered by the court. As the appellant has a right to prove the facts as they exist at the time of the hearing, he can introduce any new evidence that arose after the officer's refusal. He need not rely on the panel member's discretion in this regard. A baby is very relevant to genuineness of a marriage and would be a significant, although not determinative, factor. References: IRPA s 67(1), ENF 19.

<i class="fa-solid fa-1 number"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-8 number"></i>

♥️

At the appeal hearing, the visa officer's decision will be set aside if:

- [ ] The officer's decision was not reasonable.
- [x] There was a breach of natural justice.
- [ ] Insufficient reasons were provided for the decision.
- [ ] The IAD panel member disagrees with the officer's decision.
> **The test is correctness in fact and law, or mixed fact and law, or a breach of natural justice.** Reference: IRPA s 67(1). 
> 
> Reasonableness would be the test for determining the genuineness of a marriage on judicial review, not at the IAD. Insufficient reasons will not generally constitute a breach of natural justice, so some other breach would need to be relied on, for example, if the officer refused to allow Mai to have a translator at the interview. 
> 
> Whether the IAD panel member disagrees with the officer's decision is not relevant unless grounds under IRPA s 67(1) are found.

<i class="fa-solid fa-1 number"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-9 number"></i>

If **Jay** seeks an adjournment of the hearing due to his wife's health, the requirements of natural justice would mean that:

- [ ] Jay has a right to obtain an adjournment provided he has legitimate reasons.
- [ ] An adjournment would only be granted by the IAD panel member where the Minister's counsel was in agreement.
- [ ] Jay has the right to request an adjournment from the Minister's counsel; any agreement between them is binding on the panel.
- [x] The IAD panel member would consider a request for an adjournment made in accordance with the rules, and exercise their discretion.
> Natural justice does not dictate any specific result, but goes to the process of decision-making that is fair to both parties. The request is made to the panel as the decision-maker, not to the Minister's counsel. Jay's reasons may be legitimate, but other operational factors are also taken into account, such as availability of hearing officers. The IRB notes that postponement requests are granted only in exceptional circumstances. The panel member must be fair to both parties in rendering the decision, but there is no requirement that the parties agree. Reference: IRB.

<i class="fa-solid fa-2 number"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-0 number"></i>

If **Jay** loses at the IAD and wishes to apply to the Federal Court for judicial review, the standard of review the judge will apply is:

- [ ] Whether the IAD panel member's decision that the marriage was not genuine was correct, based on the facts and the law.
- [ ] Whether the visa officer's decision that the marriage was not genuine was correct, based on the facts and the law.
- [x] Whether the IAD panel member's decision that the marriage was not genuine was reasonable.
- [ ] Whether the visa officer's decision that the marriage was not genuine was reasonable.
> The matter of whether a marriage is genuine is a question of fact. If the IAD's decision on the genuineness of a marriage is challenged in Federal Court, **the standard of judicial review applicable is reasonableness**—i.e., whether the IAD decision was reasonable. Reference: *Kehn v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)*, 2020 FC 615. To decide whether the decision was reasonable, the court will enquire into "the existence of justification, transparency and intelligibility within the decision-making process and ... whether the decision falls within a range of possible, acceptable outcomes which are defensible in respect of the facts and the law." Reference: *Dunsmuir v New Brunswick*, 2008 SCC 9, [2008] 1 SCR 190, at para 47.

**Sophie** became a Canadian permanent resident on **March 20, 2021**, after being co-sponsored by her son, Frank, and his wife, Beth, both Canadian citizens. A few months after Sophie arrived, her relationship with her son and daughter-in-law deteriorated, with Sophie frequently expressing her disapproval of the way the couple conducted their lives. Sophie eventually moved out of her son's home in September 2024, and had to go on social assistance for several months. Fortunately, she found a job as a customer service representative three months later and has been employed since. Who would be responsible for paying back the government for the social assistance that Sophie received?

- [ ] Sophie, because she now has the ability to repay.
- [ ] Frank and Sophie will be jointly liable.
- [ ] Sophie, because she moved out of Frank and Beth's house.
- [x] Frank and Beth will be jointly liable.
> Sponsors and co-sponsors are obligated to reimburse the government of Canada or a province for any social assistance provided to the sponsored foreign national for the duration of their undertaking. Beth and Frank's undertaking to support Sophie has not yet expired because **20 years** have not elapsed from the date she became a permanent resident (IRPR, r 132(1)).

**Elisa** came to Saskatoon, Saskatchewan on a work permit that authorized her to work for a specific employer. She has been in Saskatoon for one year and would like to apply for an extension of her work permit because she really enjoys her job. Unfortunately, she forgot to send in the application for renewal to a case processing centre until **four months after** her work permit expired. In order to remain in Canada in these circumstances, Elisa could apply for:

- [ ] An extension of status.
- [x] Elisa cannot remain in Canada in these circumstances.
- [ ] A temporary resident permit.
- [ ] Restoration of status.
> Elisa cannot apply for an extension of status because her work permit has expired. She is not able to apply for a restoration of status because she **continues to engage in unauthorized work** and because **more than 90 days have passed since losing her status**. A temporary resident permit may be granted in exceptional circumstances to a person who does not meet the eligibility and/or admissibility requirements to remain temporarily in Canada (IRPA, s 24(2)). In this case, Elisa's circumstances would not be considered exceptional enough to warrant a TRP.

Most refugee claimants are eligible to have their claim referred to the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) for a determination of their claim on its merits. However, in some very specific situations, which are set out in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, a claim will not be referred to the RPD. Which one of the following claims is **not eligible to be referred** to the RPD?

- [ ] Flora made a previous refugee claim in France, but the claim was rejected.
- [ ] Viggo is a citizen of Norway, which is a Designated Country of Origin whose citizens are ineligible to be referred to the RPD.
- [x] Elias made an earlier claim which he had to abandon for medical reasons beyond his control but is still in Canada.
- [ ] Annie is an American citizen who fears for her life at the hands of her abusive husband, who is high up in a law enforcement agency and is misusing his authority to stalk her.
> The bars to having a claim referred to the RPD are set out in **s 101(1)** of the IRPA. 
> 
> Where the claimant abandoned an earlier claim after it was referred to the RPD, a new claim will not be eligible: IRPA, s 101(1)(c). **There are no exceptions**, such as the reason for abandonment or continued presence in Canada. (There is a narrow window under the RPD Rules to try to re-open the original claim, but the new claim is still ineligible). 
> 
> A new claim will be eligible where the prior rejection occurred in another country, as the bar in IRPA, **s 101(1)(b)** only applies where the **prior rejection was by the IRB**. 
> 
> **The Safe Third Country Agreement will bar many claims made at the USA-Canada border, but not where the claimant is an American citizen**, see IRPA, s 101(1)(e). Note that the Safe Third Country Agreement was recently challenged in court but was upheld by the Supreme Court of Canada in June 2023. As of this update in December 2024, the Safe Third Country Agreement remains in effect. The DCO list was abolished effective May 10, 2019; even when it existed, it affected time frames and some rights but not eligibility for referral, per se.

Xian is a world-renowned scientist, and has just been offered a five-year contract with NASA in Houston. If she takes the job, Carl plans to go with her. She consults with you regarding her concerns over any potential loss of PR, and how she might renew her PR card in five years. 

<i class="fa-solid fa-2 number"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-5 number"></i>

Is Xian likely able to keep her Canadian PR status?

- [ ] No, once she lives outside Canada for more than three years.
- [x] Yes, because her spouse is a Canadian citizen and they will be living together.
- [ ] No, because under IRPA s 28(2)(a)(ii), she is not accompanying her husband since her job is the reason for the move; he is accompanying her.
- [ ] Yes, because her work is of enough importance that she is likely to keep her residency on H&C grounds.
> IRCC policy is that s 28(2)(a)(ii) applies as long as the spouses co-habit together abroad. **It does not matter who accompanies whom.** Reference: IRCC ENF 23 s 7.5. As she can keep her PR, there is no need to rely on H&C grounds; in any case, H&C considerations cannot generally overcome a breach of the residency obligation due to work-related choices. References: IRPA s 28(2)(a)(ii), IRPR r 61(4).

<i class="fa-solid fa-2 number"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-6 number"></i>

Can Xian renew her PR card while in the US?

- [ ] Yes, she can apply to the Canadian Consulate in US, assuming she qualifies under IRPA s 28(2)(a)(ii).
- [x] No, because physical presence in Canada is required to obtain a new PR card.
- [ ] Yes, if she applies by mail to CPC-Sydney, giving them her US mailing address.
- [ ] Only if she applies to renew the PR card on H&C grounds.
> IRCC policies are that the **renewal application can only be made in Canada** to the office in Sydney, NS. The applicant must be physically present in Canada, and the card will only be mailed to a Canadian address. Reference: IRCC.

<i class="fa-solid fa-2 number"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-7 number"></i>

If Xian appears at a Canadian land border with an expired PR card, the CBSA officer has the option to:

- [ ] Refuse her entry if she cannot demonstrate she met the PR obligation.
- [ ] Allow her entry as a PR with an order to apply for the new PR card in 30 days.
- [ ] Treat her as a temporary resident and allow her entry as a visitor.
- [x] Write an IRPA s 44 report for non-compliance, but allow her entry to appeal.
> Per IRPA s 27, **a PR has a right to enter Canada even if their card has expired**. Xian is still a PR until that status is officially terminated, which has not happened yet. A border officer may make a determination that she has not complied with the residency obligation and prepare a report under IRPA s 44, but **an appeal to the IAD is afforded by law and she will be permitted entry for that**, although **her days in Canada after the IRPA s 44 report will not count towards meeting the residency obligation** unless she is subsequently determined to have complied with the obligation. Reference: IRCC ENF 23 Loss of permanent resident status, s 7.2. There is no legal authority for the officer to treat her as a visitor, or make an order to apply for the PR card in a certain time period. Reference: IRCC ENF 4 Port of Entry Examinations, s 11.13.

<i class="fa-solid fa-2 number"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-8 number"></i>

If an officer outside Canada ever did take away Xian's PR status for failing to meet the residency obligation, she would have a right to appeal. She has **a right to attend the IAD appeal hearing** in person if:

- [ ] She was in Canada for at least 730 days in the past five years.
- [ ] Her reasons for wanting to attend in person are compelling.
- [x] She was in Canada for **at least one day in the past 365 days**.
- [ ] The officer has made the determination that sufficient H&C grounds exist to overcome the failure to meet the residency obligation.
> Physical presence in Canada for at least one day in the year before the examination is the only factor that triggers the right to be given a travel document to attend the residency appeal hearing in person: IRPA s 31(3)(c). If she had accumulated 730 days, or an officer made a positive H&C decision, her PR status would continue so there would be no need to appeal. Compelling reasons to want to attend in person can be put forth for a discretionary decision by the IAD panel, but do not give her a right to attend.

**Yujin** is an avid soccer fan who plays in several amateur leagues in South Korea. She would like to obtain a temporary resident visa to attend a tournament with her team, the Seoul Tigers, in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan in **March 2025**. However, she was convicted of assault in June 2018, following a drunken brawl while watching the World Cup in her local bar. She was sentenced to two years' probation and required to attend anger management counselling and do community service, which she completed in **November 2020**. Will Yujin be able to obtain a temporary resident visa to attend the tournament in March 2025?

- [x] No, because she is eligible to apply for individual rehabilitation in November 2025, which is after the tournament.
- [ ] Yes, because she was deemed rehabilitated in July 2023.
- [ ] Yes, she can apply for individual rehabilitation because five years have elapsed since her conviction.
- [ ] No, because she is not eligible to apply for individual rehabilitation until November 2030, which is after the tournament.

**Than** was adopted from Myanmar by a Canadian couple when he was two years old. He grew up with his adoptive family in Newmarket, Ontario, and is now 26 years old. Last year, Than was able to find his biological mother through a website for adopted orphans operated by an international NGO. Than recently reconnected with her during a one-month trip to Yangon and, through an interpreter, he learned of the tragic circumstances that led his mother to leave him at an orphanage during the Burmese civil war. She does not have any family members who survived the war, and currently works as a maid in a hotel. Can Than apply to sponsor his biological mother for permanent residence?

- [x] No, because she is not eligible as a member of the family class.
- [ ] Yes, provided that evidence proving that she is his biological mother is submitted.
- [ ] No, unless his adoptive parents consent.
- [ ] Yes, because he does not have any other biological relatives in Canada.

    **Mandeep** is a 36-year-old woman who is a citizen of India and of no other country. Just over a decade ago, she completed a graduate degree in Germany and obtained permanent resident status in that country. She then returned to India, and a year later, she married **Vijay**, a local entrepreneur. Vijay was an abusive partner, and he physically and sexually abused Mandeep on a regular basis. 
    
    Last year, Mandeep travelled to Calgary to visit her cousins. During her trip, she disclosed her situation to a trusted family member who then persuaded her to stay in Canada. Mandeep consulted **Anahita**, an RCIC who works at a local immigration firm. After advising Mandeep of her options, Anahita made the recommendation that Mandeep should file a refugee claim. 
    
    In February, Mandeep made a refugee application on the basis that she fears gender-related persecution. Mandeep did not disclose the fact that she has permanent resident status in Germany because she did not think it was relevant to her claim. 
    
    As Anahita prepares Mandeep for the hearing, it becomes quickly obvious that the domestic abuse was extremely traumatic for Mandeep and that she is under a tremendous amount of stress. As a result, Mandeep is having difficulty remembering the details of events that occurred in India. Anahita is very worried her claim will be refused because of this issue. 

<i class="fa-solid fa-3 number"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-9 number"></i>

Which of the following can Anahita **not** do in preparing Mandeep to testify at the RPD hearing?

- [ ] Explain to her that you may be able to change the order of questioning to better accommodate her situation.
- [ ] Advise her to pick one version of events (the version detailed in her BOC) and to stick with it.
- [ ] Advise her to say that she "does not remember" when she is asked about details that she does not remember.
- [x] Advise her she can refer the RPD to her BOC or a corroborating document, if she thinks the correct details are listed there that she does not remember.
> Many refugee claimants who have experienced trauma suffer from PTSD and have difficulty remembering certain events, details, and even dates. While it is important to provide testimony that is consistent with the documentary evidence (including the BOC), you must advise your client to answer questions candidly and honestly. If your client does not remember something, it's best to say that she does not remember or refer the RPD to her BOC or another corroborating document.

If the RPD renders a decision to allow Mandeep's claim for refugee protection, which of the following is true?

- [x] The Minister can apply to the RPD to vacate the decision, and if the application is allowed, Mandeep will lose her refugee status.
- [ ] The RPD may review the decision and determine the claim is manifestly unfounded.
- [ ] The RPD may review the decision and determine the claim has no credible basis.
- [ ] The Minister can apply to the RPD to vacate the decision, and if the application is allowed, Mandeep will have to appeal to the RAD.
> Mandeep withheld the fact that she has PR status in Germany. The RPD may, on application by the Minister, vacate a decision to allow a claim for refugee protection, if it finds that the decision was obtained as a result of directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter (IRPA **s 109(1)**). If the application is allowed, refugee status is lost (IRPA s 109(3)).

- [ ] Caring for Children Pathway.
- [ ] Live-In Caregiver Program.
- [ ] Home Child Care Provider Pilot.
- [x] None of the above

**Huang** is a Canadian **permanent resident** who works for a Canadian company in Beijing, China, where he is on a two-year work transfer. Eight months after his arrival in Beijing, Huang married **Shu Pei**, and the couple live together in Beijing. Shu Pei is eager to go to Canada because she wants to start graduate studies at a Canadian university, but Huang is unable to return until he completes his work placement. In these circumstances:

- [ ] Huang can submit the sponsorship application in Beijing, and Shu Pei can enter Canada as a permanent resident before he returns to Canada.
- [x] Huang cannot submit the sponsorship application at this time because he is not residing in Canada.
- [ ] Huang can submit the sponsorship application in Beijing, but Shu Pei cannot enter Canada as a permanent resident unless Huang accompanies her.
- [ ] Huang cannot submit a sponsorship application at this time because he has not been married for over one year.
> There are no provisions in the IRPA or IRPR that allow a permanent resident to sponsor a foreign national while they are living abroad. IRPR r 130(2) applies only to Canadian citizens living abroad.

**Klaus** is a librarian from Germany who is interested in immigrating to Canada under the **Federal Skilled Worker** Program. He found a qualifying job offer with a company in Kingston, Ontario, and completed an Express Entry profile with a CRS score of 539 points. He received an Invitation to Apply (ITA) during the most recent round of invitations; in that round, the lowest score was 442 points. He has retained **Hanna**, an RCIC in Berlin, to assist him in completing his application. However, before he could submit his application, his job offer was revoked when his potential employer went out of business. Klaus is confident that he can secure another job offer in Canada, and he has already conducted two promising phone interviews. 

What advice should Hanna give Klaus?

- [x] Klaus must submit his application within 60 days of receiving the ITA.
- [ ] Klaus may wait to submit his application until after he receives another job offer.
- [ ] Klaus should decline the ITA, as he no longer possesses the required CRS score.
- [ ] Klaus should decline the ITA, as the FSWP requires him to have arranged employment in Canada.
> Klaus may submit his application despite losing his job offer as long as he continues to meet the Federal Skilled Workers selection criteria and as long as his recalculated CRS score is higher than the lowest CRS score in his round of invitations. 
> 
> Without his job offer, Klaus' CRS score is 489, which is higher than the lowest score in his round. **It is not a requirement of the FSWP that Klaus have arranged employment in Canada.** References: Federal skilled workers selection criteria; 
> 
> Express Entry: Assessing an electronic application on section A11.2. Klaus must submit his application **within 60 days of receiving an ITA**.

!!! note "Case"

    **Yuling** is a citizen of China and of no other country. Yuling is 44 years old and has a 17-year-old daughter, **Mei**. In 2011, Yuling began practicing Falun Gong, and over the course of several years, Yuling and Mei received numerous threats from authorities as a result of her spiritual practice. Last year, Yuling and other Falun Gong practitioners led a small protest against the government. Yuling was detained at the protest and sent to a forced labour camp. After six months of being in detention, Yuling managed to escape the labour camp. In her escape, she injured a security guard and left him paralyzed. Fearing for her and Mei's safety, she decided to flee the country with her daughter. She quickly sought out the help of a smuggler to assist them in obtaining false documents and arranging transit to Canada. After a difficult and roundabout journey, Yuling and Mei arrived at the Toronto airport with several other Chinese citizens who were also seeking asylum. Upon arrival, Yuling, Mei, and the others were **designated as irregular arrivals**. 


<i class="fa-solid fa-5 number"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-8 number"></i>

♥️

Which of the following is true?

- [ ] Yuling will be automatically detained.
- [ ] Yuling and Mei will not be eligible to make a refugee claim.
- [x] Yuling and Mei will be automatically detained.
- [ ] Yuling and Mei will be eligible to make a refugee claim in 12 months.
> Yuling and Mei will be subject to automatic detention (IRPA s 55(3.1)(a)) because they are designated foreign nationals (DFNs). **Any DFN 16 years of age or older is automatically detained** on their entry into Canada. Being DFNs does not preclude them from making a refugee claim, and there is no 12-month bar.

<i class="fa-solid fa-5 number"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-9 number"></i>

If Yuling and Mei's refugee claim is heard, which of the following is an issue that is likely to be raised by the RPD during the hearing?

- [ ] The availability of state protection.
- [ ] Nexus to one of the five Convention grounds.
- [x] Exclusion based on Article 1F(b).
- [ ] The use of false documents to enter Canada.
> Exclusion based on Article 1F(b) is correct. A refugee claimant will be excluded under **Article 1F(b)** and IRPA s 98 if it is determined that she committed a **serious non-political crime** outside the country of refuge. There is a presumption of "seriousness" if the crime involves wounding, homicide, etc. (see Febles). In assessing the seriousness of the crime, the RPD also has to evaluate the facts, any mitigating/aggravating circumstances, etc. (see Jayasekara). Here the RPD would have to determine if the crime was serious and if it was non-political (see Febles for "non-political" test). See also: IRB. 
> 
> It is not correct that the availability of state protection is likely to be raised by the RPD. In Yuling's case, the state is the persecutory agent and therefore state protection is not available. 
> 
> It is not necessary to demonstrate that Yuling tried to obtain state protection since it would not have been reasonably forthcoming. Yuling and Mei's fear of persecution is by reason of membership in a particular social group (1 of 5 Convention grounds). 
> 
> A person who has claimed refugee protection may not be charged for possessing and using a fraudulent document to enter Canada (IRPA s 122, 133).

<i class="fa-solid fa-6 number"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-0 number"></i>

If Yuling and Mei proceed with a joint refugee claim, which of the following is true?

- [ ] A designated representative for Mei will be appointed because she is under 18.
- [ ] No designated representative for Mei will be appointed because she is over 16.
- [ ] Mei can choose to not attend the hearing since she is under 18.
- [ ] Mei must attend the hearing because she is over 12 years old.
> **Mei must ==attend== the hearing because she is over ==12== years old.** The IRB stipulates that children over 12 years of age who are also claiming refugee protection must attend the hearing ( IRB). It is not correct that a designated representative will be appointed for Mei or that Mei can choose not to attend the hearing. In this case, Mei and Yuling's claims would automatically be joined (Refugee Protection Division Rules, 55(1)). 
> 
> **Normally a ==designated representative== would be necessary if claimant is under ==18==** (not under 16), but in this case no designated representative is needed because her claim is joined with her parent's (Refugee Protection Division Rules, 20(2)).
