**Harvey** wants to make a complaint against **Sarah**, an RCIC that he had previously retained to assist him in applying for a permanent resident visa under the Federal Skilled Trades class. Harvey believes that Sarah was incompetent in her service because she was frequently non-communicative with him, failed to keep scheduled appointments, and appeared intoxicated at some of the meetings that she did attend. Upon receiving Harvey's complaint and assigning a member to conduct an investigation, the Complaints Committee may do each of the following, **except**:

- [ ] Refer the complaint for further investigation.
- [ ] Make an urgent motion to the Discipline and Fitness to Practice Committee.
- [x] Suspend Sarah's license until their investigation is complete.
- [ ] Close the complaint if the issue is low risk and does not present concerns about professional conduct.
> Upon receiving a complaint about one of its members, the Complaints Committee may make an urgent motion to the Discipline and Fitness to Practice Committees, refer the complaint for investigation, or initiate the early resolution process, which may include closing the complaint if the issue is low risk and there are no concerns about professional conduct. 
> 
> The Complaints Committee may caution the licensee or recommend that the licensee take remedial training courses, but **the Complaints Committee is not authorized to suspend the membership of a CICC member; that is within the purview of the Discipline Committee or the Fitness to Practice Committee.** Reference: CICC: Complaints Process.

<u>Marta</u> made a refugee claim at an IRCC inland office, which was referred to the RPD. Before the hearing of her claim, <u>Marta</u> speaks with Hiro, an RCIC, and decides that she wants to make an H&C application because she thinks that it offers her a better chance of staying in Canada. In these circumstances, Hiro should advise <u>Marta</u> that:

- [x] She must withdraw her refugee claim before an H&C application can be considered.
- [ ] Her refugee claim and H&C application can be considered concurrently.
- [ ] She cannot make an H&C application until one year after her claim was referred to the RPD.
- [ ] She cannot make an H&C application until her refugee claim is decided.

!!! note "Case"

    Salma, a pharmacist and single parent from Egypt, was landed as a permanent resident nine years ago in the Federal Skilled Worker Class. Her 17-year-old daughter Mariam accompanied her. After living in Canada for four years, Salma did not enjoy Canada, and decided to return to Cairo and her former employment there. She has not returned to Canada since. Meanwhile, Mariam stayed on, graduated from university, became a Canadian citizen, married, and now has a daughter of her own. Nine years have passed since Salma was landed and she desperately wants to come to Canada to visit her granddaughter. 


<i class="fa-solid fa-3 number"></i>

What is Salma's current immigration status in Canada?

- [ ] She has lost her PR status automatically under IRPA s 28 because she has been outside Canada too long.
- [ ] She lost her PR status when her PR card expired because she did not apply to renew it, regardless if she was inside or outside Canada.
- [ ] She is a citizen as she accumulated more than enough days of physical presence in Canada in her first five years.
- [x] She is still a permanent resident.
> Salma is still a PR because none of the ways to legally end her PR status has yet occurred. IRPA s 46. Living outside Canada or failing to renew the PR card do not affect that; **loss of PR status is never automatic.** PR status is only lost if **one of the events in IRPA s 46 occurs**, and must be formally removed by a decision of an officer, and recorded in GCMS. Citizenship would have been possible had she remained in Canada and applied then (she exceeded 1095 days after landing), but citizenship is not automatically granted to PRs, and she no longer meets the residency test to qualify.

<i class="fa-solid fa-4 number"></i>

What is the first thing Salma should do if she hopes to visit her family in Canada?

- [ ] Apply for a travel document to return as a permanent resident.
- [ ] Apply for a visitor visa to visit her daughter and granddaughter.
- [x] Apply to renounce her PR status.
- [ ] Apply for a new PR card to Sydney, Nova Scotia.
> Applying to voluntarily renounce her PR status is the most direct and efficient way to convert from PR status back to foreign national status. The application is processed quickly, then she can apply for a visitor visa. **Reference: IRPR r 72.5 and Guide 5781.** 
> 
> Applying for a travel document to return as a permanent resident will trigger a determination of whether she met the residency obligation. Since she admits she has not, and there appear to be no compelling H&C grounds, that will be refused. **Reference: Guide 5529.** 
> 
> A visitor visa will also be refused as she is not eligible as she is not a foreign national. An application for a new PR card to CPC-Sydney is unlikely to be granted; even if it were, a PR card will not be sent abroad, so she would still need a travel document to return to Canada to pick it up in person. **Reference: IRCC: Apply for, renew or replace a PR card: After you apply.**

Julien wishes to sponsor Elisabeth, his common law partner, and retains Michel, an RCIC in Toronto, to assist him. When Michel meets with Julien to discuss some further details about his relationship with Elisabeth, he notes that Julien is unable to provide answers about basic matters such as Elisabeth's birthdate, family, and educational background. Julien eventually discloses to Michel that he is actually just a family friend who has agreed to help Elisabeth come to Canada. What must Michel do in these circumstances?

- [ ] He must withdraw from representing Julien.
- [ ] He must report Julien to the CICC.
- [x] He must advise Julien that the proposed application is dishonest, fraudulent, or illegal and should not be pursued.
- [ ] He must act in accordance with his client's instructions, since the fraud would likely be discovered by immigration officers anyway.
> If an RCIC is retained and asked to do something that they know or ought to know is dishonest, fraudulent, or illegal, **they must advise the client that the proposed conduct is prohibited and must not be pursued.** 
> 
> The RCIC must **withdraw** from representing the person **only if, despite their advice, the person still intends to pursue the prohibited course of conduct** (Code of Professional Conduct, sections 35(1)(b) and 35(2)).

Renzo is an international student who graduated with a three-year diploma in graphic design from George Brown College in Toronto. He received a three-year open postgraduate work permit, and has been working as a contract graphic designer (a TEER 2 position) in the GTA. He first worked on a six-month contract with a Canadian bank, and immediately afterwards began working on a nine-month contract with a marketing firm in Mississauga. Prior to coming to Canada, he did not have any work experience as a graphic designer. Renzo's nine-month contract will be coming to an end next month, but Renzo would like to continue to work and live in Canada. Renzo retains Brittney, an RCIC in Mississauga, and asks her what his options are for immigrating to Canada permanently at this time. He is 26 years old, single, and a Peruvian citizen. Renzo scored a CLB 8 on the IELTS. In these circumstances, Brittney may advise Renzo that:

- [ ] He does not meet the requirements of any immigration program at this time.
- [x] He meets the requirements for both the CEC and the FSWP.
- [ ] Renzo meets the requirements of the CEC.
- [ ] Renzo meets the requirements of the FSWP.
> Renzo meets the minimum requirements of the **CEC stream**. The work experience requirements for the CEC require an applicant to have **12 months (or the equivalent) of full-time Canadian skilled work experience in a TEER 0, 2, 3, or 3 occupation within the 3 years before applying**. The work experience does not need to be continuous but must be paid. Reference: IRCC.

Ibrahim Kuol, a permanent resident, was landed as a government-sponsored refugee from Sudan three years ago. Before being finally approved for resettlement in Canada, he lived in the Kakuma refugee camp in Kenya for ten years. On his Canadian immigration paperwork, he did not disclose that he was married and had a child, figuring he would sponsor them after he came to Canada. However, they are barred from sponsorship given IRPR r 117(9)(d). Ibrahim has done well in Canada. He has been steadily employed and has kept in touch with his family, sending them money regularly, and visiting twice. He wants you to make a humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) application to try to bring his family to Canada. How will Ibrahim's initial misrepresentation in not declaring his family members affect his H&C application?

- [ ] It will probably result in a refusal as H&C relief under IRPA s 25(1) cannot be granted where there was misrepresentation.
- [ ] Misrepresentation is not considered on an H&C file.
- [x] Misrepresentation is one factor among many that will be considered on the H&C assessment, but is not a bar to a positive decision under IRPA s 25(1).
- [ ] There is a significant risk that Ibrahim's own PR status may be removed for the misrepresentation.
> All factors, including negative factors such as misrepresentation, will be examined on the H&C case and weighed by the officer, as required by IRPA s 25(1). **Inadmissibility due to misrepresentation under IRPA s 40 is not one of the inadmissibility grounds listed in IRPA s 25(1)** that would prohibit granting H&C relief; thus a positive decision is possible despite the earlier misrepresentation. A protected person (unlike other categories) cannot be penalized for misrepresenting facts on their PR application, so there is no risk in that regard: IRPR r 22 and IRPA s 40(1)(a).

However, they are barred from sponsorship given IRPR r 117(9)(d). Ibrahim has done well in Canada. He has been steadily employed and has kept in touch with his family, sending them money regularly, and visiting twice. He wants you to make a humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) application to try and bring his family to Canada. Which of the following factors would be mandatory for the officer to consider?

- [ ] The best interests of Ibrahim's wife as the principal applicant.
- [ ] Ibrahim's ability to support his family in Canada.
- [ ] The ongoing hardship of his family's life in Kenya.
- [x] The best interests of Ibrahim's child.
> Although many factors are considered and assessed on an H&C application, the only one **legally mandated** as a requirement for the officer to consider under IRPA s 25(1) is the **best interests of any child directly affected**.

Viktor is a 42-year-old Canadian permanent resident who emigrated from the Czech Republic. On a trip to Prague to visit his family, his cousin introduced him to Vera, a single mother with a 6-year-old son, Alex. Viktor and Vera spent most of his trip together, and the two married eight days before Viktor had to fly back to Oshawa, Ontario. Upon returning to Canada, Viktor immediately began the process of applying to sponsor Vera and her son for permanent residence under the family class. If their application is accepted, how long would Viktor's undertaking to support Alex be?

- [ ] Until Alex is 25 years old.
- [ ] Until Alex is 22 years old.
- [x] Until Alex is 16 years old.
- [ ] Until Alex is 9 years old.
> Under IRPR r 132(1)(b)(ii), the sponsor's undertaking to a foreign national who is a dependent child of the sponsor's spouse and who is less than 22 years of age lasts until **the earlier of**:
> 
> - **10 years** following the day the dependant becomes a permanent resident; and
> 
> - the day that the dependant turns **25 years old**. Whichever comes first. 
> 
> In this case, since Alex is six years old, the undertaking will last for ten years (i.e., until he turns 16 years old).

Katrina was sponsored by Herman to come to Canada as his common law partner, and she arrived in Vancouver as a permanent resident on February 20, 2015. The couple married in Vancouver on April 1, 2016 and were divorced on March 13, 2020. Katrina is now a Canadian citizen, and is in a relationship with Paolo, a Uruguayan citizen in Canada on a two-year work permit. Katrina and Paolo have been living together in Langley, British Columbia for the past 16 months. Can Katrina sponsor Paolo for permanent residence as a common law partner?

- [x] Yes, because five years have elapsed since she became a permanent resident.
- [ ] No, because five years have not elapsed since her divorce from Herman.
- [ ] No, because Paolo is not eligible as a member of the family class.
- [ ] Yes, because Herman's initial sponsorship undertaking to her has expired.
> Katrina is eligible to sponsor Paolo as **a common law partner** because they have been **cohabiting in a conjugal relationship for more than one year**, and because **five years have elapsed** since she became a permanent resident. Herman's undertaking to support her has also expired (it expired **three years** after she became a permanent resident), but that is not a relevant factor to Katrina's ability to sponsor another common law partner. 
> 
> Under IRPR r 130(3), a sponsor who became a permanent resident after being sponsored as a spouse or common law partner cannot apply to sponsor another foreign national as a spouse or common law partner unless they have been a permanent resident or Canadian citizen, or a combination of the two, for at least five years from the date that Katrina became a permanent resident.

    Joanne, an American citizen, has one offence on her criminal record. She was convicted of causing wilful damage under $1,500, a misdemeanor in Texas, after breaking the window of her ex-husband's car. Your task is to advise her on whether such a minor non-violent criminal offence could make her inadmissible for criminality under IRPA s 36(2)(b). This entails an equivalency analysis. 

<i class="fa-solid fa-1 number"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-2 number"></i>

The most relevant factor in the equivalency analysis would be:

- [ ] The sentence imposed by the court in Texas.
- [ ] The fact that this was a misdemeanour in Texas.
- [ ] The maximum punishment under Texas law for the offence.
- [x] The Canadian classification of the equivalent offence: summary, indictable, or hybrid.
> Under IRPA s 36, the **Canadian classification alone triggers inadmissibility**. A single conviction for an offence which could only be prosecuted by summary conviction had it occurred in Canada does not make one inadmissible. The maximum punishment in the foreign jurisdiction, how the foreign jurisdiction classifies the offence, or the sentence actually imposed by the foreign court are not relevant factors in determining inadmissibility under IRPA s 36.

<i class="fa-solid fa-1 number"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-3 number"></i>

If Joanne were to be found inadmissible for a single offence of criminality under IRPA s **36(2)(b)**, she would be deemed to be rehabilitated:

- [ ] Five years after the date of the conviction.
- [x] Ten years after completion of the sentence.
- [ ] Five years after completion of the sentence.
- [ ] Ten years after the date of the conviction.
> The waiting period for deemed rehabilitation for a single conviction constituting criminality under IRPA s 36(2)(b) is ten years following completion of the sentence, as stated in IRPR r 18(2)(a)(ii). The date of conviction is not the relevant trigger. 
> 
> **Five years** (also from the sentence completion) refers to the **eligibility period for seeking rehabilitation approval** for convictions under IRPA s 36, ==not for deemed rehabilitation==.

Paulina is a citizen of Spain who has owned and operated a perfume business for the past eight years in her home country. She is interested in immigrating to Canada under a business stream of a Provincial Nominee Program (PNP). Which one of the following criteria would qualify her under a PNP business program?

- [ ] An investment of CDN$1 million in savings based on a nominal 5% rate would meet the criteria of most PNP business programs.
- [ ] Work experience in TEER 1 or 2 of the NOC Matrix.
- [ ] Investing in an approved immigration-linked investment scheme.
- [x] Investing in a business in which she will provide an active and ongoing management.
> **PNP Business applicants must provide active and ongoing management** in the business they are investing in pursuant to **IRPR r 87(6)(c)**. 
> 
> **Passive investment proposals are excluded pursuant to IRPR r 87(5).** Business applicants must generally possess either business ownership or management experience to qualify. Those occupations pertain to NOC Broad Occupational Category 0, and not NOC TEER 1 or 2. 
> 
> Immigration-linked investment schemes are excluded pursuant to IRPR r 87(9). Answer "d" is correct. References: IRPR r 87(5), 87(6)(c), IRCC.

Ariana separated from her husband, Paul, after coming out as a transgender woman on her 35th birthday. Although they have now been living separately and apart for eight years, the couple did not divorce, and they have maintained an amicable relationship as co-parents to their 13-year-old daughter, Heather. Ariana immigrated to Canada three years ago to take a job working as the creative director for a large advertising agency and has been living in Toronto with her partner, Kim, for the past two years. After seeing how much Ariana misses having her daughter close by, Kim suggests that they sponsor Paul and Heather for permanent residence, since Ariana and Paul are still legally married. In these circumstances, which of the following is true?

- [ ] Paul and Heather can be sponsored under the family class.
- [x] Ariana cannot sponsor Paul under the family class.
- [ ] Ariana can apply to sponsor Paul and Heather on humanitarian and compassionate grounds.
- [ ] Ariana can apply to sponsor Heather and Paul because Kim consents.
> Ariana cannot sponsor Paul as her spouse because they have been living separately and apart for more than one year, and Ariana is currently the common law partner of another person. 
> 
> See **IRPR r 117(9)(c)(ii)(A)**:
>
> (9) A foreign national shall not be considered a member of the family class by virtue of their relationship to a sponsor if (c) the foreign national is the sponsor’s spouse and (ii) the sponsor has lived separate and apart from the foreign national for at least one year and (A) the sponsor is the common-law partner of another person or the sponsor has a conjugal partner.

If Henry applies through the International Experience Canada program, which category would be most appropriate to his circumstances?

- [x] Working Holiday.

!!! note "Case"

    You are completing a TRP application to submit to the London High Commission for Sean Rooney, an Irish musician. He has a conviction for break-and-entry three years ago. Sean is 56 years old, and is the lead singer of his six-member band, the Irish Blessings—an international pop sensation. Sean has no other convictions on his record and no immigration violations. The concert is set for Massey Hall in Toronto in April. Under IRPA s 24, the officer has discretion to grant a TRP to an inadmissible person to allow them to enter Canada. 

<i class="fa-solid fa-1 number"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-7 number"></i>

The key factor or factors for the officer to consider in exercising their discretion under IRPA s 24 in this case would be:

- [x] Sean's reason for coming to Canada versus any risk he poses to the public.
- [ ] The significant benefit to Canada and the impact of cancellation on the Canadian audience.
- [ ] Under IRPA s 24(1), the only consideration is whether Sean has been rehabilitated.
- [ ] Whether the costs and difficulties Sean would suffer are unreasonable, undeserved, and disproportionate in light of a single offence.
> The IRCC Guidelines state that a TRP under IRPA s 24 will be granted where **the need for the foreign national to enter or remain in Canada is compelling** and those **needs outweigh any risk** to Canadians or Canadian society. Hardship to Sean is not by itself a factor, nor is the impact on Canadians. Nor is there any one predominant factor. However, all circumstances can be taken into account under **IRPA s 24(1)** in the context of whether the reasons are compelling and assessing the risk.



<i class="fa-solid fa-1 number"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-8 number"></i>

The officer may not fetter their discretion. A fettering of discretion in this case would be most apparent if:

- [ ] The officer relied on the wrong section of the IRPA.
- [ ] The officer relied on an irrelevant factor, namely her own view of Irish music.
- [ ] The officer ignored evidence.
- [x] The officer considered the seriousness of Sean's criminal record only, to the exclusion of all other factors raised by him.
> In discretionary decision-making, as required under IRPA s 24 (TRPs) and IRPA s 25 (H&C) in particular, the legislation purposefully gives officers extremely broad scope to consider all factors that justify exercising their discretion in a certain way. In doing so, **they cannot limit their consideration, thus fetter their discretion, by focusing on a single factor as paramount, and refuse to look at other factors which the applicant raised.** As all factors may be put forth by the applicant, the officer must consider and weigh them but cannot just ignore them, as that defeats the purpose of IRPA s 24. The other answers demonstrate different types of legal errors for which the decision could also be overturned on judicial review.

Monique is a 38-year-old American citizen who recently married Riordan, a Canadian. They now plan to move back to Canada to provide more support to Riordan's aging parents. They retain you to file a sponsorship application for Riordan to sponsor Monique in the Spouse or Common-Law Partner in Canada Class. They have collected all the documentation they need, including the required FBI certificate. Once they arrive in Canada, and are ready to file the package, Monique wants to apply simultaneously for the open work permit so she can work as soon as possible. Monique has heard conflicting reports as to whether she will need to give biometrics and seeks your opinion. Will Monique be required to submit biometrics?

- [ ] Yes, because all work permit applicants require biometrics.
- [ ] No, because a US citizen does not require biometrics for any applications.
- [x] Yes, because permanent resident (PR) applicants, including Americans, require biometrics.
- [ ] No, because she has given her fingerprints already for her FBI check.
> **All PR applicants over 14 years old and under 79 years old require biometrics.** There is no exemption for Americans on PR applications, although **Americans are exempt from biometrics on temporary applications**. Monique would not need them for her work permit, but needs them for her PR application. The need for biometrics is unrelated to fingerprinting for police certificate purposes, she will still need to provide them again through a biometrics operator.

Vivian is an RCIC who was informed last week by the CICC that a complaint has been made against her by a former client. Vivian is surprised by the complaint and reviews the client's file. Vivian notes that the client was applying for a start-up visa, and that she had adequately advised the client of the possibility of her application being rejected. Vivian recalls that the client seemed reasonable, and she believes that she can resolve the issue if she meets with the client again to speak with her in person. Should Vivian contact the client to arrange a meeting?

- [ ] Yes, because doing so could avoid a hearing before the College Tribunal.
- [x] No, unless Vivian obtains written consent from the CICC.
- [ ] Yes, provided it is at least 14 days before the disciplinary hearing.
- [ ] No, because she is unlikely to be able to persuade the client to drop the complaint.
> An RCIC shall not communicate directly or indirectly with a person who has made a complaint to the CICC against the RCIC **unless the CICC provides written consent** and the RCIC complies with any terms stipulated by the CICC (Code of Professional Conduct, section 41).

- [ ] They are all required to complete an online eTA application before traveling to Canada.
- [ ] Only Magda is required to apply for an eTA, because she is entering Canada for the purpose of working.
- [ ] Only Renato and their child must obtain their respective eTAs before traveling to Canada.
- [x] None of them are required to complete an online eTA application because they are lawful permanent residents of the US.
> Magda, Renato, and their child do not require an eTA. Prior to April 26, 2022, citizens of a visa-exempt country other than the U.S. required an eTa to travel to or transit through Canadian airports, but current policy states that **lawful permanent residents of the U.S. do not need an eTa.** They must, however, present their passports and proof of their valid lawful permanent resident status in the U.S. References: IRCC Electronic travel authorization

Although she has not secured a job offer yet, she is confident that she will find a position soon after graduation, as she has made many contacts through her friends and colleagues in her program. Which of the following is true?

- [ ] Phouvong is not eligible to apply for a postgraduate work permit because she does not have a valid job offer.
- [x] If granted, Phouvong's postgraduate work permit will be valid for three years.
- [ ] If granted, Phouvong's postgraduate work permit will be valid for four years.
- [ ] Phouvong must apply for a postgraduate work permit before she graduates.
> If an applicant's length of studies is for two years or more, a work permit may be issued for three years. 
> 
> It is not correct that Phouvong must apply for a postgraduate work permit before she graduates. An applicant for a postgraduate work permit must apply within 180 days after their school has issued their final marks. However, she must either **apply for a PGWP before her study permit expires**, apply for a visitor record and subsequently apply for a PGWP from within Canada, or leave Canada and apply for a PGWP from abroad.

!!! note "Case Study"

    Santiago is a 24-year-old citizen of Colombia and of no other country. Since coming out as gay at the age of 20, Santiago has become an outspoken leader in the LGBTQ+ activist community. He often organizes community events, manages online forums, and encourages people to share stories of discrimination and denounce government inaction. While working as an activist in Colombia, Santiago experienced a couple minor incidents of discrimination but never feared that he would be persecuted on the basis of his sexual orientation. During a trip to Montreal to visit his family, however, several members of his LGBTQ+ activist group are arrested and beaten during a protest. He receives news from a friend in Colombia that the police are looking for Santiago. The police made several threats that they would "put an end" to Santiago's activities and make him "regret his life choices." Santiago fears returning home and decides to stay in Montreal. He makes an appointment with Sandra, an RCIC, for a consultation.

    
<i class="fa-solid fa-2 number"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-7 number"></i>

Which of the following is accurate advice for Sandra to give regarding a potential refugee claim?

- [ ] Regardless of the basis for Santiago's claim, citizens of Colombia have a high acceptance rate so it makes sense to pursue a claim.
- [x] Santiago's refugee claim could be based on the activities that happened after he left his country and so it would be advisable for him to file a refugee claim ***sur place***.
- [ ] Santiago did not make a refugee claim immediately upon arrival in Canada and therefore he may not be eligible to file a claim.
- [ ] Santiago does not meet the definition of a Convention refugee since he did not personally experience threats, violence, or persecution while in his home country.
> Sandra may advise Santiago to file a refugee claim ***sur place***. The IRB states that: "a ***sur place*** claim is one in which a claimant alleges that they have a well-founded fear of persecution because of events that occurred after they left. A claimant may claim to be at risk because of their actions in Canada, as a consequence of events which have occurred in their country of origin since departure, or because of a significant intensification of pre-existing factors since departure." Reference: IRB. 
> 
> See *Ghasemian v Canada (MCI)*, 2003 FC 1266, for an example of a ***sur place*** claim. Every potential refugee claim should be examined on its merits, regardless of the acceptance rates for that particular country of origin. Delay in making a claim does not in itself affect eligibility; it can however negatively impact the claim (subjective fear) if the claimant cannot provide a reasonable explanation for the delay. 
> 
> Note that delay should not be a factor when the claimant was legally admitted to Canada and continued to have legal status in Canada at the time they applied for refugee status. 
> 
> In this case, if an explanation is needed, delay can easily be explained since it is a *sur place* claim. By the very definition of *sur place* claim, it is not necessary for Santiago to have experienced any threats or fear of persecution while he was still in his home country.

If Santiago is deemed a vulnerable claimant and the Minister is not a party to the claim, what will be the order of questioning during his hearing?

- [ ] Any witness, including Santiago, will be questioned first by the Member and then by Sandra.
- [ ] Any witness, including Santiago, will be questioned first by Sandra and then by the Member.
- [ ] The Member may vary the order of questioning to accommodate Santiago.
- [ ] Only the Member may question Santiago because the Minister's representative is not present.
> The standard order of questioning is: if the Minister is not a party, any witness, including the claimant, will be questioned **first by the Member** and **then by the claimant's counsel** (RPD Rules, 10(1)).

Nikola immigrated from Serbia and became a Canadian citizen on September 23, 2015. Recently, it was discovered that he had previously been convicted of theft in Belgrade in the late 1990s, and had served a four-year prison sentence that he completed prior to immigrating to Hamilton, Ontario. This was not initially discovered by visa officers because Nikola submitted in his application for permanent resident status a forged criminal record that he obtained by bribing a police officer. In these circumstances:

- [x] Nikola's citizenship will be revoked, he will become a foreign national, and he will be **barred from reapplying for ten years**.
- [ ] Nikola's citizenship will be revoked, he will become a foreign national, and he will be permanently barred from reapplying.
- [ ] Nikola's citizenship will be revoked, he will become a permanent resident, and he may apply for citizenship according to the normal timelines.
- [ ] Nikola's citizenship will be revoked, he will become a permanent resident, and he will be barred from reapplying for ten years.
> Citizenship Act s 10(1) allows the minister to revoke a person's citizenship if they are satisfied on **a balance of probabilities** that the person obtained their citizenship through false representation or by knowingly concealing material circumstances. Because Nikola's citizenship will be revoked on the grounds that he became a permanent resident by false representation or fraud, he will **revert to foreign national** status; 
> 
> **reverting to permanent resident status applies only to an individual whose citizenship was revoked due to fraud during the citizenship process.** A person who has had their citizenship revoked can never apply for resumption of citizenship, but Nikola may reapply for citizenship after ten years from the date of revocation.

Zhang came to Canada as a permanent resident under the OINP's Human Capital Priorities stream and wants to sponsor his wife and son for permanent residence. Zhang's son, Bing, has not lived with his father for almost seven years, because Zhang was working in Shanghai and other cities in southern China before coming to Canada. However, Zhang always sent half of his income home to his family and paid Bing's tuition for his undergraduate degree at Harbin Engineering University, which Bing has successfully completed. Bing is currently 21 years old, and Zhang believes that sponsoring him will give him the chance to enroll in a Canadian university for his masters degree. In these circumstances:

- [ ] Bing does not meet the definition of a dependent child because he is over 19 years of age.
- [ ] Bing meets the definition of a dependant because he has depended on Zhang's financial support from before the age of 22.
- [x] Bing meets the definition of a dependent child because he is under 22 years old and is unmarried.
- [ ] Bing does not meet the definition of a dependent child because he is not a full-time student.

!!! note "Case Study"

    Kirk is an RCIC who was recently hired by Samira, a refugee claimant from Pakistan. Samira's refugee application and RPD hearing were handled by a different RCIC, Melissa. After Samira's refugee claim was denied, she decided to hire Kirk to handle her case. She explained to Kirk that Melissa was rarely available leading up to the hearing and changed her contact information without informing Samira. Samira contacted Melissa to terminate their service agreement one and a half months ago, but she has not heard from Melissa since then. Samira instructs Kirk to get in touch with Melissa because she does not have all the documents that go with her file. Kirk then contacts Melissa and asks her why she did not make herself available leading up to Samira's hearing. Kirk also requests the missing paperwork. Melissa discloses that she had been retained by Samira, but she refuses to provide any further assistance with Samira's matter. Kirk then sends Melissa a scathing note containing offensive language and tells her that he plans to represent Samira even if he does not have all the important documents from her file.



<i class="fa-solid fa-3 number"></i><i class="fa-solid fa-2 number"></i>

Has Kirk breached the Code of Professional Ethics?

- [x] Yes, because Kirk was discourteous towards Melissa.
- [ ] No, because Kirk is taking reasonable and necessary steps to minimize any prejudice to his client.
- [ ] No, because Kirk gave Melissa a fair opportunity to provide an explanation and send the documents requested.
- [ ] Yes, because Kirk is not allowed to poach clients from another Member while the matter is still ongoing.
> Kirk has breached the Code of Professional Conduct.** A licensee shall be courteous and civil in all professional dealings with other Members** (section 7). 
> 
> Under section 42(2)(f), Kirk may also have **an obligation to report his fellow licensee to the College**, as the Code obliges licensees to report any situation in which a fellow licensee's clients are likely to be severely prejudiced.

GridWorks Innovations is an American company that designs and manufactures residential and commercial power grids, backup generators, solar panels, and electric car chargers. Casper is an American citizen who is employed with NPS as a senior electrical engineer. GridWorks Innovations has recently sold a custom-designed rooftop solar panel system with a battery backup and integrated car charger to a residential customer in southern Ontario. The sale was finalized at Northfield's storefront in Buffalo, New York; the batteries, car charger components, and other electrical components were manufactured in Michigan; and the solar panels were manufactured in Stuttgart, Germany. Due to the complexity of the system, they intend to send Casper to install and test the software that governs the system, while the actual installation will be performed by a local Canadian team. 

Can Casper enter Canada to perform this work under CUSMA's after-sales service provision?

- [ ] Yes, because the installation work requires specialized knowledge.
- [x] No, because the equipment and software are for residential use.
- [ ] Yes, because Casper will only be setting up and testing the software, not performing building and construction work.

GridWorks Innovations is an American company that designs and manufactures residential and commercial power grids, backup generators, solar panels, and electric car chargers. Eleven years ago, Northfield sold an off-grid backup system to the Canadian subsidiary of an American oil and gas corporation. The sale was finalized at Northfield's storefront in Buffalo, New York; the batteries, other electrical components, and software were manufactured and developed in Michigan; and the solar panels were manufactured in Stuttgart, Germany. All components came with a ten-year warranty with options for extension; the purchasing company chose to extend the warranty one year ago for a further five-year term. At the time of the sale, Northfield was performing its own warranty work. Northfield is now dividing their warranty work between their own in-house team and a separate contracting company, Mackinac Technical, who are established in Saginaw, Michigan. The backup system now needs a major software re-installation that can only be performed with a specialist on-site at the equipment's location in Manitoba. 

Can specialists from Mackinac Technical enter Canada under CUSMA's after-sales service provision on behalf of Northfield to provide this service?

- [x] No, because the sales agreement did not specify that a third party would perform the warranty work.
- [ ] No, because the sales agreement did not name Mackinac Technical as the firm that would perform the warranty work.
- [ ] No, because the warranty work is not pursuant to the original warranty.
- [ ] Yes.
> To fall under the third party service section of the CUSMA after-sales service provisions, **CUSMA requires that the sales agreement contain clear wording that a third party will perform the installation, warranty, or service work.** It does not require the third party firm providing the service to be named in the sales agreement. 
> 
> It permits the initial warranty or service agreement **to be extended** provided that the initial warranty or service agreement contained a provision **allowing for that extension**. 
> 
> Because the original sales agreement did not contain a provision specifying that a third party would be performing the warranty work, Northfield would not be able to rely on CUSMA's after-sales service provisions to send technicians from Mackinac Technical to Canada to perform this work.

Larry is a Canadian citizen seeking to sponsor the following relatives under the Family Class program: **his spouse, Ileana, and their four dependent children, ages 3, 6, 18, and 20.** Larry works as a used car salesperson in Windsor. His income is commission-based, and unfortunately, due to market fluctuations, his sales have been very low. Due to Larry's low income, his father, who is a successful businessman, is willing to financially assist Larry with his sponsorship application, if needed. Larry has retained the legal services of Ramira, a regulated Canadian immigration consultant, to prepare his case and represent him in this matter. 

Which government forms must Ramira provide and submit in this case?

- [ ] Since Larry's income is low, his father should act as a co-signer and as a result both of them should sign the application to sponsor, sponsorship agreement, and undertaking (IMM 1344).
- [ ] Larry must complete the financial evaluation form (IMM 1283) to prove that he meets the minimum necessary income required to sponsor his spouse and four dependent children.
- [ ] Larry's spouse and four dependent children must complete and sign the additional family information form (IMM 5406).
- [x] Larry is exempt from having to meet the minimum necessary income requirement and he must complete the relationship information and sponsorship evaluation form (IMM 5532).
> It is correct that Larry is exempt from having to meet the minimum necessary income requirement and that he must complete the relationship information and sponsorship evaluation form (IMM 5532).

**Mikke** came to Canada on a temporary resident visa to visit his brother, **Jere**. Jere owns an interior design business in Edmonton. He has several projects to complete but unfortunately he is understaffed at the moment. Mikke, like his brother, also has a background in interior design and so he has been assisting his brother while in Canada with the completion of various projects. Since Mikke is not in possession of a work permit, he is not in the company's payroll but he receives a cash commission for each completed contract. 

According to the legislation, is Mikke performing "work"?

- [ ] Yes, because he is earning Canadian wages and his employment will result in job creation for Canadian citizens or permanent residents.
- [ ] No, because he is not on the company's payroll and as a result there is no employer-employee relationship.

During the initial consultation, she provides you with an overview of her educational, professional, and financial background, as follows: 
    
    She completed a **four-year bachelor degree** in civil engineering at York University in Toronto, Ontario. 
    
    In 2020, she worked as a civil engineer for **one year on a full-time** continuous basis in Canada while in possession of a NAFTA work permit. Subsequently, she returned to Colombia, where she worked as a civil engineer for **18 months** before becoming a stay-at-home mother. 
    
    She is proficient in English, but not in French. In the IELTS test, she obtained a **CLB 9** in each of the four language abilities. 
    
    She has a **cousin who resides in Vancouver**. 
    
    She is married to **Esteban**, who is not planning to accompany her to Canada due to business commitments. They have a blended family including three healthy children aged: **22, 15 and 7** who will be accompanying Alexandria to Canada. Alexandria has adopted Esteban's two older children and is their legal parent. 
    
    Alexandria has **$5,000** in her bank account available for settlement in Canada.

- [x] Canadian Experience Class.
- [ ] Federal Skilled Trades Class.
- [ ] British Columbia Provincial Nominee Program—Skilled Workers category.

Since Esteban will not be accompanying Alexandria to Canada, it is irrelevant to ask questions about his educational/professional background, as Alexandria will not be benefiting from it. **Having a cousin in Canada does not represent any advantage under any immigration category subject to Express Entry** (i.e., Federal Skilled Worker Class, Federal Skilled Trades Class, or Canadian Experience Class) or under the comprehensive ranking system of Express Entry.

!!! note "Case Study"

    **Carolina** is a citizen of Mexico and of no other country. At the age of 19, Carolina moved from Mexico to Belgium to pursue her post-secondary studies. After graduating, she was able to start working and access social services including healthcare. She remained in Belgium for three years before moving back to Mexico to be closer to her family. After returning to Mexico, Carolina developed an intimate relationship with **Ernesto**, a young lawyer, whom she met online. Ernesto was kind and romantic at first, but he quickly became controlling and abusive. He withheld money from her, and so she had to resort to shoplifting to feed herself. After just six months together, Carolina had endured frequent beatings and ended up hospitalized twice as a result of Ernesto's physical abuse. Ernesto also threatened Carolina, telling her that if she tried to leave he would have her killed. In July 2023, Carolina decided to report him to the police. When they took no action, she became afraid of him finding out that she went to the police, and fearing for her life, she decided to flee. She could return to Belgium and restore her status in that country, but she decided she would go to Canada instead since she has family in Vancouver. Unfortunately, she didn't have enough money or a valid passport for the flight, so she ended up having to wait before leaving Mexico. She finally arrived in Canada and made a refugee claim at a port of entry on **June 9, 2024**. A week after arriving, she learned that Ernesto had been killed in a car accident.

The existence of an Article 1E country (Belgium), however, does not render the claim ineligible to be referred to the RPD. She could be excluded under Article 1E if the RPD determines that she can return to Belgium to live safely and has the same basic rights and obligations as the nationals of that country.

**Richard** came to Calgary, Alberta, in 2017 as a permanent resident through the Express Entry program as a Federal Skilled Worker. In December 2018, he returned to his hometown, Birmingham, England, to spend his holidays with his friends and family. Following a raucous night on the town with his cousin and high school mates, he was charged with public drunkenness, which is the equivalent of a summary conviction offence in Canada. He pled guilty on October 19, 2019. In these circumstances:

- [ ] Richard is inadmissible, cannot return to Canada, and cannot apply for individual rehabilitation until December 19, 2024.
- [x] Richard can immediately return to Canada because the criminality provisions do not apply to him.
- [ ] Richard is inadmissible and cannot return to Canada until December 19, 2024, when he will be deemed rehabilitated.
- [ ] Richard can immediately return to Canada, but will be referred to the Immigration Division to attend an admissibility hearing.
> Richard pled guilty to public drunkenness. However, Richard will not be found inadmissible on the grounds of criminality because the offence is equivalent to a summary conviction offence in Canada (Criminal Code, s 175(1)(a)(ii)), and because the criminality provisions apply only to foreign nationals (IRPA, s 36(2)).

Many years ago, Alvita made a refugee claim to the Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, which was refused. However, she complied with the removal order and left Canada on the required date. 

Based on the information provided does Alvita meet the criteria under the PNP Nova Scotia—Skilled Worker Stream?

- [ ] Yes. She meets the eligibility criteria.
- [x] She does not meet the eligibility criteria, because she has applied for refugee status and has been refused.
- [ ] She does not meet the eligibility criteria, because her profession is regulated in Nova Scotia.
- [ ] She does not meet the eligibility criteria, because her age is not within the allowed age range.
> Alvita does not meet the eligibility criteria under the PNP Nova Scotia—Skilled Worker Stream, because she has applied for refugee status and has been refused. **A refugee claimant or an unsuccesful refugee claimant is not eligible to apply under the Nova Scotia Nominee Program—Skilled Worker Stream.** The reason why she does not meet the eligibility criteria under the PNP Nova Scotia—Skilled Worker Stream is not because of her profession or her age; it is because she is a failed refugee claimant.

**Randy** was adopted from South Korea in 1980, when he was two years old, and he became a Canadian citizen by grant through his adoptive parents. The family stayed in South Korea until Randy was five, and then returned to the adoptive parents' hometown of Toronto, Ontario, where they adopted his younger sister. Growing up, Randy's parents were always open with him whenever he had questions about his background, and he has been volunteering with children's advocacy and mentorship groups for most of his life. Randy recently went back to his birth city of Seoul and, while there, he decided to adopt a one-year-old girl named **Joon**, whom he met through an international adoption agency. 

In these circumstances, which of the following is true?

- [x] Randy can sponsor Joon for permanent residence under the family class of the IRPA.
- [ ] Randy can apply for a direct grant of citizenship for Joon under the Citizenship Act.
- [ ] Randy can sponsor Joon for permanent residence under the IRPA or apply for a direct grant of citizenship for Joon under the Citizenship Act.
- [ ] Randy can apply for conditional citizenship for Joon under the Citizenship Act.
> Randy is a Canadian citizen by grant who was adopted outside Canada, the "second-generation cut-off" would typically apply (Citizenship Act, s 3(3)(a)) and Randy wiould not be eligible to pass on Canadian citizenship because he was adopted in a foreign country. 
> 
> However based on the new legislation passed in May 2024, canadian citizenship is automatically conferred to children born abroad and adopated by a Canadian parent beyond the first generation. Parents born abroad will need to have spent at least **1,095 cumulative days** of physical presence in Canada prior to the birth or adoption of their child to pass on citizenship.

Dina returned to Toronto in January 2024 and has not left the country yet this year. She recently retained **Victoria**, an RCIC, to inquire about whether she can apply for Canadian citizenship. Victoria should advise Dina that:

- [ ] She does not meet the residency requirements for citizenship.

- [ ] Carmen should apply for permanent residence through Express Entry.
> Carmen's employer must obtain an offer of employment number from IRCC, and subsequently, Carmen should apply for an LMIA-exempt work permit under CUSMA to IRCC. Due to Carmen's Mexican citizenship, education, and professional background as a medical doctor/physician, she meets the criteria for an LMIA-exempt work permit under CUSMA. Despite being exempt from the LMIA provision, Carmen's employer is still required to apply for and obtain an offer of employment number from IRCC (this requirement allows IRCC to monitor employer compliance). Upon receipt of this number, Carmen should apply for her CUSMA work permit to IRCC. Carmen does not meet the criteria of the GATS, because, among other factors, her profession as a medical doctor is not included in the GATS list of professional occupations. Carmen has not indicated that her intention is to permanently settle in Canada, so it is not appropriate to recommend that she apply for permanent residence.
