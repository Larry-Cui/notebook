## ESDC In Charge of LMIA

Temporary Foreign Worker Program (TFWP) allow local companies in Canada to hire qualified foreign workers to fill job positions that are otherwise not fillable by Canadian citizens or permanent residents. [Employment and Social Development Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development.html){:target="_blank"} is running this program. Any company who wants to hire foreign workers must get a [Labour Market Impact Assessment ("LMIA")](https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=163&top=17){:target="_blank"} from ESDC, except for some very limited [industries or positions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/hire-temporary-foreign/find-need-labour-market-impact-assessment.html#do_you_nedd_LMIA){:target="_blank"}. 

A company must apply LMIA for each and every position and pay $1,000 processing fee to ESDC. Two points should be noted:

- The processing fee won't be refunded if the application is withdrawn, cancelled or if the LMIA is negative. 
- The processing fee **cannot be paid by nor be recovered** from the very temporary foreign workers.

As part of the LMIA requirements, a company must conduct recruitment efforts to hire Canadians and permanent residents before offering a job to a TFW. To be more specific, or as a common practice, a company needs to carry out job advertisements as an evidence of its recruitment efforts. In this article, we focus on some points a recruiting company should pay attention to during its job advertisement.
