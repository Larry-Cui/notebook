# Visitor visas Application from inside Canada

The IRCC won't simultaneously give out a visitor visa if an applicant is extending or renewing a work permit or a study permit. If the applicant's visitor visa is expired or is about to expire, he may want to apply separately for a new visitor when he is still in Canada.

This post discusses how to apply in such a situation. Please see [IRCC website](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/visit-canada/apply-new-temporary-resident-visa-within-canada.html){:target="_blank"} for details. 

## Who can apply

You can only apply for a visitor visa from inside Canada if you meet **all** of these criteria:

- [x] already are in Canada
- [x] hold a valid study or work permit
- [x] want to leave and return to Canada in the near future, and
- [x] have an existing visitor visa that’s expired, or is about to expire, or that was valid for only 1 entry

!!! note ""

    If you **already left** Canada and need to apply for a new visitor visa, you must follow the process to **apply for a visa from outside Canada** instead of the inside Canada process outlined below. There are different requirements you may need to meet since you’re outside Canada.

## When to apply

As soon as the IRCC approve your application to extend your work or study permit, you can apply for your visitor visa (**even before** you get your new work or study permit in the mail).

An applicant should **not leave Canada** until he gets his visitor visa.

## How to apply

You need to apply online in your IRCC secure account.

The application form listed in your document checklist will be called *Application for Visitor Visa (Temporary Resident Visa) Made Outside of Canada* (IMM 5257). **This is the form you need to fill out, even when you apply from inside Canada.**

Use your account to pay your fees and check your application status.
