??? note "Recourses for Clients Facing Removal"

    - For most inadmissibilities based on security or criminality, the removal order is issued by the **Immigration Division** after a hearing. For most immigration-related inadmissibilities – like failing to appear for an examination (IRPR, paragraph 229(1)(j)) – the removal order is issued by the **Officer** themselves under **section 44(2)**.
    - **Departure** Order: A departure order is issued for less serious breaches of Canadian immigration law. If the person leaves Canada within 30 days of the issuance of the order, and obtains a certificate of departure when they leave Canada, they can apply to come back in the future without any special authorization required.
    - **Exclusion** Order: An exclusion order is a removal order that carries with it the penalty of barring return to Canada for **between one and five years** unless you can get special permission to return. An exclusion order is issued for immigration penalties like failing to report for an examination or for misrepresentation. **If issued an exclusion order, the person must also apply for an Authorization to Return to Canada (ARC) under section 52 of the IRPA if they want to come back within the period of the bar on return.**
    - **Deportation** Order: A deportation order **permanently bars** someone from ever coming back to Canada without an ARC. This is typically issued by the Immigration Division for **security or criminality inadmissibility**.
    - Sections **223 to 226** of IRPR sets out which removal order will apply to which situation.
    - Sections **230-234** of IRPR: remedies include a pre-removal risk assessment (**PRRA**), a positive decision on a humanitarian and compassionate application (**H&C**), and a positive decision on a motion for a **judicial stay** of removal.
    - The most commonly used applications for people who have exhausted their other remedies to stay in Canada:
        - **PRRA**: a PRRA application **suspends** enforcement of a removal order. In most cases, **Protected Person status** (i.e., refugee protection and the ability to apply for permanent residence as a protected person); If inadmissible under sections 34-37, a stay of removal.
        - **H&C**: **Deportation continue** while the application is in process. An approval in principle for permanent residence **pending** security, criminality, medical and other inadmissibility checks
        - Temporary Residence Permit (**TRP**): **Deportation continue** while the application is in process. Valid temporary residence in Canada, which if issued for over six months, includes a right to apply for a work and study permit, for the duration of the permit.
        - **Deferral Request**: **Deportation continue** while the application is in process. Removal is “**deferred**” or postponed, pending some other application (the decision on your H&C or TRP) or event (for example, the birth of a child or the end of a school year).
    - As you know the **PRRA is based on sections 96 and 97** (i.e., harms in your country of origin), while the H&C is a holistic assessment of establishment in Canada, the best interests of children, and any adverse country conditions to determine if as a whole the evidence “would excite in a reasonable [person] in a civilized community a desire to relieve the misfortunes of another”: *Kanthasamy v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2015 SCC 61](https://canlii.ca/t/gmgsk), [2015] 3 S.C.R. 909, citing *Chirwa v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)* (1970), 4 I.A.C. 338.
    - **TRP** does not stop removal and take time for a decision, you will typically end up using deferral requests and H&Cs more frequently.
    - Often deferral requests are rejected, and so must be followed by a motion for a stay of removal in Federal Court, for which your client will have to retain a lawyer.

??? note "Choosing the Right Application"

    - PRRA Application. 
        - A person is “**PRRA-barred**” or cannot bring a PRRA until **a year after the last decision in their refugee claim**. If a year has passed there is no problem, but if it has not, the client will need to combine their PRRA with a Deferral Request to postpone removal until the person is eligible for a PRRA.
        - For persons inadmissible for security, international crimes, serious criminality and organized criminality (ss. 34-37), the Officer can **only look at section 97** risks (torture) and cannot get permanent protection from the PRRA but only a stay of removal based on a subsequent balancing of risk with the person’s danger to Canada: See section **113 of the IRPA**.
    - H&C Application.
        - There is also a 12-month H&C bar from the last day of any refugee refusal. The bar has two exceptions: if the best interests of the child are affected by the application and if there are life-threatening health issues in the country of origin.
        - Persons who have been found inadmissible under sections 34 (security), 35 (international crimes), or 37 (organized criminality) cannot apply for an H&C.
    - Temporary Resident Permit (TRP).
        - A TRP is like an H&C but it is for a given length of time. It is an option for people who have a specific reason to remain for a given period and then leave, or those who have inadmissibilities that prevent them from bringing an H&C.
        - Usually, unless your client is barred from an H&C by a section 34-36 inadmissibility, you will want to bring an H&C instead.
        - IRPA sections **24(3.1)-24(4)**: it **cannot be requested** if your client has been found ineligible to have their claim referred to the **RPD** and a **PRRA** application is **pending**, and it cannot be requested **within a year of the final refusal of a refugee** claim by either the IRB or (if judicial review has been sought) the Federal Court.
    - Deferral Request. 
        - Finally there is the deferral request made directly to an officer pursuant to IRPA section 48. It asks a deferral officer to exercise their discretion to postpone the removal based on a compelling circumstance.
        - The deferral request is a last resort and it cannot be submitted until a deportation date is set.

??? note "Weighing your Client's Options"

    - The Waschlo Family. The Waschlo family are citizens of Poland. They are Joseph, his wife, Olga and their two children aged six and nine. Joseph used to work for the military and received threats after he reported corruption in his unit. His refugee claim was refused on credibility and state protection and the judicial review of his RAD appeal was denied three weeks ago. Joseph says that he learned during the judicial review application that his brother has recently disappeared and the family does not know why but suspects it may relate to the risk from the security and intelligence forces. The family have been in Canada for three years, Joseph works full-time in construction and Olga works part-time as a nurse. Olga’s sister lives in Canada and is a Canadian citizen. Her children are close to Joseph and Olga’s children.
        - What factors speak for and against a PRRA?
            - The disappearance of Joseph’s brother is a new fact that may prove that the family is at risk despite the RPD and RAD decisions. This speaks to the need for a PRRA; however, the family are PRRA-barred by IRPA section 112(2)(b.1). 
            - You will want to have them prepare this possible evidence just in case as well as start arranging for psychiatric reports to speak to the harm of removal. They will get a letter from the CBSA when enforcement action will be taken. You need to make sure that they can get mail from the CBSA either through their former counsel or their address. Strategically, quickly updating the address will bring the CBSA’s attention to your clients so you don’t want to if you can help it; but, if there is no other way to get mail you will have no other choice. Your hope is that the CBSA sits on the file a long time to get you as close as possible to the end of the PRRA-bar, and an even longer time for a decision on the H&C. 
        - What factors speak for and against an H&C?
            - **Your clients are H&C barred as well, but as their application will be based on the best interests of the child, they meet an exception to the bar.** The family’s work history, their children’s formative years as young children (for a six-year-old, three years in Canada is half their life), their children’s proficiency in English over Polish, their family connections and community connections, and their work history in Canada all make it advisable to try an H&C.
        - How should you advise your client?
            - If a removal date is set before the end of a PRRA-bar, the only hope will be a **deferral** based on the **new evidence** of risk in Poland and any evidence about psychological **harm to the children** from being removed to Canada and going to Poland where they have never been.
            - Have an honest conversation with the family at the beginning. While a PRRA will keep them in Canada if you can get there, it is by no means a sure thing since the IRB has already found their risk not to be credible. Their **H&C is their best chance**, but three years in Canada is not an exceptionally long period of time and there is no particular factor (like a health condition that will go untreated in the home country) that makes it especially compelling. It definitely has a chance due to the children’s connection to Canada and the family’s good work history but there are no guarantees. Finally, if a deferral and stay is required, and the family do not qualify for legal aid, the costs for all of the potential applications here may be close to $10,000 or more.
            - How to proceed is the family’s choice. If they deeply fear a return to Poland and/or cannot bear to leave Canada, then this is their only chance. Your job is to give them a realistic picture of what is available and their chances of success so that they can make an informed decision.
    - Prasanna. Prasanna is a citizen of India. He came to Canada in 2011 and studied in his undergraduate degree in Toronto, graduating in 2016. Although he worked after graduation, he was not able to find full-time work in his field and thus does not qualify for PR through Canada Experience Class. For the last three years he has been working cash jobs in various fields. In 2017, he married his longtime girlfriend who is a Canadian citizen and in 2019 his wife gave birth to their daughter. Late that same year she applied to sponsor him through an in-Canada spousal sponsorship. Tragically, in 2020, with the sponsorship still in progress, Prasanna’s wife died of cancer. His former counsel updated immigration about this development and they denied the sponsorship. He is now being called in to report to the CBSA. What can he do?
        - What factors speak for and against a PRRA?
            - As a removal order is now in force, Prasanna cannot make a refugee claim. He could ask for a PRRA but when you inquire, he does not fear anything in India.
        - What factors speak for and against an H&C?
            - The most compelling fact in Prasanna’s situation is the plight of his Canadian daughter, who has just tragically lost her mother. This kind of humanitarian factor could have been taken into account in the sponsorship application if Prasanna’s former counsel had raised these grounds. As such, the first step may be a request to **reopen the sponsorship** to ask for approval of the PR on H&C grounds based on the best interests of his daughter.
        - How should you advise your client?
            - Along with **reopening** the application for sponsorship, Prasanna would do well to get a**n H&C application** in as soon as possible. The baby's maternal grandparents are willing to care for their granddaughter so that she can remain in Canada. However, the baby will lose both her parents in close succession if her father is deported. You should advise him to get a **psychological assessment** done and obtain letters that show **his establishment** in Canada, his closeness to his late wife’s family and letters from them about how they cannot bear to lose their son-in-law after suffering such a loss.
            - When a removal date is finally set, Prasanna will have to apply for a **deferral** of removal pending the H&C. He would base this on psychological harm of leaving Canada after so long, of the impact on his right to parent his daughter, and on the impact of his Canadian daughter of not being with her father.

???+ note "PPSA"

    - A PRRA is most commonly brought by refused refugee claimants based on new events or evidence that was not reasonably available at the time of their refugee claim.
    - The Federal Court in *Figurado v Minister (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2005 FC 347](https://canlii.ca/t/1k2fm){:target="\_blank"}, described the purpose of the PRRA as follows:
        - [40]The PRRA process was implemented to allow individuals to apply for a review of the conditions surrounding the risk of return **prior to their removal from Canada and not after their removal**. Indeed, the PRRA emerged as a result of the jurisprudence of the Federal Court of Appeal and the Supreme Court of Canada, which required a timely risk assessment to comply with section 7 of the Charter [Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, being Part I of the Constitution Act, 1982, Schedule B, Canada Act 1982, 1982, c. 11 (U.K.) [R.S.C., 1985, Appendix II, No. 44]] (Farhadi v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) (2000), 6 Imm. L.R. (3d) 80 (F.C.A.); Suresh v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2002 SCC 1 (CanLII), [2002] 1 S.C.R. 3).
    - Section 112 tells us that a PRRA can only be submitted once you are subject to a removal order that is in force. Your client will be called in to CBSA during removal proceedings and, if they are eligible, invited for a PRRA. **Clients must wait for the PRRA to be initiated by the CBSA.**
    - For those who are PRRA-eligible, they will be given the PRRA form by the CBSA and told that they have **15 days to provide the form** and **30 days to provide evidence and submissions**.
    - As long as the form is submitted in that time, your client will benefit from the statutory **stay of removal** in **section 232** of the IRPR until the PRRA is decided.
    - A second PRRA does not give an automatic stay.
    - You need to show one of the following:
        - Things have changed **in the country of origin** so that findings about risk made at the IRB are no longer correct
        - Things have changed **for your client** such that there are now **new risks** that were not assessed by the IRB
        - Things have changed **for your client** such that there is now important **new evidence** that might have changed the IRB’s mind but could not be presented earlier
    - The limitation of the PRRA to “new evidence” is codified in IRPA subsection **113(a)**:
        - an applicant whose claim to refugee protection has been rejected may present only **new evidence** that arose after the rejection or was not reasonably available, or that the applicant could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection;
    - In addition, subsection 161(2) of the IRPR provides:
        - A person who makes written submissions must identify the evidence presented that meets the requirements of paragraph 113(a) of the Act and indicate how that evidence relates to them.
    - *Raza v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2007 FCA 385](https://canlii.ca/t/1v1pq){:target="\_blank"}. In setting out the test at paragraph 13, the Court of Appeal clarified that the test is just “new evidence”. **It can be about the same risk but must meet the following criteria**.
