# Module 6: Preparing for the Detention Review 

## Notes

??? note "Tutorial notes"

    - Wednesday 4:00pm.
    - likelihood of long detention: if it's about removal, minister is to work on the process; if it's about legalization of the PC, the PC is to provide steps or efforts he's taking toward the result.

??? note "Where to Start"

    - Navigate the anxiety of friends and family
        - As you have already learned, detention reviews happen 48 hours after detention, 7 days after detention, and then every 30 days after that. Although it is understandable that a detained person or their family may want you to attend a review as soon as possible, it is important to make sure you have all the facts. Once you are prepared and have everything together, you can even request an **early detention review**. 
    - Establish contact with the client
        - In your initial conversation with your client, the first thing to make clear is the terms of your retainer – i.e., what are they hiring you to do.
    - Get the information you need
        - Remember that people don’t always have the best or most accurate memory of every event in their life. At the same time, CBSA’s file may contain false information. You will have to dig down and use your instincts to get to the truth. 
    - Procure the client's signature
        - Here's an example [cover letter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h-kxiefQEX-HSORKq2OUcjVrWAN-kk99/view?usp=sharing){:target="\_blank"} to the Immigration Holding Center (IHC).
        - To Whom It May Concern: I am in the process of being retained by Mr. Mohammed Raeesi. I believe he is in room 223. Please kindly assist him in signing and dating the attached Use of a Representative form at Section D at the bottom of the second page beside where I have marked and then returning this to me as soon as possible. Thank you for your assistance. Sincerely, The Immigration Justice League

??? note "Obtaining Relevant Information"

    - A foundational principle of natural justice is **the right to know the case to meet**. The government has an obligation to share even “**exculpatory**” evidence — i.e., evidence that is in your client’s favour that the government would not rely on to make their case. 
    - The right to know the case to meet also applies in immigration law. As the Supreme Court summarized in *Charkaoui v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2007 SCC 9](https://canlii.ca/t/1qljj){:target="\_blank"} at para 53: 
        - “[A] fair hearing requires that the affected person be informed of the case against him or her, and be permitted to respond to that case.  This right is well established in immigration law. The question is whether the procedures “provide an adequate opportunity for [an affected person] to **state his case and know the case he has to meet**” (Singh at 213).   
    - The new IRB "*Chairperson Guideline 2: Detention*" has significantly clarified the disclosure obligation. The CBSA must disclose all of the relevant information, and not just facts that they are relying on in their argument for detention (see *Guideline 2* at 7.3.4).
    - This expanded **scope of disclosure** was clarified by the Federal Court of Appeal in ***Brown v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***, [2020 FCA 130 (CanLII)](https://canlii.ca/t/j93cf){:target="\_blank"} at para 142, where the Court stated,
        - The need for detainees to know the case against them creates a disclosure obligation. To be meaningful, the disclosure obligation cannot be limited to information on which the Minister intends to rely. **All relevant information must be disclosed, including information that is only to the advantage of the detainee.**
    - When you are retained by your client after the 48-hour detention review it is important that you reach out to get all previous disclosures from CBSA as well as any other relevant evidence they have in their possession.  If you are retained prior to the 48-hour review, you will want to ensure that you get the Minister’s disclosure before the hearing. If you do not receive sufficient disclosure, you can go to the hearing and argue that the **Minister has not met his burden to continue detention**.
    - write a sample letter to CBSA. For the accessible and downloadable version of this letter, [click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v7Mkqt-fjBr7rWR5VOXFgdmyj4SvEqd3/view?usp=sharing){:target="\_blank"}.

??? note "Putting Together a Release Plan"

    - Start from the position that **release should be granted as soon as possible and with the least onerous conditions available**, in keeping with the guidance of the Supreme Court of Canada in *R v Antic*, [2017 SCC 27](https://canlii.ca/t/h41w4){:target="\_blank"} at para 29,
        - *The ladder principle generally requires that a justice not order a more onerous form of release unless the Crown shows why a less onerous form is inappropriate.* 
    - If the issue is just flight risk, you will want a plan that addresses and mitigates the reasons that the detainee has missed past appointments, or CBSA’s belief that they might go underground if ordered deported based on what they fear in their home country. This is best **remedied by a bondsperson** taking responsibility for ensuring they comply with the release plan.  
    - If the ground for detention is that your client is a danger to the public, you may need a more detailed release plan that would mitigate any risk such as counselling or addictions treatment. Frequently, mental health or addiction issues are present in these cases. You may want to find and reach out to a community agency who can provide support and whose programming your client agrees to attend. Some other possible plans that could reduce the risk of "danger" are more frequent voice or email reporting to CBSA, living with a specific close friend or relative, a curfew, not communicating with certain individuals who have led to problems in the past, or ankle monitoring.
    - A longer list of potential release conditions can be found in *Guideline 2* at **3.2.2**.

??? note "Finding a Bondsperson"

    - At the centre of most release plans is the **bondsperson**. This is a person who has agreed to vouch for the detainee with a deposit of money (called a “**cash bond**") or a guarantee to pay an amount of money if a detainee is released and does not follow the agreed upon conditions (called a “**performance bond**”). 
    - The following are important requirements that must be satisfied when putting forward a bondsperson. 
        - **PR and Residence**: In order to put up a performance bond, the Bondsperson must be a **citizen** or **permanent resident** of Canada who is over **18 years old**.
        - **Responsibility and Influence**: The bondsperson must **know** the person in detention and be willing and able to take responsibility to ensure that the person concerned will **comply** with conditions of release. The strongest bondsperson is someone who is **close enough** to be able to exert influence on the detainee but **not so close** that they would put the detainee’s interests before their own.
        - **Meaningful bonds**: To determine what is a meaningful **amount**, the Member will look at the **person’s income, savings, assets and living expenses**. Another consideration when you are determining what amount to put forward as a proposed bond is the **seriousness** of the danger/flight risk.
            - For a performance bond in particular, the **general rule** is that the person’s income (less liabilities) and assets (minus liabilities) are at least **three times** the amount of the performance bond.
            - It is **illegal** for the money to be coming from the detainee or for the detainee to be reimbursing the bondsperson if the bond is ultimately forfeited.
            - This type of **crowdsourcing** reduces the impact of paying the bond on the bondsperson and, as a result, **it is less likely to be considered a meaningful bond amount**.     
        - **Suitability of Bondsperson**: several factors to decide whether they believe the bondsperson is suitable,
            - Whether the bondsperson has been **aware** of and/or facilitated the detainee’s lack of compliance in the past
            - Whether the bondsperson has a **criminal** record
            - whether they were **successful** or not in ensuring compliance for the detainee
            - Whether the person can adequately **supervise** the detainee
            - Whether they appear to take the position seriously and whether they **understand** what they are getting themselves into
        - **Supervision Plan**: The supervision plan should address the nature of the risks that the bondsperson is meant to offset. For example, you should make sure your bondsperson knows: 
            - How they are going to keep tabs on the person concerned (e.g., will the person concerned live with them? Will they check in by video call regularly?). 
            - What they will do if the person concerned is not listening or cooperating (typically the bondsperson should understand that they will have to speak to them and, if need be, report them to the CBSA). 
            - How are they going to make sure that the person concerned shows up to report to CBSA/appears for hearings/appears for removal. (E.g., do they have a car? Will they go with them to appointments? etc.). 
            - Are other people going to play a role in the supervision of the person concerned (either multiple bondspeople or other support people).  If so – how are they going to communicate and work together?  If there are multiple people who are going to play a role in the supervision of the person concerned, you will want to make sure that they have met and communicated in advance of the hearing. 

??? note "Relevant Questions for the Bondsperson"

    - What is your name? How is it written on your ID? 
    - Are you a Canadian citizen or permanent resident? 
    - What is your address and telephone number? 
    - How do you know the detainee and for how long? Where and when did you meet? 
    - Have you helped the detainee in the past when they were underground? 
    - When was the last time that you saw/spoke to the detainee? Have you visited the detainee since they were detained? Phone contact? How often?
    - Can the detainee live with you after their release? Is there room? Who else lives there? 
    - How far do you live from where the person will be living? How often do you plan to have contact? 
    - Do you know what is going on with the detainee’s case/status? Are you aware of their history with Immigration?  Do you know if they have any criminal charges or convictions? 
    - What is your occupation and annual salary? How long have you been at that job? 
    - Can you get a T-4 from your employer? 
    - Are you self employed? 
    - If you are self-employed, have you filed taxes? Can you get last year’s Notice of Assessment? 
    - Do you have property? Own a house? Can you bring bank statement or house deed? Is there anyone else listed on the deed? (NOTE: they will also have to sign the bond that is based on the property) How much of a mortgage do you have? 
    - Do you have any savings? What do your monthly expenses typically total?
    - Have you ever posted a bond before? When? What is the status of that bond? 
    - Do you have a criminal record? 
    - How much can you post for a cash bond? (Give a range.) 
    - How much are you willing to sign for a performance bond? (Give a range.)
    - Do you understand what your role will be as a bondsperson? 
    - How will you supervise the detainee?  What will you do if they are not cooperating/listening to you? 
    - Can you attend the detention review? (Typically the bondsperson will appear virtually).  

??? note "Six Common Bond-Related Questions"

    - Why is a bond required?
        - Bonds may be required as **an alternative to detention** and as a means of making sure that **the conditions of release are followed**. For example, a bond can help to make sure that the person will appear for appointments, hearings or interviews regarding removal with Immigration. They can also make sure they advise Immigration of their address before they move. The Member of the Immigration and Refugee Board makes the decision about release at the detention review and determines the amount and type of bond required for release. The person who is offering the bond can suggest what amount they can pay and then the Member will decide if it is enough.
    - When must the bond be paid?
        - A Member at the detention review can either make an “Order for Release” or an order for continued detention. **If a release order is made, the bondsperson has until the next detention review to pay the bond, either 7 or 30 days.** **The detainee will not be released until the bonds are paid/signed**. 
    - How do I pay the bonds?
        - Security deposits (also known as **cash bonds**) can be paid by credit card (MasterCard or Visa only), debit card, certified cheque, money order or bank draft payable to: The Receiver General of Canada.
        - To show eligibility for guarantees (also known as performance bonds), the bondsperson must present proof of employment in the form of **a T4 slip or Notice of Assessment** from Revenue Canada if they are self-employed. For every $3000 the bondsperson earns after taxes, they can sign for a $1,000 performance bond. It is also possible to present evidence of liquid assets such as bank savings, convertible stocks or bonds, and real estate (house/condominium deed).
    - When will my bonds be refunded?
        - Immigration can hold the money for years in some cases. Your cash bond will be refunded (or your performance bond nullified) **6-8 weeks after the case has been completed**, provided the conditions have not been violated. In cases where the individual is ordered to leave the country, you must make sure that they register with Immigration officials in the airport prior to boarding their flight to get a “**certificate of departure**”. If the person is granted approval to remain permanently in Canada, the practice of the CBSA is to consider the case complete after the person is granted permanent resident status. This could take up to 24 months after a positive decision is given in a refugee claim or a PRRA. It may be possible to argue that under s.49(3) of the Regulations, the deposit should be returned when the person gets protected person status because they have complied with all of the conditions in their Order for Release. There is no statutory authority to make the bondsperson wait until the person receives permanent resident status.
    - How can I be relieved from the bond obligation?
        - If you no longer want to be responsible for the person who has been released, you should call the CBSA or the ID to advise them. You will have to give their name, date of birth, and 8- or 10-digit immigration client identity number. This may be because you think that the person who was released will not comply with the conditions, or that you need your money back. Immigration will not always relieve you of your promise just because you ask them to. Immigration can require you to bring the person in to Immigration or that another, suitable bondsperson is proposed to take your place. Immigration can ask why you want to be relieved of your obligations. Your explanation could affect the person’s ability to be released into the care of another bondsperson. **If no alternative bondsperson is found, the person will likely be returned to detention.**
    - **Estreat** the bonds
        - Immigration will estreat a bond if the person concerned did not comply with any condition of their release. Estreat means that they will **take the cash** or move to **enforce a promise to pay a performance bond**. For example, the person concerned may not have appeared for an appointment with Immigration or they may not have left the country by a set date. As the bondsperson, it was your responsibility to ensure the person concerned complied with the conditions of release, so Immigration is now holding you responsible. You can respond to Immigration’s decision to estreat your bonds by writing a letter and explaining why you believe you should not be held responsible for the violations in the conditions of release. You may want to get legal representation for this.

??? note "Putting Together a Comprehensive Release Plan"

    - A list of some potential release conditions can be found in *Guideline 2* at 3.2.2. 
    - There are also **standard conditions** that are applied in most cases by the Immigration Division.
        - **Appear** whenever required by CBSA or the Immigration Division, including for removal; 
        - Provide CBSA with a **travel document** or cooperate with CBSA in obtaining a travel document. 
    - If the person is a danger to the public, the standard terms and conditions will likely also include: 
        - to **not commit** criminal offences 
        - to **report** criminal charges or convictions to CBSA 
        - to not possess or use a **firearm** or other weapon 

??? note "CBSA-Controlled Alternatives to Detention"

    - The CBSA controls programs that can form key parts of a proposed alternative to detention. Example programs are the **Toronto Bail Program** (TBP), **the Salvation Army**, and the **John Howard Society**. The Immigration Division will almost always allow release for a client who has been accepted into one of these programs.
    - The CBSA also provides **ankle monitoring** programs in some regions.
    - When crafting a release plan, you want to make sure that you are addressing the individual risks in your case. The plan that you put forward should address any previous concerns outlined in previous decisions as well as those that are raised by the Minister’s counsel. 

??? note "Disclosure Prior to the Hearing"

    - If important facts are based on hearsay, get ready to note that in submissions. Where such a fact is central, consider asking the CBSA to have the primary source of the information at the hearing to testify and if they refuse, ask ID for a summons requiring the person from whom the information derives to come to the hearing pursuant to Rule 33 of the ID rules. See *Guideline 2* at 7.3.3
    - According to Rule 26 of the Immigration Division Rules, disclosure must be provided at least **five days** before the hearing for the 30-day detention review. If you are late, you must request the admission of the evidence explaining why it could not be provided earlier, and the relevance and probative value of the documents.
    - For the initial 48-hour and 7-day detention reviews, the rules specify that disclosure is simply “**as soon as possible**” given the short time frame for these proceedings.
    - If you are calling a witness, this must be done in accordance with Rule 32(1) of the ID Rules and your disclosure cover should also include the witness information required by the Rules (purpose of the testimony, relationship between witness and detainee, expected time for testimony).
