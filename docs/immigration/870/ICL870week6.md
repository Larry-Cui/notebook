# Module 6: Preparing for the Detention Review 

## Notes

??? note "Tutorial notes"

    - Wednesday 4:00pm.

??? note "Where to Start"

    - Navigate the anxiety of friends and family
        - As you have already learned, detention reviews happen 48 hours after detention, 7 days after detention, and then every 30 days after that. Although it is understandable that a detained person or their family may want you to attend a review as soon as possible, it is important to make sure you have all the facts. Once you are prepared and have everything together, you can even request an **early detention review**. 
    - Establish contact with the client
        - In your initial conversation with your client, the first thing to make clear is the terms of your retainer – i.e., what are they hiring you to do.
    - Get the information you need
        - Remember that people don’t always have the best or most accurate memory of every event in their life. At the same time, CBSA’s file may contain false information. You will have to dig down and use your instincts to get to the truth. 
    - Procure the client's signature
        - Here's an example [cover letter](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1h-kxiefQEX-HSORKq2OUcjVrWAN-kk99/view?usp=sharing){:target="\_blank"} to the Immigration Holding Center (IHC).
        - To Whom It May Concern: I am in the process of being retained by Mr. Mohammed Raeesi. I believe he is in room 223. Please kindly assist him in signing and dating the attached Use of a Representative form at Section D at the bottom of the second page beside where I have marked and then returning this to me as soon as possible. Thank you for your assistance. Sincerely, The Immigration Justice League

??? note "Obtaining Relevant Information"

    - A foundational principle of natural justice is **the right to know the case to meet**. The government has an obligation to share even “**exculpatory**” evidence — i.e., evidence that is in your client’s favour that the government would not rely on to make their case. 
    - The right to know the case to meet also applies in immigration law. As the Supreme Court summarized in *Charkaoui v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2007 SCC 9](https://canlii.ca/t/1qljj){:target="\_blank"} at para 53: 
        - “[A] fair hearing requires that the affected person be informed of the case against him or her, and be permitted to respond to that case.  This right is well established in immigration law. The question is whether the procedures “provide an adequate opportunity for [an affected person] to **state his case and know the case he has to meet**” (Singh at 213).   
    - The new IRB "*Chairperson Guideline 2: Detention*" has significantly clarified the disclosure obligation. The CBSA must disclose all of the relevant information, and not just facts that they are relying on in their argument for detention (see *Guideline 2* at 7.3.4).
    - This expanded **scope of disclosure** was clarified by the Federal Court of Appeal in ***Brown v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***, [2020 FCA 130 (CanLII)](https://canlii.ca/t/j93cf){:target="\_blank"} at para 142, where the Court stated,
        - The need for detainees to know the case against them creates a disclosure obligation. To be meaningful, the disclosure obligation cannot be limited to information on which the Minister intends to rely. **All relevant information must be disclosed, including information that is only to the advantage of the detainee.**
    - When you are retained by your client after the 48-hour detention review it is important that you reach out to get all previous disclosures from CBSA as well as any other relevant evidence they have in their possession.  If you are retained prior to the 48-hour review, you will want to ensure that you get the Minister’s disclosure before the hearing. If you do not receive sufficient disclosure, you can go to the hearing and argue that the **Minister has not met his burden to continue detention**.
    - write a sample letter to CBSA. For the accessible and downloadable version of this letter, [click here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1v7Mkqt-fjBr7rWR5VOXFgdmyj4SvEqd3/view?usp=sharing){:target="\_blank"}.

??? note "Putting Together a Release Plan"

    - Start from the position that **release should be granted as soon as possible and with the least onerous conditions available**, in keeping with the guidance of the Supreme Court of Canada in *R v Antic*, [2017 SCC 27](https://canlii.ca/t/h41w4){:target="\_blank"} at para 29,
        - *The ladder principle generally requires that a justice not order a more onerous form of release unless the Crown shows why a less onerous form is inappropriate.* 
    - If the issue is just flight risk, you will want a plan that addresses and mitigates the reasons that the detainee has missed past appointments, or CBSA’s belief that they might go underground if ordered deported based on what they fear in their home country. This is best **remedied by a bondsperson** taking responsibility for ensuring they comply with the release plan.  
    - If the ground for detention is that your client is a danger to the public, you may need a more detailed release plan that would mitigate any risk such as counselling or addictions treatment. Frequently, mental health or addiction issues are present in these cases. You may want to find and reach out to a community agency who can provide support and whose programming your client agrees to attend. Some other possible plans that could reduce the risk of "danger" are more frequent voice or email reporting to CBSA, living with a specific close friend or relative, a curfew, not communicating with certain individuals who have led to problems in the past, or ankle monitoring.
    - A longer list of potential release conditions can be found in *Guideline 2* at **3.2.2**.

???+ note "Finding a Bondsperson"

    - At the centre of most release plans is the **bondsperson**. This is a person who has agreed to vouch for the detainee with a deposit of money (called a “**cash bond**") or a guarantee to pay an amount of money if a detainee is released and does not follow the agreed upon conditions (called a “**performance bond**”). 
    - The following are important requirements that must be satisfied when putting forward a bondsperson. 
        - PR and Residence: In order to put up a performance bond, the Bondsperson must be a citizen or permanent resident of Canada who is over 18 years old.
        - Responsibility and Influence:
