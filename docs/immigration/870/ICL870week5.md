??? note "Grounds for Detention"

    - Immigration detention is an administrative (not criminal) process. It involves the state holding non-citizens (foreign nationals and permanent residents) in custody. Detainees can be held in custody in jails (even where they have never committed a crime) and immigration holding centres.
    - The Immigration Division holds hearings, called “detention reviews”, at regularly prescribed intervals where the Minister must show that detention continues to be required.
    - two parts of the analysis that occur in every detention review: 
        - Step 1: is there a ground for detention (IRPA 55, 58; IRPR 245-247; other factors)? 
        - Step 2: if so, is detention justified (s. 248 IRPR)?   
    - While the Immigration Division does have authority to detain an individual under **s. 58(2)** of the Act, in almost all circumstances it is **a CBSA officer** who first detains a person for immigration purposes.  Section **55(1)** of the Act sets out the grounds on which a CBSA officer can **issue a warrant** for the arrest and detention of any non-citizen - including permanent residents. 
    - Section **55(2)** sets out the grounds on which a foreign national (other than a protected person) can be detained **without a warrant**.These grounds do not apply to permanent residents of Canada.
    - CBSA officers also have the ability to detain any non-citizen **upon their arrival** into Canada (either by land or by air).  These grounds are set out in **s. 55(3)** of the IRPA. At subsection 55(3) of the Act, we see the power of arrest for **examination or investigation**, which applies to all non-citizens equally, including to permanent residents and protected persons. This arrest power is often referred to as the **“Ministerial inquiry” ground of detention**. 
    - The Minister also has authority under **s. 20.1** of the IRPA to designate groups of persons arriving in Canada as “**designated foreign nationals**”. This provision covers situations where an officer believes that there has been human smuggling or where the officer cannot conduct an examination of a group of people (e.g., for identity/admissibility) in a timely manner. In these circumstances, an officer can designate the group to be “designated foreign nationals”. One consequence of this designation, stipulated at ss. 55(3.1) and 56(2) of the IRPA is **mandatory detention**.

???+ note "Scenarios for Release"

    - Once a person is arrested and detained under section 55 of the Act, there are two potential scenarios for release: 
        - **Release by a CBSA Officer.**  Subsection 56(1) of the Act provides that, within the first 48 hours, the detainee can be released by an Officer (i.e., by the CBSA), who can also impose any conditions of release deemed necessary.  Although it is less common, counsel may be called upon by a client (especially if it is an existing client) to assist with release negotiations with a CBSA officer right after their client has been detained.  In such circumstances, you would want to discuss with the CBSA officer why the person’s detention should not be continued and/or put together a release plan if possible and negotiate release terms and conditions.  
        - **Release by the Immigration Division.**  Subsection 56(1) also provides that once the Immigration Division holds its first detention review, which must occur within the first 48 hours of detention, it is then only the Immigration Division that can order release or continued detention.  This is the stage where counsel most often gets involved and will be the focus of the rest of this module.   
    - The **Minister bears the burden** of establishing on **a balance of probabilities** that detention should be continued.  In practice, this is a two-step process.  
        - First, the Minister must demonstrate that at least one of the enumerated grounds under s. 58 has been established.  Indeed, s. 58 mandates that the Division must order release of a person unless it is satisfied that at least one of the enumerated grounds for detention has been made out. 
        - Once the Minister establishes a ground for detention, the Division must then assess each of the factors set out in **s. 248** of the Regulations (referred to as “the s. 248 factors”). In most instances a detained person will be released pursuant to this part of the analysis, not because the Division finds that a ground for detention does not exist.
