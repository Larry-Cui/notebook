??? note "Introduction"

    - Immigration detention is an administrative (not criminal) process. It involves the state holding non-citizens (foreign nationals and permanent residents) in custody. Detainees can be held in custody in jails (even where they have never committed a crime) and immigration holding centres.
    - The Immigration Division holds hearings, called “detention reviews”, at regularly prescribed intervals where the Minister must show that detention continues to be required.
