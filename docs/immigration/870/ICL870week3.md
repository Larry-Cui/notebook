??? note "Jurisdiction and Discretion of the IAD"

    - [***Revell v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***](https://canlii.ca/t/j2xtn){:target="\_blank"}, 2019 FCA 262 (specifically para 5–12) for a good explanation and account of the **discretion of the Minister to refer a foreign national (FN) to the ID**, the alternatives and avenues open to an inadmissible FN to remain in Canada. 
        - [6] ... However, even if the Minister is of the opinion that the report of the CBSA officer is well-founded, he or she still retains some discretion not to refer it to the ID (see, notably, [*Tran v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness)*](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2017/2017scc50/2017scc50.html#par6){:target="\_blank"}, 2017 SCC 50, [2017] 2 S.C.R. 289 (Tran), at paragraph 6).
        - [8] If the foreign national who has been found inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality or organized criminality wishes to remain in Canada, **three avenues** remain open to them: a **temporary residence permit**, **a humanitarian and compassionate discretionary exemption**, and **a Ministerial declaration**. **Section 24** allows foreign nationals found inadmissible to apply to an officer for an exceptional temporary resident permit allowing them to remain in Canada for a finite period of time.
        - [9] **Section 25** allows foreign nationals found inadmissible to apply to the Minister of Citizenship and Immigration for a discretionary exemption from their inadmissibility on humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) grounds. Unlike the temporary residence permit, the exemption allows them to remain in Canada permanently. Although it is available to foreign nationals who are inadmissible for subsection 36(1) serious criminality irrespective of their sentence, it is not available to those who are inadmissible under subsection 37(1) organized criminality.
        - [10] **Section 42.1** provides that the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness may declare that subsection 37(1) organized criminality does not constitute inadmissibility in respect of a foreign national if he or she is satisfied that this exception is not contrary to the national interest.
        - [11] Before a removal order is enforced, a foreign national can apply for a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA) (**sections 112–113**). 
        - [12] While section 48 of the Act directs that removal orders be enforced as soon as possible, the person concerned may request that it be deferred. CBSA retains a limited discretion to defer (see [*Lewis v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness)*](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fca/doc/2017/2017fca130/2017fca130.html#par54){:target="\_blank"}, 2017 FCA 130, [2018] 2 F.C.R. 229 (Lewis), at paragraph 54).
    - [***Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Solmaz***](https://canlii.ca/t/j8w7d){:target="\_blank"}, 2020 FCA 126 and note that charges not proved beyond a reasonable doubt can still be used to establish the necessary elements. See para 23 - there can be a finding of inadmissibility, notwithstanding an acquittal. 
        - [23] Furthermore, the IAD notes that although the offence giving rise to the removal order is the only one for which the respondent has been convicted, this is not his only experience with the criminal justice system. In this regard, it identifies, based on police reports produced by the Minister, four incidents, occurring between June 2007 and April 2010, of domestic violence and intra-family conflicts involving the respondent’s former in-laws. In one case, charges of assault were allegedly laid against the respondent, then withdrawn. In another, he was acquitted of charges of making death threats against his former spouse and members of her family. In the other two cases, he was not summoned to stand trial.

??? note "Representing your Client before the IAD in Review"

    - **Burden of proof on appellant**
        - You are responsible for providing the relevant information to the Member
        - It is not the Member’s responsibility to ask for documents or ask questions about topics that you have failed to address
        - You must prove your client’s case on the required standard of proof: **a balance of probabilities**
    - **Documentary evidence**
        - The disclosure deadline is **20 days in advance** of the hearing
        - If your documents are late, explain why they are late and how they are relevant
        - If the Minister’s counsel objects to late documents, **suggest a recess and/or adjournment**
        - Format of documents: 8.5/11 paper, pagination, indices, translations and translator’s declaration
        - Include a list of proposed witnesses in your cover letter: name, address, and telephone number
    - **Disclosure documents in H and C**
        - Tailor your evidence to the factors for consideration for your specific type of removal order appeal (e.g., **H&C**)
        - Address **establishment** (e.g., economic-, familial-, and community involvement)
        - Example documents for establishment: job letters, Notice of Assessment as proof of tax payments, letters of support from friends and family
        - Address hardship (for your client and their family)
        - Example documents for hardship:
            - Letters of support from family in Canada
            - Evidence of adverse conditions in the country of origin (e.g., economic conditions, gender issues, availability of mental health care, etc.)
            - Best interests of a child (e.g., birth certificates, photos, school documents)
        - Don’t take anything for granted. Provide proof for all statements.
        - Address personal circumstances (e.g., mental health issues, addictions, history of abuse)
    - Oral evidence
        - Question your client and other witnesses
        - Address factors for consideration
        - Address personal circumstances

???+ note "Reliable and Probative Evidence Before the IAD"

    - **Credibility** relates to a witness's sincerity, whether she is speaking the truth as she believes it to. It includes both veracity (i.e. a witness’s honesty) and reliability (i.e. assuming the witness is being honest, whether the evidence provides an accurate account of the material facts).
    - **Reliability** relates to the accuracy of the evidence in question. 
    - The **probative** value of evidence is its capacity to establish the fact which it is offered to prove (in other words, the degree to which the information is useful in answering a question that must be addressed). Not all evidence is equally helpful in assisting a decision-maker to make findings; each piece of evidence must be weighed. 
    - To “weigh” a piece of evidence means to assess its credibility and probative value. In Magonza, the Federal Court wrote that evidentiary weight can be expressed using the following equation:
        - **weight = (credibility) x (probative value)**
        The case of *Magonza* further defines other key concepts in this area. See [***Magonza v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***](https://canlii.ca/t/hwz13){:target="\_blank"}, 2019 FC 14 
    - Medical Inadmissibility: [***Doss v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***](https://canlii.ca/t/jhjtv){:target="\_blank"}, 2020 CanLII 107062 at para 9 - 11
    - Criminality Inadmissibility: [***Dembo v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness)***](https://canlii.ca/t/jbfb3){:target="\_blank"}, 2020 CanLII 84433 (CA IRB) at para 10 - 21
        - [21] Based on the foregoing, the Panel finds that the lack of establishment far outweighs the number of years spent in Canada. As such, the Panel finds that this factor carries significant negative weight in its assessment of special measures.
    - Residency Obligation Appeal: [***Oyelade v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness)***](https://canlii.ca/t/jdd86){:target="\_blank"}, 2020 CanLII 112378 (CA IRB) at paras 7 -9, 11, 13-15 and 18 -20
        -  The Appellant’s wife and two children are currently living in Ottawa. Unfortunately, they provided no testimony or evidence to help me gain a better understanding of the impact on them if the Appellant is not permitted to retain his permanent residency. This is a significant shortcoming in the evidence.
    - Expression of Remorse in an IAD appeal
        - [***Liu v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness)***](https://canlii.ca/t/hqshw){:target="\_blank"}, 2017 CanLII 98345 (CA IRB) at paras 18-22, 25
