??? note "Inadmissible on Criminality"

    - **Case Study "Dae Kim":** Dae Kim, is a citizen of South Korea. He wants to apply for a study permit to enroll in the Baker/Patissier Apprentice Program at George Brown College in Toronto. He was convicted in South Korea of shoplifting in **June 2018** and was sentenced to one year’s probation. He has no other convictions.
        - 1. Identify the equivalent offence under Canadian law.
            - The elements of Dae’s offence in his home country are equivalent to an offence known informally as “theft” under s 322, s 334(b)(ii) of the Criminal Code. It is a **hybrid offence** that may be prosecuted **either summarily or by indictment**.
        - 2. Is he inadmissible?
            - He is inadmissible to Canada, because hybrid offences are deemed indictable for immigration purposes. section 36(2)(b) of the IRPA.
        - 3. What remedy is available for him?
            - Under s. 36(3)(c), Dae is **eligible to apply for rehabilitation only after June 2024**, five years after the completion of the imposed sentence. Remember that probation is considered part of a sentence or a conviction, and thus, Dae must count **five years from the end of the probation period**, which is June 2019.
    - **Case Study "Rosaria Marques":** Rosaria Marques is a citizen of Guatemala. She wants to attend her niece’s wedding in Montreal. In 2010, she was convicted of operating a motor vehicle while impaired in her native country.  She did not serve any time in prison but had to pay a fine. She has no other convictions.
        - 1. Identify the equivalent offence under Canadian law.
            - In Canada, the equivalent is operation while impaired which is a criminal offence under section 320.14(1) of the Criminal Code and is listed as a **hybrid offence**.
        - 2. Is she inadmissible?
            - Yes. She is inadmissible pursuant section 36(2)(b) of the IRPA.
        - What remedy is available for her?
            - Rosaria must apply at the Canadian visa office for **individual rehabilitation**. If she is successful, this would cure her inadmissibility, not only for the purpose of attending the wedding, but also for the future. Another option is to apply for a **TRP**. A TRP may be issued for the duration of few days so she can attend the wedding. However, If she wishes to re-enter Canada at another time in the future, she will have to re-apply.

??? note "Inadmissible on “Failing to Comply”"

    - Mario and Elena were reported to immigration and had to appear for a Minister’s Delegate Review where a finding of inadmissibility was made against them for “**failing to comply**” by **working without a valid work permit and remaining in Canada after their TRVs expired**.
    - **Option 1:** Mario and Elena may apply for a **Temporary Resident Permit**. A foreign national who is admitted to Canada and then becomes inadmissible may apply for a TRP from within Canada (IRPA s. 24(1)) - no matter what type of inadmissibility has been found. A TRP will be issued only in compelling circumstances because it is an extraordinary measure.
        - It must be noted that Mario should not apply for an extension because his work permit has already expired.
        - Moreover, Mario and Elena are not eligible to apply for restoration of status because they were found inadmissible.
    - Instructor's Note: TRPs provide flexibility to address exceptional circumstances but they are always issued at the **discretion of the Minister**.  There must be a compelling need for the individual to remain in Canada, and this need must be compelling sufficient to overcome or outweigh any risk to Canada and Canadians that the individual may pose by being allowed to remain.
    - Note that **even if a TRP is issued, Mario and Elena are still considered to be inadmissible and in non-compliance**. They will still be expected to comply with any conditions imposed.
    - **Option 2:** Mario and Elena may also apply for relief for exceptional cases under **section 25 of the IRPA**. The H&C class provides the Minister with the discretion to **exempt foreign nationals from the ordinary requirements** of the law and to **grant permanent residence** to applicants who would otherwise not be able to meet statutory and regulatory criteria.
