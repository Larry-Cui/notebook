??? note "Five Tips on how to Conduct an Admissibility Hearing"

    - Prepare, prepare, prepare!
        - Preparing your client 
            - Tell your client what the hearing will be like
            - Set your client at ease by explaining the process
            - Prepare your client on how to answer (hard) questions (e.g., no guessing and ask for clarifications)
        - Preparing the documentation
            - Your documentation must support your case and respond to the Minster’s case  
            - Your documentation must be **relevant**, **timely** and from **reliable** sources  
            - If your documentation does not meet the standards of relevance, timeliness or reliability, you need to explain why 
    - Know the ID rules and follow them
        - What’s covered by the rules:
            - **Disclosure deadlines**
            - How the disclosure should be submitted (e.g., page numbers and indices)
            - Rules on **witnesses** (e.g., how you can call them)
            - How to make an application to **change the date** of a hearing
        - Failure to abide by rules could result in:
            - Your disclosure not being accepted
            - A witness not being allowed
            - An application being denied
            - You looking sloppy and developing a bad reputation
    - Recognize the tribunal's jurisdiction
        - Do not form arguments outside the tribunal’s jurisdiction
        - Focus on ground of **inadmissibility at issue**, addressing each component of that ground
        - Address **problematic evidence**
    - Keep the other side in check
        - Remain engaged throughout the hearing
        - Object if questioning becomes abusive
        - Clarify if something has been misstated
        - Listen to the Minister and address what they say in your submissions 
    - Listen to the Member and answer their questions directly
        - **Focus** on what the Member is interested in
        - Get the Member on your side by being **amenable** to their requests

???+ note "Inadmissibility Reports"

    - A person who is already in Canada is inadmissible, the officer writes an **inadmissibility report ("Section 44(1) report")**.
    - The officer then forwards the report to the minister's delegate, who either **issue a removal order** directly, or **refer it to the ID**.

    !!! note ""

        **228(1.1):** For the purposes of subsection 44(2) of the Act, and subject to subsection (4), if a foreign national is the subject of a report and the following circumstances apply, the report shall not be referred to the Immigration Division and the removal order made shall be an exclusion order:

        - (a) an officer directed the foreign national to return temporarily to the United States under section 41; and
        - (b) the foreign national is inadmissible under paragraph 41(a) of the Act for failing to establish that they will leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay.

    - IRCC officer generally writes a 44(1) report. But when it's about security, human rights issue, organized criminality, CBSA will manage the case.
    - The federal court in ***Hernandez v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)***, [2005 FC 429](https://canlii.ca/t/1k2fj){:target="\_blank"} concluded that the scope of discretion under ss 44(1) and (2) is broad to **allow consideration of H&C**. 
    - **Onus of Proof:** at an admissibility hearing the onus of proof **depends on whether the person concerned (PC) has legal status in Canada.** 
        - if the PC was denied the right to enter Canada, and therefore has no legal status, the onus is on the PC to prove they are not inadmissible
        - if the PC was allowed to enter Canada and is alleged at a later time to have become inadmissible, then the onus is on the hearings officer to prove those allegations.
