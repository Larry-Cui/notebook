    - The officer then forwards the report to the minister's delegate, who either **issue a removal order** directly, or **refer it to the ID**.

    ??? note "**228(1) of IRPR** (infractions for which a removal order can be made by a minster's delegate)"

    !!! note ""

        **228(1.1):** For the purposes of subsection 44(2) of the Act, and subject to subsection (4), if a foreign national is the subject of a report and the following circumstances apply, the report shall not be referred to the Immigration Division and the removal order made shall be an exclusion order:

        - (a) an officer directed the foreign national to return temporarily to the United States under section 41; and
        - (b) the foreign national is inadmissible under paragraph 41(a) of the Act for failing to establish that they will leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay.

    - IRCC officer generally writes a 44(1) report. But when it's about security, human rights issue, organized criminality, CBSA will manage the case.
    - The federal court in ***Hernandez v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)***, [2005 FC 429](https://canlii.ca/t/1k2fj){:target="\_blank"} concluded that the scope of discretion under ss 44(1) and (2) is broad to **allow consideration of H&C**.
    - **Onus of Proof:** at an admissibility hearing the onus of proof **depends on whether the person concerned (PC) has legal status in Canada.**
        - if the PC was denied the right to enter Canada, and therefore has no legal status, the onus is on the PC to prove they are not inadmissible
        - if the PC was allowed to enter Canada and is alleged at a later time to have become inadmissible, then the onus is on the hearings officer to prove those allegations.
    - **Standard of Proof:** In most cases the standard is "**reasonable grounds to believe**". For section 36(1) of the IRPA, where the permanent residents or foreign nationals are alleged to have "committed an act" outside Canada, the standard is "**on a balance of probabilities**".

??? note "Arrest and Detention"

    - **At the POE**, an officer may arrest and detain a PR or FN to ensure that the person will be available for examination (IRPA s 55(3)(a)), or the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person is inadmissible on any of the most serious grounds of inadmissibility. The officer must notify the ID so that **a detention review can be held within 48 hours** (IRPA s 57(1)).
    - **Wihtin Canada**, generally an office is required to issue **an immigration warrant** for arrest and detention. Within 48 hours of a detention, an officer may review the reasons for the detention and may exercise their authority under s 56(1) of IRPA to release the person. Otherwise, the officer must notify the ID so a review hearing could be held. (IRPA s 55(4)).
    - **A person appearing at an admissibility hearing** may be detained at the end of the hearing.
    - Unless a FN can prove they have the appropriate visa, a FN who is part of a group that is designated irregular arrival will be designated and known as a **DFN** under s 20.1(2) of the IRPA and subject to **automatic detention** if they are 16 years of age or older. (s 56(2))

??? note "The Immigration Division"

    - **Admissibility hearings.** The ID has the authority under s 45 of the IRPA to hear and decide whether PR and FN alleged to have contravened the IRPA should be allowed to **enter or remain in Canada or should be ordered removed**.
    - **Detention reviews.** The ID has the authority under s 54 of the IRPA to **review the reasons for the immigration detention** of PR, FN, and DFN to decide whether to release them or whether there are sufficient reasons to continue the detention.
    - Hearings before an ID member are quasi-judicial proceedings and are **adversarial**.
    - **Family members** who are included in the inadmissibility report may be **subject to the same removal order**.
    - the PC (person concerned) must be **personally in attendance** at the hearing.
    - Generally, the hearing officer (CBSA) first calls the PC. **There is no right against self-incrimination at an admissibility hearing**.
    - s 229(3) of the IRPR directs the ID to make a deportation order instead of the prescribed removal order against a person if the PC meets any of the following criteria:
        - previous subject to a removal order
        - failed to comply with any conditions or obligations imposed under IRPA or legislation
        - convicted in Canada
    - the ID member may make any of the following decisions (s 45 IRPA):
        - allow PC to enter Canada
        - grant status to PC
        - authorize PC to enter Canada for further examination
        - make removal order
    - Counsel may make a **oral request for written reasons** at the end of the hearing or later, **in writing**, provided that the request is made **within 10 days** of the date of the decision. (Rule 7(4))
    - The PC has **no right to appeal** to IAD if the inadmissibility is based on "**security, human rights violation, serious criminality or organized criminality.**" (s 64 IRPA)
    - DFN has no right of appeal to the RAD.
    - The detention review is initiated when the ID receives a **request** for a detention review from the **minister**. The issue of detention may also arise at the end of the inadmissibility hearing, after the member has issued a removal order, if the minister argues that there is a reason to place the PC in detention.
    - There is **no limit** to the amount of time that a person may be in **immigration detention** as long as there is a periodic review.
    - The Ontario Court of Appeal (***Wang v Canada***, [2018 ONCA 798](https://canlii.ca/t/hvd7t){:target="\_blank"} at 23, 33) has ruled that immigration detainees can apply for ***hebeas corpus*** to challenge their incarceration in situations that amount to "indefinite detention" under the Charter.
    - The time for ID to review the reasons for a continued detention (A 57(1) & (2)):
        - the initial review: 48 hours of detention
        - the second review: 7 days of first detention
        - subsequent review: 30 days following each of the previous review
    - A **DFN under 16 years** of age is excluded from the detention.
    - Detention reviews for **PR** who are being held under a **security certificate** are conducted by the **federal court**, not the ID (A82). **48 hours** for the initial review and **6 months** following the previous review.
    - Detention reviews before the ID are adversarial hearings.
    - Factors to be considered if a PC should be detained (R 244):
        - flight risk
        - danger to the public
        - identity not established, and
        - other factors (R248, 249)

??? note "Removal"

    - **Canadian citizen are not subject to removal.** The only situation in which a citizen may be removed from Canada is if their citizenship is first **revoked**. This may happen if the citizenship was granted on the basis of a **misrepresentation**.
    - Family members of a foreign national who is the subject of a removal order may also be included within the order.
    - The type of removal order made against a PC depends on which ground of inadmissibility are found to have been violated. 
        - **departure orders (R224):** no authorization is necessary to return. 30 days to becomes enforceable. require a certificate of departure when leaving.
        - **exclusion orders (R225):** a written authorization is necessary to return during ONE year. Misrepresentation is FIVE years. family member is exempt from period restriction.
        - **deportation orders (R226):** always need an authorization to return. family member is exempt from period restriction. A80 certificate of security is deemed as a removal order and always need an authorization to return.
    - R224(2). If a person **fails to leave** Canada within the 30-day time period, or leaves and **fails to obtain a certificate of departure**, the **departure order is automatically deemed to be a deportation order**. 
    - R229. An exclusion order must be issued by the ID when a person is found to be inadmissible to Canada. The person must apply for an authorization to return within barred period. [How to apply?](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/inadmissibility/reasons/authorization-return-canada/apply.html){:target="\_blank"} and [ARC op1: procedure](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/resources/manuals/op/op01-eng.pdf){:target="\_blank"}
    - **Five ways** a removal may be **stayed**:
        - by the minister
        - by application for leave for a judicial review
        - by application for PRRA
        - by approval on H&C grounds
        - by appeal to IAD
    - Furthermore, if a statutory stay is unavailable, a person can apply to the federal court for a stay of removal pending further judicial review litigation.
    - R230. the minister may not issue a stay of removal order if the person is inadmissible on security, violation of human rights, serious criminality and organized crimes, or a person that **consented in writing** to their removal. 

??? note "Procedural Fairness and ID Rules"

    - ***Cha v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)***, [2006 FCA 126](https://canlii.ca/t/1mz15){:target="\_blank"}
        - The trial Judge quashed this order, finding that the Minister’s delegate had an obligation to consider the particular circumstances of the applicant and his conviction to determine if there were any **mitigating circumstances which would make it unreasonable to deport** him.
        - the appeal should be allowed. Because subsection 44(2) applies to all grounds of inadmissibility, **the scope of discretion may vary** depending on the **grounds** alleged, on whether the **person** concerned is a permanent resident or a foreign national and on whether the report is **referred** or not to the Immigration Division.
        - Parliament has made it clear that criminality of non‑citizens is a major concern. It is their [officer] respective responsibility, when they find a person to be inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality or criminality, to prepare a report and to act on it.
        - A review of the five duty of fairness factors set out in Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) led to the conclusion that the respondent was entitled to a relatively low degree of participatory rights.
        - [42] five factors set out by the Supreme Court of Canada in ***Baker v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)***, [1999 CanLII 699](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1999/1999canlii699/1999canlii699.html){:target="\_blank"}. 
        - [47] the fact is that he came to Canada under a student permit renewable, we were told, every six months, that he was permitted as a matter of privilege to stay in Canada for a certain duration and subject to certain conditions, never had and could never have had any expectation that he would be allowed to remain in Canada and has breached a major condition of his right of entry. This factor points to a lower duty of fairness.
        - [48] Furthermore, even though the issue of inadmissibility has been determined, a foreign national can still seek a stay of the removal order on H&C considerations (section 233 of the Regulations) or in the course of a pre‑removal risk assessment (section 232 of the Regulations). He is therefore not out of the country yet, and not out of remedies. This factor also points to a lower degree of fairness.

Roberto's criminal defense counsel has initiated an appeal of the conviction to the Ontario Court of Appeal. Can Robert's **admissibility hearing be adjourned pending the criminal appeal**? 
        - [ ] No, because the criminal proceeding is not relevant to the admissibility hearing 
        - [x] No, because it is not generally a sufficient reason
        - [ ] Yes, because the criminal appeal takes precedence over immigration admissibility proceedings
        - [ ] Yes, because the conviction is pending appeal, there may not be a basis for Roberto's admissibility hearing if Roberto's criminal appeal is allowed 
    > See Chapter 3, III. The Immigration Division: Admissibility Hearings and Detention Reviews, "Admissibility Hearings – Postponements and Adjournments". According to the Chairperson's guidelines, **the fact that there is a pending appeal of a conviction on criminal charges related to the subject of the proceedings or a pending application for Ministerial relief from inadmissibility is not generally a sufficient reason for the ID to grant an application to change the date or time of an admissibility hearing.**
