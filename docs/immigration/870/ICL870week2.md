??? note "Five Tips on how to Conduct an Admissibility Hearing"

    - Prepare, prepare, prepare!
        - Preparing your client 
            - Tell your client what the hearing will be like
            - Set your client at ease by explaining the process
            - Prepare your client on how to answer (hard) questions (e.g., no guessing and ask for clarifications)
        - Preparing the documentation
            - Your documentation must support your case and respond to the Minster’s case  
            - Your documentation must be **relevant**, **timely** and from **reliable** sources  
            - If your documentation does not meet the standards of relevance, timeliness or reliability, you need to explain why 
    - Know the ID rules and follow them
        - What’s covered by the rules:
            - **Disclosure deadlines**
            - How the disclosure should be submitted (e.g., page numbers and indices)
            - Rules on **witnesses** (e.g., how you can call them)
            - How to make an application to **change the date** of a hearing
        - Failure to abide by rules could result in:
            - Your disclosure not being accepted
            - A witness not being allowed
            - An application being denied
            - You looking sloppy and developing a bad reputation
    - Recognize the tribunal's jurisdiction
        - Do not form arguments outside the tribunal’s jurisdiction
        - Focus on ground of **inadmissibility at issue**, addressing each component of that ground
        - Address **problematic evidence**
    - Keep the other side in check
        - Remain engaged throughout the hearing
        - Object if questioning becomes abusive
        - Clarify if something has been misstated
        - Listen to the Minister and address what they say in your submissions 
    - Listen to the Member and answer their questions directly
        - **Focus** on what the Member is interested in
        - Get the Member on your side by being **amenable** to their requests
