??? note "Five Tips on how to Conduct an Admissibility Hearing"

    - Prepare, prepare, prepare!
        - Preparing your client
            - Tell your client what the hearing will be like
            - Set your client at ease by explaining the process
            - Prepare your client on how to answer (hard) questions (e.g., no guessing and ask for clarifications)
        - Preparing the documentation
            - Your documentation must support your case and respond to the Minster’s case
            - Your documentation must be **relevant**, **timely** and from **reliable** sources
            - If your documentation does not meet the standards of relevance, timeliness or reliability, you need to explain why
    - Know the ID rules and follow them
        - What’s covered by the rules:
            - **Disclosure deadlines**
            - How the disclosure should be submitted (e.g., page numbers and indices)
            - Rules on **witnesses** (e.g., how you can call them)
            - How to make an application to **change the date** of a hearing
        - Failure to abide by rules could result in:
            - Your disclosure not being accepted
            - A witness not being allowed
            - An application being denied
            - You looking sloppy and developing a bad reputation
    - Recognize the tribunal's jurisdiction
        - Do not form arguments outside the tribunal’s jurisdiction
        - Focus on ground of **inadmissibility at issue**, addressing each component of that ground
        - Address **problematic evidence**
    - Keep the other side in check
        - Remain engaged throughout the hearing
        - Object if questioning becomes abusive
        - Clarify if something has been misstated
        - Listen to the Minister and address what they say in your submissions
    - Listen to the Member and answer their questions directly
        - **Focus** on what the Member is interested in
        - Get the Member on your side by being **amenable** to their requests

??? note "Inadmissibility Reports"

    - A person who is already in Canada is inadmissible, the officer writes an **inadmissibility report ("Section 44(1) report")**.
    - The officer then forwards the report to the minister's delegate, who either **issue a removal order** directly, or **refer it to the ID**.

    !!! note ""

        **228(1.1):** For the purposes of subsection 44(2) of the Act, and subject to subsection (4), if a foreign national is the subject of a report and the following circumstances apply, the report shall not be referred to the Immigration Division and the removal order made shall be an exclusion order:

        - (a) an officer directed the foreign national to return temporarily to the United States under section 41; and
        - (b) the foreign national is inadmissible under paragraph 41(a) of the Act for failing to establish that they will leave Canada by the end of the period authorized for their stay.

    - IRCC officer generally writes a 44(1) report. But when it's about security, human rights issue, organized criminality, CBSA will manage the case.
    - The federal court in ***Hernandez v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)***, [2005 FC 429](https://canlii.ca/t/1k2fj){:target="\_blank"} concluded that the scope of discretion under ss 44(1) and (2) is broad to **allow consideration of H&C**.
    - **Onus of Proof:** at an admissibility hearing the onus of proof **depends on whether the person concerned (PC) has legal status in Canada.**
        - if the PC was denied the right to enter Canada, and therefore has no legal status, the onus is on the PC to prove they are not inadmissible
        - if the PC was allowed to enter Canada and is alleged at a later time to have become inadmissible, then the onus is on the hearings officer to prove those allegations.
    - **Standard of Proof:** In most cases the standard is "**reasonable grounds to believe**". For section 36(1) of the IRPA, where the permanent residents or foreign nationals are alleged to have "committed an act" outside Canada, the standard is "**on a balance of probabilities**".

??? note "Arrest and Detention"

    - **At the POE**, an officer may arrest and detain a PR or FN to ensure that the person will be available for examination (IRPA s 55(3)(a)), or the officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the person is inadmissible on any of the most serious grounds of inadmissibility. The officer must notify the ID so that **a detention review can be held within 48 hours** (IRPA s 57(1)).
    - **Wihtin Canada**, generally an office is required to issue **an immigration warrant** for arrest and detention. Within 48 hours of a detention, an officer may review the reasons for the detention and may exercise their authority under s 56(1) of IRPA to release the person. Otherwise, the officer must notify the ID so a review hearing could be held. (IRPA s 55(4)).
    - **A person appearing at an admissibility hearing** may be detained at the end of the hearing.
    - Unless a FN can prove they have the appropriate visa, a FN who is part of a group that is designated irregular arrival will be designated and known as a **DFN** under s 20.1(2) of the IRPA and subject to **automatic detention** if they are 16 years of age or older. (s 56(2))

??? note "The Immigration Division"

    - **Admissibility hearings.** The ID has the authority under s 45 of the IRPA to hear and decide whether PR and FN alleged to have contravened the IRPA should be allowed to **enter or remain in Canada or should be ordered removed**.
    - **Detention reviews.** The ID has the authority under s 54 of the IRPA to **review the reasons for the immigration detention** of PR, FN, and DFN to decide whether to release them or whether there are sufficient reasons to continue the detention.
    - Hearings before an ID member are quasi-judicial proceedings and are **adversarial**.
    - **Family members** who are included in the inadmissibility report may be **subject to the same removal order**.
    - the PC (person concerned) must be **personally in attendance** at the hearing.
    - Generally, the hearing officer (CBSA) first calls the PC. **There is no right against self-incrimination at an admissibility hearing**.
    - s 229(3) of the IRPR directs the ID to make a deportation order instead of the prescribed removal order against a person if the PC meets any of the following criteria:
        - previous subject to a removal order
        - failed to comply with any conditions or obligations imposed under IRPA or legislation
        - convicted in Canada
    - the ID member may make any of the following decisions (s 45 IRPA):
        - allow PC to enter Canada
        - grant status to PC
        - authorize PC to enter Canada for further examination
        - make removal order
    - Counsel may make a **oral request for written reasons** at the end of the hearing or later, **in writing**, provided that the request is made **within 10 days** of the date of the decision. (Rule 7(4))
    - The PC has **no right to appeal** to IAD if the inadmissibility is based on "**security, human rights violation, serious criminality or organized criminality.**" (s 64 IRPA)
    - DFN has no right of appeal to the RAD.
    - The detention review is initiated when the ID receives a **request** for a detention review from the **minister**. The issue of detention may also arise at the end of the inadmissibility hearing, after the member has issued a removal order, if the minister argues that there is a reason to place the PC in detention.
    - There is **no limit** to the amount of time that a person may be in **immigration detention** as long as there is a periodic review.
    - The Ontario Court of Appeal (***Wang v Canada***, [2018 ONCA 798](https://canlii.ca/t/hvd7t){:target="\_blank"} at 23, 33) has ruled that immigration detainees can apply for ***hebeas corpus*** to challenge their incarceration in situations that amount to "indefinite detention" under the Charter.
    - The time for ID to review the reasons for a continued detention (A 57(1) & (2)):
        - the initial review: 48 hours of detention
        - the second review: 7 days of first detention
        - subsequent review: 30 days following each of the previous review
    - A **DFN under 16 years** of age is excluded from the detention.
    - Detention reviews for **PR** who are being held under a **security certificate** are conducted by the **federal court**, not the ID (A82). **48 hours** for the initial review and **6 months** following the previous review.
    - Detention reviews before the ID are adversarial hearings.
    - Factors to be considered if a PC should be detained (R 244):
        - flight risk
        - danger to the public
        - identity not established, and
        - other factors (R248, 249)

???+ note "Removal"

    - **Canadian citizen are not subject to removal.** The only situation in which a citizen may be removed from Canada is if their citizenship is first **revoked**. This may happen if the citizenship was granted on the basis of a **misrepresentation**.
    - Family members of a foreign national who is the subject of a removal order may also be included within the order.
    - The type of removal order made against a PC depends on which ground of inadmissibility are found to have been violated. 
        - **departure orders (R224):** no authorization is necessary to return. 30 days to becomes enforceable. require a certificate of departure when leaving.

    - R229. An exclusion order must be issued by the ID when a person is found to be inadmissible to Canada. The person must apply for an authorization to return within barred period. [How to apply?](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/inadmissibility/reasons/authorization-return-canada/apply.html){:target="\_blank"} and [ARC op1: procedure](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/resources/manuals/op/op01-eng.pdf){:target="\_blank"}
    - **Five ways** a removal may be **stayed**:
        - by the minister
        - by application for leave for a judicial review
        - by application for PRRA
        - by approval on H&C grounds
