??? note "How to Respond to a PFL Alleging Medical Inadmissibility"

    - Threshold of excessive demand on Canada’s health and social services: **$135,810 over 5 years** (or $27,162 per year) for 2025. See "[Medical inadmissibility](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/inadmissibility/reasons/medical-inadmissibility.html){:target="\_blank"}"
    - Six steps for responding to allegations of medical inadmissibility under the IRPA s. 38
        1. Determine the relevant section of the IRPA:
              1. IRPA s 38(a): danger to public **health** (e.g., active, contagious disease)
              2. IRPA s 38(b): danger to public **safety**  (e.g., illness tied to unpredictable behaviour)
              3. IRPA s 38(c): excessive **demand** on health care or social services  (i.e., costs in excess of $102,585 over 5 years or $20,517 per year)
        2. Critically evaluate the level of detail in the PFL
              1. Did you get enough detail to understand the allegations?
              2. Are the allegedly “excessive medical costs” applicable? **Possible exemptions include physiotherapy and special education**, which are considered investments, not costs.
        3. **Ask for more detail** and/or make an **access to information** request
              1. it's often advisable to do both (i.e., ask more more detail and submit an Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP)).
              2. Even if the PFL has sufficient detail, an ATIP request does not hurt.
        4. Verify the accuracy of the information in the PFL and gather **counter evidence**
              1. Counter generic claims in the letter with the specific circumstances of your client. Do doctors disagree about what constitutes a “necessary” medical procedure? Weigh generic costs against specific costs for your client.
              2. Evidence: affidavits, letters from doctors, medical evidence, etc. 
        5. Make submissions on the **H & C considerations**
              1. H and C considerations include:
                   - The **interests of children** that are impacted by decision
                   - Any **hardship** that would result from a refusal
              2. It does not hurt to argue H & C concurrently, so that if there is a medical inadmissibility, you have another option.
        6. Explore other forms of recourse
              1. Immigration Appeal Divison
              2. Appeal at Federal Court
