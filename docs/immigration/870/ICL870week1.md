??? note "How to Respond to a PFL Alleging Medical Inadmissibility"

    - Threshold of excessive demand on Canada’s health and social services: **$135,810 over 5 years** (or $27,162 per year) for 2025. See "[Medical inadmissibility](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/inadmissibility/reasons/medical-inadmissibility.html){:target="\_blank"}"
    - Six steps for responding to allegations of medical inadmissibility under the IRPA s. 38
        1. Determine the relevant section of the IRPA:
              1. IRPA s 38(a): danger to public **health** (e.g., active, contagious disease)
              2. IRPA s 38(b): danger to public **safety**  (e.g., illness tied to unpredictable behaviour)
              3. IRPA s 38(c): excessive **demand** on health care or social services  (i.e., costs in excess of $102,585 over 5 years or $20,517 per year)
        2. Critically evaluate the level of detail in the PFL
              1. Did you get enough detail to understand the allegations?
              2. Are the allegedly “excessive medical costs” applicable? **Possible exemptions include physiotherapy and special education**, which are considered investments, not costs.
        3. **Ask for more detail** and/or make an **access to information** request
              1. it's often advisable to do both (i.e., ask more more detail and submit an Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP)).
              2. Even if the PFL has sufficient detail, an ATIP request does not hurt.
        4. Verify the accuracy of the information in the PFL and gather **counter evidence**
              1. Counter generic claims in the letter with the specific circumstances of your client. Do doctors disagree about what constitutes a “necessary” medical procedure? Weigh generic costs against specific costs for your client.
              2. Evidence: affidavits, letters from doctors, medical evidence, etc. 
        5. Make submissions on the **H & C considerations**
              1. H and C considerations include:
                   - The **interests of children** that are impacted by decision
                   - Any **hardship** that would result from a refusal
              2. It does not hurt to argue H & C concurrently, so that if there is a medical inadmissibility, you have another option.
        6. Explore other forms of recourse
              1. Immigration Appeal Divison
              2. Appeal at Federal Court

??? note "Procedural Fairness Letters"

    - One aspect of procedural fairness is that an applicant must be made aware of the case they have to meet: see ***Akhtar v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***, [2019 FC 123](http://canlii.ca/t/hxn8z){:target="\_blank"} at para 19; ***Canadian Pacific Railway Company v Canada (Attorney General)***, [2018 FCA 69](http://canlii.ca/t/hrgf2){:target="\_blank"} at para 56. This is also reflected in IRCC’s [operational instructions on procedural fairness](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/procedural-fairness.html){:target="\_blank"}.
    - To ensure that the applicant has a meaningful opportunity to participate, decision-makers must give **sufficient notice** about any process or interview that could result in a decision on their application and must give the applicant a reasonable **opportunity to bring evidence or make arguments** supporting their application. Decision-makers should tell applicants **which documents may be required in order to address concerns**. Sufficient information should be included on interview invitation letters to allow applicants to prepare. If any additional concerns arise from an interview, decision-makers should provide the applicant with **an opportunity to address those concerns** either at the interview or subsequent to the interview, through a procedural fairness letter.
    - The right to be heard requires that an applicant be given a meaningful opportunity to take part in the process. This requirement also applies in regard to information received from third parties, including IRCC partners. While this does **not mean that the decision-maker must provide the physical documents** consulted during the decision-making process (***El Maghraoui v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***, [2013 FC 883](http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/fc-cf/decisions/en/item/62526/index.do?r=AAAAAQAJYXVndXN0IDIwAQ){:target="\_blank"}), there is a requirement that the essence of the decision-maker’s **concerns be communicated to the applicant** (***Krishnamoorthy v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***, [2011 FC 1342](http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/fc-cf/decisions/en/item/60187/index.do?r=AAAAAQAOa3Jpc2huYW1vb3J0aHkB){:target="\_blank"}) and that the applicant is advised of the specific provisions of the Act at issue. What is important is that the decision-maker’s concerns are adequately communicated to the applicant, who must then be given a reasonable opportunity to respond.
    - The purpose of procedural fairness letters is described in ***Bui v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***, [2019 FC 440](http://canlii.ca/t/hzrhg){:target="\_blank"}:
        - [29] An officer may put concerns to an applicant by way of a procedural fairness letter. Said letter must contain enough detail to enable the applicant to know the case to meet, meaning that the **applicant is provided with a reasonable understanding of why the officer is inclined to deny the application** (***Bayramov v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***, [2019 FC 256](https://canlii.ca/t/hxvtz){:target="\_blank"} at para 15; ***Ezemenari v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***, [2012 FC 619](https://canlii.ca/t/frt67){:target="\_blank"} at para 11). In other words, an applicant should not be “kept in the dark” about the information upon which an officer may render a decision (***Chawla v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***, [2014 FC 434](https://canlii.ca/t/g6sdg){:target="\_blank"} at para 19).

??? note "Chapter 2 of Sharma & Daghighian"

    1. Janet is an immigration consultant at an established firm. She has been contacted by Goriki, a client who frantically informed Janet that he has been found inadmissible for trafficking heroin. Goriki insists that he was merely a drug mule forced to participate in the trafficking. Goriki tells Janet that he must stay in Canada to be with his young children. Which of the following is **NOT** true about the potential remedies Janet can seek for Goriki? 
        - [x] Goriki can apply for a humanitarian and compassionate exemption from his criminal inadmissibility, which would stay the enforcement proceedings against him 
        - [ ] Goriki can apply for a humanitarian and compassionate exemption from his criminal inadmissibility, which would consider the best interests of his children as part of the assessment 
        - [ ] Prior to removal, Goriki can apply for pre-removal risk assessment if his removal would subject him to a personalized risk to life or of cruel and unusual punishment  
        - [ ] Goriki can apply for a temporary resident permit, which is a highly discretionary tool for individuals found criminally inadmissible but has compelling reasons to stay in Canada 
    > The H & C application, on its own, does not stay, stop or suspend enforcement proceedings in Canada.

    2. Dobu is an experienced immigration consultant. One of Dobu's clients, Yano, has been charged with an indictable offense. Which of the following is **not a possible consequence** for Yano? 
        - [ ] If Yano is sponsoring his eight-year-old daughter, he may become an ineligible sponsor 
        - [ ] If Yano is a protected person, he is at risk of being back to his country of nationality 
        - [x] If Yano is a permanent resident, he would be safeguarded against removal from Canada, but he will serve his sentence at a federal penitentiary 
        - [ ] If Yano is being sponsored by his wife, his application will be jeopardized

    3. Raze went on a trip to Columbia and was charged with public disturbance during her trip (equivalent to a summary conviction in Canada). Which of the following is **incorrect** regarding her return to Canada? 
        - [ ] At the Point of Entry, Raze will be given an opportunity to respond to the CBSA officer's concerns about her criminal charge
        - [x] The CBSA officer must be satisfied on a balance of probabilities that Raze committed the offense charged in order to issue a negative decision 
        - [ ] If Raze is a Permanent Resident, she will be allowed entry into Canada, and an enforcement proceeding will be initiated via a Section 44 Report 
        - [ ] If Raze is a Foreign National, she may not be allowed entry by the CBSA officer 
    > The standard of proof for **inadmissibility** is set out in s 33 of the IRPA, which is the "**reasonable grounds**" threshold. This standard is lower than the civil standard of balance of probabilities. 

    4. If Mr. Chowdhury is found inadmissible on security grounds, each of the following is a possible outcome **except**: 
        - [ ] Mr. Chowdhury will be **unable to advance a refugee claim**

        - [ ] If the deaths and injuries from the political protests were unforeseeable and a by-product, it would not be sufficient 
        - [ ] It must be shown that the political party intended the death or serious injury to be caused to civilians during the protests 
        - [x] If an organization is not on the list of terrorist organizations, the decision-maker can conclude that it would not fall within the scope of s 34(1)(c) 
        - [ ] Wilful blindness to the potential violence that could result from protests is not sufficient to find intention to cause deaths or serious injuries
