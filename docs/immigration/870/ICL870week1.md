??? note "How to Respond to a PFL Alleging Medical Inadmissibility"

    - Threshold of excessive demand on Canada’s health and social services: **$135,810 over 5 years** (or $27,162 per year) for 2025. See "[Medical inadmissibility](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/inadmissibility/reasons/medical-inadmissibility.html){:target="\_blank"}"
    - Six steps for responding to allegations of medical inadmissibility under the IRPA s. 38
        1. Determine the relevant section of the IRPA:
              1. IRPA s 38(a): danger to public **health** (e.g., active, contagious disease)
              2. IRPA s 38(b): danger to public **safety**  (e.g., illness tied to unpredictable behaviour)
              3. IRPA s 38(c): excessive **demand** on health care or social services  (i.e., costs in excess of $102,585 over 5 years or $20,517 per year)
        2. Critically evaluate the level of detail in the PFL
              1. Did you get enough detail to understand the allegations?
              2. Are the allegedly “excessive medical costs” applicable? **Possible exemptions include physiotherapy and special education**, which are considered investments, not costs.
        3. **Ask for more detail** and/or make an **access to information** request
              1. it's often advisable to do both (i.e., ask more more detail and submit an Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP)).
              2. Even if the PFL has sufficient detail, an ATIP request does not hurt.
        4. Verify the accuracy of the information in the PFL and gather **counter evidence**
              1. Counter generic claims in the letter with the specific circumstances of your client. Do doctors disagree about what constitutes a “necessary” medical procedure? Weigh generic costs against specific costs for your client.
              2. Evidence: affidavits, letters from doctors, medical evidence, etc. 
        5. Make submissions on the **H & C considerations**
              1. H and C considerations include:
                   - The **interests of children** that are impacted by decision
                   - Any **hardship** that would result from a refusal
              2. It does not hurt to argue H & C concurrently, so that if there is a medical inadmissibility, you have another option.
        6. Explore other forms of recourse
              1. Immigration Appeal Divison
              2. Appeal at Federal Court

???+ note "Procedural Fairness Letters"

    - One aspect of procedural fairness is that an applicant must be made aware of the case they have to meet: see ***Akhtar v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***, [2019 FC 123](http://canlii.ca/t/hxn8z){:target="\_blank"} at para 19; ***Canadian Pacific Railway Company v Canada (Attorney General)***, [2018 FCA 69](http://canlii.ca/t/hrgf2){:target="\_blank"} at para 56. This is also reflected in IRCC’s [operational instructions on procedural fairness](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/procedural-fairness.html){:target="\_blank"}.
    - To ensure that the applicant has a meaningful opportunity to participate, decision-makers must give **sufficient notice** about any process or interview that could result in a decision on their application and must give the applicant a reasonable **opportunity to bring evidence or make arguments** supporting their application. Decision-makers should tell applicants **which documents may be required in order to address concerns**. Sufficient information should be included on interview invitation letters to allow applicants to prepare. If any additional concerns arise from an interview, decision-makers should provide the applicant with **an opportunity to address those concerns** either at the interview or subsequent to the interview, through a procedural fairness letter.
    - The right to be heard requires that an applicant be given a meaningful opportunity to take part in the process. This requirement also applies in regard to information received from third parties, including IRCC partners. While this does **not mean that the decision-maker must provide the physical documents** consulted during the decision-making process (***El Maghraoui v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***, [2013 FC 883](http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/fc-cf/decisions/en/item/62526/index.do?r=AAAAAQAJYXVndXN0IDIwAQ){:target="\_blank"}), there is a requirement that the essence of the decision-maker’s **concerns be communicated to the applicant** (***Krishnamoorthy v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***, [2011 FC 1342](http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/fc-cf/decisions/en/item/60187/index.do?r=AAAAAQAOa3Jpc2huYW1vb3J0aHkB){:target="\_blank"}) and that the applicant is advised of the specific provisions of the Act at issue. What is important is that the decision-maker’s concerns are adequately communicated to the applicant, who must then be given a reasonable opportunity to respond.
    - The purpose of procedural fairness letters is described in ***Bui v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***, [2019 FC 440](http://canlii.ca/t/hzrhg){:target="\_blank"}:
        - [29] An officer may put concerns to an applicant by way of a procedural fairness letter. Said letter must contain enough detail to enable the applicant to know the case to meet, meaning that the **applicant is provided with a reasonable understanding of why the officer is inclined to deny the application** (***Bayramov v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***, [2019 FC 256](https://canlii.ca/t/hxvtz){:target="\_blank"} at para 15; ***Ezemenari v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***, [2012 FC 619](https://canlii.ca/t/frt67){:target="\_blank"} at para 11). In other words, an applicant should not be “kept in the dark” about the information upon which an officer may render a decision (***Chawla v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***, [2014 FC 434](https://canlii.ca/t/g6sdg){:target="\_blank"} at para 19).
