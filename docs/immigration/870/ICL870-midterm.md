# Midterm Practice Quiz

1. What is the limitation period for the Minister to bring an inadmissibility proceeding?  
    - [ ] Two years under the statutory limitation period per s 4 of Limitations Act 
    - [ ] 10 years under the immigration limitation period per s 1 of the IRPA 
    - [ ] 15 years under the ultimate limitation period per s 15 of Limitations Act
    - [x] There is no statute of limitations    
    > There is no statute of limitations with respect to immigration proceedings – the Minister's inadmissibility application can be based on events that occurred at anytime in the past (Raj Sharma & Aris Daghighian, Chapter 3, p. 279).

2. You receive a call from Wei, who is in Canada as a Temporary Resident. Wei was recently charged in Canada with Break and Enter as he broke into a convenience store after it was closed to try and steal various food items. Breaking and entering into a place that is not a dwelling house is a hybrid offence in Canada. Wei has said that he wants to plead guilty, and his criminal lawyer said that the crown would proceed summarily and be willing to suggest a suspended sentence and probation order, since this was his first offence. Which of the following is true for Wei’s case?
    - [x] Depending on the potential sentence for the offence in the Criminal Code, Wei could still be inadmissible for either serious criminality or criminality. 
    - [ ] Wei's actual sentence is irrelevant to the admissibility determination. 
    - [ ] If the Crown proceeds summarily, Wei can be found inadmissible for criminality but not serious criminality. 
    - [ ] If the Crown proceeds summarily and Wei receives less than a six-month sentence, Wei cannot be found inadmissible.  
    > **The IRPA treats hybrid offences under the Criminal Code as indictable offences**, even if the Crown proceeds summarily. Suspended sentences and probation orders are still convictions, so depending on the sentence, this offence could render Wei inadmissible (Raj Sharma & Aris Daghighian, Chapter 2, pp. 17, 19).

3. Maria is a permanent resident of Canada. After returning from a trip to the U.S., she was stopped at the border and her vehicle was searched. The border officers found three small bags of cocaine underneath a compartment in her trunk. She was subsequently charged by Canadian authorities with possession pursuant to s. 4(1) of the Controlled Drugs and Substances Act. This is an indictable offence that is punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of less than 10 years. She was sentenced to 8 months imprisonment. Maria has a hearing before the Immigration Division, she explains that she was a drug addict but has since gotten sober and that she has two Canadian children for whom she is the sole provider.

    Which of the following outcomes is in line with the IRPA and IRPR?

    - [ ] Maria is not criminally inadmissible because she is a permanent resident, and the criminal act is not punishable by at least 10 years imprisonment. 
    - [ ] Maria is not criminally inadmissible because she obtained the cocaine from outside Canada and there was no conviction in the United States. 
    - [x] Maria is criminally inadmissible because she was sentenced to a term of imprisonment of more than six months. 
    - [ ] Maria is criminally inadmissible but there are sufficient humanitarian factors to overcome her inadmissibility.  
    
    > Maria is criminally inadmissible under s. 36(1)(a) of the IRPA. Under s. 36(1)(a), a permanent resident is inadmissible for serious criminality where they have been convicted in Canada of an offence under an Act of Parliament (here, the CDSA), **where the offence is punishable by a term of imprisonment of at least 10 years** (this does not apply here) **or where a term of imprisonment of more than six months has been imposed** (this does apply here, because she was sentenced to 8 months' imprisonment). (Raj Sharma & Aris Daghighian, Chapter 2, p 19; IRPA, s. 36(1)(a)).

4. Genevieve is applying for permanent residence in Canada. She received a procedural fairness letter from an immigration officer expressing concerns that her husband may be medically inadmissible on the grounds of excessive demand on health or social services. The officer is alleging that his lung cancer makes him medically inadmissible to Canada. She brings it to your office, which options might assist in overcoming the potential inadmissibility?
    - [ ] Providing a statutory declaration and supporting documentation demonstrating that, if chemotherapy is required, Genevieve has the ability to pay for the costs of the required medications.
    - [ ] Providing evidence to demonstrate that her husband's condition is no longer active and doesn't require ongoing treatment. 
    - [ ] Requesting an H&C exemption from his inadmissibility based on compelling circumstances and the best interests of their children. 
    - [x] All of the above

5. Based on your understanding of the ID rules and the grounds of inadmissibility, what ground of inadmissibility is the s. 44 report based on?
    - [ ] s 36 (1)(c), that is, "…inadmissible on grounds of serious criminality for committing an act outside Canada that is an offence in the place where it was committed and that, if committed in Canada, would constitute an offence under an Act of Parliament punishable by a maximum term of imprisonment of at least 10 years." 
    - [ ] s 42(1)(a), that is, " … inadmissible on grounds of an inadmissible family member if their accompanying family member or, in prescribed circumstances, their non-accompanying family member is inadmissible." 
    - [x] s 40(1)(a) , that is, "… inadmissible for misrepresentation for directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding material facts relating to a relevant matter that induces or could induce an error in the administration of this Act" 
    - [ ] s 36(2)(c), that is, "…inadmissible on grounds of criminality for committing an act outside Canada that is an offence in the place where it was committed and that, if committed in Canada, would constitute an indictable offence under an Act of Parliament." 
    > The family would appear to be inadmissible on two grounds: **failure to meet the residence requirement** (see Raj Sharma & Aris Daghighian, Chapter 1.V., pp. 94-108) and **misrepresentation** (Raj Sharma & Aris Daghighian, Chapter 1.II., pp. 53-80). However, **a finding that the family had failed to meet the residence requirement would lead to a removal order issued by an officer** (IRPR, s. 228(2)), and not a referral to the ID. Moreover, as the entire family made the application, the inadmissibility pertains to the entire family (save the Canadian-citizen child), and not only one of them.

6. What is your most effective and immediate **first step**?  
    - [ ] Draft and send written submissions for H&C consideration and request that Mr. Ming's referral for an admissibility hearing be withdrawn. 
    - [ ] Gather and provide financial information to the ID to show that Mr. Ming is the principal source of income for his family and show why it would not be in the best interests of his two minor children for him to be found inadmissible.
    - [x] Send a Use of Representative form to CBSA and a Counsel Contact Information form to the ID. 
    - [ ] Gather information to prepare a refugee claim for Mr. Ming.  

7. Which of the following options would be the most effective next step?  
    - [ ] Make an application for an extension of time to the ID
    - [x] Make an application for a change of the hearing date
    - [ ] Make an application for a change of venue 
    - [ ] Make an application for a designated representative for Mr. Ming  

8. Your client, Fatima is a permanent resident.  She has been referred to an admissibility hearing on the basis that she made **misrepresentations** in her permanent residence application. She has two Canadian born children. Which of the following statements is **false**?   
    - [ ] If the ID finds Fatima to be inadmissible, it has to issue a removal order against her. 
    - [ ] **Fatima can appeal the ID's decision to the IAD.**
    - [x] The ID will consider if relevant humanitarian and compassionate factors outweigh Fatima's admissibility.
    - [ ] Fatima can call witnesses to support her case.   
    > The ID has no humanitarian and compassionate discretion (see Raj Sharma & Aris Daghighian, Chapter 3.III at p. 265).

9. Julian is a permanent resident who, after receiving a removal order, is seeking to have it appealed at the IAD. Julian is concerned about the ID’s decision and believes that he has very compelling humanitarian grounds in his case.  Which of the following is true about the IAD’s jurisdiction?   
    - [ ] The IAD can only depart from the determination made by the ID if they provide reasonable grounds for doing so. 
    - [ ] The IAD may only consider humanitarian and compassionate grounds if the ID did.
    - [x] **The IAD is not bound by the previous determination and must consider the case anew.** 
    - [ ] The IAD cannot consider evidence that was not before the ID.   

10. Your client, Elijah is attending a hearing before the IAD, appealing a removal order issued against him on the grounds of criminality. Elijah asks you what will happen if the IAD orders that his removal order is stayed. Which of the following statements is correct?   
    - [x] If Elijah's removal order is stayed, it will be suspended for a period of time and the IAD will likely impose conditions on Elijah. 
    - [ ] If Elijah's removal order is stayed, his PR status will be restored. 
    - [ ] If Elijah's removal order is stayed, it will remain that way until the ID makes a decision on redetermination. 
    - [ ] If Elijah's removal order is stayed, he will no longer be inadmissible to Canada unless he commits another offence. 
    > Where removal is stayed or suspended, IAD can impose conditions that it considers necessary. All conditions imposed by the Immigration Division are cancelled. The IAD has the power to cancel the stay where warranted. S68(2) IRPA

11. Reyna, a PR was convicted of an indictable offence and sentenced to four months in prison. Would she be eligible for an **appeal** before the IAD?   
    - [x] Yes, because Reyna's sentence was less than 6 months 
    - [ ] Not if Reyna is also sentenced to probation after the 6 months
    - [ ] No, because Reyna would be inadmissible on serious criminality grounds 
    - [ ] Maybe, it depends on the seriousness of the offence committed by Reyna 
    > There is no right of appeal to IAD for offences punishable in Canada by a term of imprisonment of at least six months. See s64(2) IRPA.

12. An appeal to the IAD is available for:   
    - [x] Katie who was found inadmissible on medical grounds 
    - [ ] Serie who was found inadmissible on security grounds 
    - [ ] Jina who was found inadmissible for human rights violation
    - [ ] Yuri who was found inadmissible for organized criminality   
    > Per s64(1), **no appeal** may be made to the Immigration Appeal Division by a foreign national or their sponsor or by a permanent resident if the foreign national or permanent resident has been found to be inadmissible on grounds of **security**, **violating human or international rights**, **sanctions**, **serious criminality or organized criminality**.

13. Tabitha was convicted of possession of a Schedule II drug. She was sentenced to two years in prison and one year of probation. When can Tabitha apply for rehabilitation? 
    - [ ] After Tabitha has completed her prison time
    - [ ] Five years after Tabitha has completed her prison time
    - [ ] After Tabitha has completed her probation 
    - [x] Five years after Tabitha has completed her probation   
    > Pursuant to s. 36 (3)(c) of IRPA, a matter referred to in paragraph 36(2)(b) will not be considered an inadmissibility if, after the prescribed period, the Minister is satisfied that they have been rehabilitated. The prescribed period is defined in s. 17 (a) of the IRPR as being 5 years after the completion of the imposed sentence. The imposed sentence was 2 years in prison and 1 year probation. As such, her sentence ends after the 1 year probation. The answer is "five years after she completed probation." 

14. Jeremy was convicted of drunk driving on July 1, 2021. He had his driver’s license suspended for two years, with no imprisonment imposed. When can Jeremy apply for rehabilitation?  
    - [ ] Right away because Jamie does not need to serve prison time
    - [ ] July 1, 2023 
    - [ ] July 1, 2026 
    - [x] July 1, 2028    
    > Jeremy was convicted of an indictable offence of DUI. This is serious criminality so would fall under s. 36 (1)(b) of IRPA. His sentence was the suspension of his licence for 2 years. He is eligible to apply for rehabilitation 5 years from the completion of his sentence. His sentence, the licence suspension, ends after July 1, 2023. He can apply for rehabilitation 5 years later, or on July 1, 2028. 

15. When conducting the **equivalence analysis to a Canadian offense**, what standard of proof must the officer be satisfied that Yuri committed the offense?   
    - [ ] Balance of probabilities 
    - [ ] Beyond a reasonable doubt
    - [x] **Reasonable grounds to believe** 
    - [ ] Mere suspicion   
    > Yuri was convicted of a serious criminal offence in a foreign jurisdiction. This would fall within s. 36(1)(b) of IRPA. In conducting the equivalency analysis, the immigration officer will apply s. 33 of IRPA to his assessment. Section 33 states that the standard of proof for inadmissibility under s. 34 to s. 37, is reasonable grounds to believe.

16. If a Section 44 Report has been referred to the Immigration Division for an admissibility hearing, what kind of removal order can the ID issue if the threshold for serious criminality is met?   
    - [ ] Departure Order
    - [x] Deportation Order
    - [ ] Extradition Order
    - [ ] Exclusion Order

17. Yuri’s counsel is preparing for the admissibility hearing. Yuri’s counsel believes there may be some relevant documents in possession of the Minister’s counsel that may be helpful for his case. What documents must the Minister’s counsel provide under their disclosure obligations?
    - [ ] The Minister's counsel is not required to provide any documents in their possession 
    - [ ] The Minister's counsel is required to provide any evidence that is not exculpatory or beneficial for Yuri
    - [ ] The Minister's counsel is required to provide any evidence they wish to rely upon in the admissibility hearing
    - [x] The Minister's counsel must provide any evidence in their possession that may be relevant to the inquiry  
    > In the case of *Brown v Canada*, 2020 FCA 130, the Federal Court of Appeal, held that the Minister is required to provide not just any evidence or information it intends to rely on, but also any evidence and information in its possession that may be relevant to the inquiry, including what may be exculpatory or beneficial to the person concerned. 

18. If a removal order is issued for Yuri, how can he challenge such an order?
    - [ ] Appeal to the IAD 
    - [ ] Appeal to the Minister
    - [x] Judicial review
    - [ ] Appeal to the Ontario Divisional Court 
    > Yuri's inadmissibility falls under the purview of s. 36(1)(b) of the IRPA. As per s. 64(2) of the IRPA he has no right of appeal to the IAD. He may, however, seek leave for judicial review of the admissibility finding to the Federal Court. The Federal Court is the last stop before the execution of the removal order.

19. If Yuri submits a humanitarian & compassionate application, which of the following is **incorrect** about such an application?
    - [x] Yuri is required to carry out his sentence in Canada before applying for H&C
    - [ ] Yuri may be able to receive a permanent residence status from a successful H&C application
    - [ ] The H&C application will allow Yuri to remain in Canada if successful
    - [ ] The H&C application can allow for a stay of removal
    > **An H&C application can be used to overcome criminal inadmissibility to Canada**, but there is no requirement to carry out a sentence before applying for H&C. Overall, H&C applications allow foreign nationals who are inadmissible or ineligible to apply for permanent residence based on humanitarian and compassionate considerations and if successful allows the foreign national to stay in Canada. Although on its own, an H&C application does not stay a removal proceeding, it may assist in obtaining a stay of removal from the Federal Court.

20. If Yuri applies for a **TRP**, in order for the application to succeed, what must Yuri show?
    - [ ] It is in the best interests of Yuri's children for Yuri to stay in Canada  
    - [ ] The benefit of having Yuri stay in Canada outweigh the risks
    - [x] There are compelling reasons for Yuri to be in Canada and these reasons outweigh the risks to the health and safety of Canadians
    - [ ] Yuri has been rehabilitated and will not commit any more crimes
    > The issuance of a TRP is authorized by **s. 24(1) of the IRPA**. **TRPs are a catchall when permanent admission is not viable.** Such application involves a balancing between the health or risk to the Canadian public versus the need or reason for entry to Canada. **There is a great deal of deference and discretion to immigration officers who assess these applications.**
