# Module 7: Conducting a DR

## Notes

??? note "Tutorial notes"

    - Wednesday 4:00pm.

??? note "Introduction"

    - Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, "Preparing for Detention Reviews  > Detention Reviews," [online](https://irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/detention-hearings/Pages/detention-review-hearings.aspx){:target="\_blank"}.

    - **Possible reasons for being detained.** The CBSA representative can ask the Immigration Division member to keep a person detained if the CBSA believes:
        - **The person is a danger to the public.** To support its position, the CBSA may give examples of:
            - association with a criminal organization
            - criminal convictions or pending charges for sexual offences, certain drug-related offences, or offences involving violence or weapons
            - any behaviour, activities and events that support the claim that the person should be considered dangerous
        > Detainees can provide their own evidence and arguments to show the member why they are not a danger.
        - **The person will probably not appear for an immigration hearing or for removal from Canada.** To support its position, the CBSA may give examples of times when the person:
            - did not appear for immigration or court matters
            - did not follow conditions
            - entered a country illegally
            - escaped from custody
        > A detained person can provide their own evidence and arguments to show the member that they will appear when asked to do so.
        - **The person's identity has not been established but can be.** The detained person may have come to Canada without identity documents or with identity documents that might not be genuine. The CBSA may not be able to confirm the detained person's identity right away.
            - A person must help the CBSA establish their identity. They can do this by trying to get their identity documents and by giving information that will help the CBSA establish their identity.
            - The Immigration Division member will consider the CBSA's efforts, and the detained person's cooperation with the CBSA in proving their identity, before deciding to continue their detention or to order their release.
        - **The person might be inadmissible to Canada for security reasons or because of a violation of human or international rights, serious criminality, criminality, or organized criminality**.
            - The CBSA will explain what steps they are taking to find out whether the person is inadmissible for one of these reasons. In this situation, the Immigration Division member can only consider whether the CBSA has a **reasonable suspicion** and is taking the **necessary steps** to investigate it.
        - **Other factors that will be considered in a detention review.** The member must consider the reasons a person is in detention, and also:
            - how long they have been in detention
            - how long detention might continue if they are not released
            - whether they or the CBSA have caused any unexplained delay
            - any alternative to detention that is available
            - the best interests of any directly affected child
        > Detainees may present evidence and arguments about any of these factors for the member to consider.
    - **There may be an alternative to detention.** An alternative to detention is a release plan that may include conditions the detained person must obey. The detained person can suggest an alternative to detention. When preparing for their hearing, detained persons should think about reasonable alternatives to detention. Conditions could include:
        - providing the CBSA with their residential address
        - reporting regularly to the CBSA
        - obeying a curfew
        - living with a specific person
        - avoiding drinking alcohol or taking drugs
        - any other conditions that are needed in the case
    > The member will decide if conditions are necessary and what they should be.
    - **The alternative to detention may also include a bond.** There are 2 types of bonds:
        - **Deposit** (also called a cash bond): Money is deposited with the government before the detained person is released. If the detained person does not obey the conditions, the Government of Canada will keep the money and CBSA may arrest and detain the person again. If the detained person obeys the conditions, CBSA will eventually return the money to the bondsperson.
        - **Guarantee** (also called a performance bond): The bondsperson promises to pay an amount of money if the detained person does not obey release conditions. If the detained person does not obey the conditions, the Government of Canada will collect the money from the bondsperson and the CBSA may arrest and detain the person again. For a guarantee, the bondsperson must be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident of Canada and must show that they can afford to pay the bond and can ensure the detained person will obey the release conditions.
    > The person who provides the bond is known as a bondsperson. At the hearing, the CBSA representative and the member may ask the proposed bondsperson for information that will help the member decide if the bond is suitable. The bondsperson can provide this information before the hearing by completing a **Bondsperson Information form**.
    - **A person can ask the Immigration Division to change or cancel their conditions.**
        - If the detained person's situation changes after conditions are imposed, they can write a letter to the Immigration Division explaining why they think their conditions should be changed and send a copy of the letter to the CBSA. They can use the **Application to vary conditions** of release form to help write this letter.

??? note "Step-by-Step Overview"

    1. Pre-hearing discussions with CBSA hearings officer
        - **Informal, off-the-record discussion** with CBSA hearings officer (henceforth referred to as Minister’s counsel), usually in the absence of your client
        - Learn what the **Minister’s position** will be on the need for continued detention and the possibility of alternatives
        - Determine whether the Minister’s counsel intends to rely on **documents** or information that had not yet been disclosed
        - If possible, agree to and formulate **a joint submission on a release plan**
    2. Start of hearing: introduction by Board member and entry of exhibits
        - The Member will describe the nature and purpose of the hearing to the detainee. Documents that the parties wish to enter as exhibits (subject to objections) will be entered as exhibits.
    3. Minister's counsel provides information/updates to the Member and/or lead evidence in support of the detention
        - Minister’s counsel states the facts that they deem relevant to their position.
        - Minister’s counsel states their position re: the justification for ongoing detention or release.
        - Minister’s counsel may be called upon by either the Member or the detainee/counsel to provide evidence in support of the facts alleged.
    4. Detainee's counsel present the case in favor of release
        - Detainee/counsel call evidence and make submissions in favour of release
        - Detainee/counsel respond to the Minister’s counsel’s allegations/evidence/submissions
        - Where full submissions are being made at this stage, the detainee’s proposed alternatives to detention are described and defended
    5. Minister's counsel's submission
        - Minister's counsel provides oral submissions.
        - In some cases, this will be the first statement of the argument in favour of the Minister's counsel's position (i.e. where their initial statement was limited to updates and a bare statement of their position).
        - In other cases, where they have made their full submissions at the outset, they will simply state their arguments in response to the detainee’s evidence and/or argument.
    6. Detainee's submission
        - Counsel presents their arguments in favour of release
        - Alternatives to detention are described and defended
    7. Member's decision

??? note "Responding to new allegation/evidence"

    - Argue the member should disregard the novel evidence or allegation entirely because it is unfair to have it considered, given the absence of advanced disclosure.
    - seek an adjournment in order to have time to respond to the new evidence.
    - decide the evidence is either actually helpful to your case, or not sufficiently prejudicial to warrant an adjournment and go on to plead your case on the basis of the record as created in the hearing.

??? note "Presenting Alternatives to Detention"

    - It’s up to you to describe exactly what alternative is being proposed (i.e., what the conditions would be) and how that would mitigate the risks that have been invoked to justify the detention to date.
    - It’s important to remember, and to remind the Member, that alternatives to detention will almost never eliminate the risks underlying the grounds for detention, the idea is rather that the risks are sufficiently mitigated that detention is no longer justified.

??? note "Oral Submissions for Alexei's Detention Review"

    - you can think of oral submissions as having **four phases or parts**: 
        - **A brief opening statement** identifying what you want for your client, and a brief roadmap of your submissions.
        - The principal elements of your argument (generally, the **conclusions** that you want the decision-maker to reach with respect to both the s. 58 grounds and s. 248 factors), and an **outline of the evidence** that supports your position.
        - References as appropriate to relevant **legal authority** (legislation and binding case law) as well as reference to the **Guidelines** as applicable.
        - The relevant **facts** of your client’s case (this may include a review of results at prior detention review hearings)
