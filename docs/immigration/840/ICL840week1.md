## Notes

??? note "Tutorial notes"

    - Saturday 9:00am.

??? note "Introduction"

    - Canada, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, “Processing federal skilled worker class applications received on or after January 1, 2015” (6 June 2017), [online](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/federal-skilled-workers/post.html){:target="\_blank"}.
    - Readings:
        - *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act*, SC 2001, c **27**, ss **12(2)**, **14**, **14.1**.
        - *Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations*, SOR/2002-227, ss **70**, **295**, **303**; also scan headings from sections 72.8 to 109.
        - Canada, Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, "Ministerial Instructions" (last modified 16 September 2024), [online](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/ministerial-instructions.html){:target="\_blank"}.
        - Canada, Employment and Social Development Canada, "About the NOC" (last modified 2 June 2023), [online](https://noc.esdc.gc.ca/Home/AboutTheNoc){:target="\_blank"}.
    - Subsection 2(2) of the IRPA:
        - *Unless otherwise indicated, references in this Act to “this Act” include <strong>regulations</strong> made under it and <strong>instructions</strong> given under subsection 14.1(1).*
    - In the case of some provincial immigration programs, there is neither legislation nor regulation. All the programs details are set out in policy documents or on websites. Therefore familiarity with the government websites – being able to find the information you need and interpret it – on the website has become a vital skill.
    - Section 95 of the Canadian Constitution Act, 1867:
        - *In each Province the Legislature may make Laws in relation to Agriculture in the Province, and to <strong>Immigration into the Province</strong>; and it is hereby declared that the Parliament of Canada may from Time to Time make Laws in relation to Agriculture in all or any of the Provinces, and to Immigration into all or any of the Provinces; and any Law of the Legislature of a Province relative to Agriculture or to Immigration shall have effect in and for the Province as long and as far <strong>only as it is not repugnant to</strong> any Act of the Parliament of Canada.*
    - **Governor in Council:** refers to the Prime Minister of Canada and the ministers that make up their cabinet. Statutes passed by Parliament generally confer regulation-making powers on the Governor in Council.
    - Section 14 of the IRPA allows the Governor in Council (GIC) to create regulations that carry out the mandate of creating programs based on ability to become economically established.
        - the Federal Skilled Worker Class;
        - the Federal Skilled Trades Class;
        - the Canadian Experience Class;
        - the Start-Up Business Class;
        - the Self-Employed Persons Class.
    - **Provincial programs** are also set out in the federal regulations:
        - the Provincial Nominee Class, and
        - the Quebec Skilled Worker Class.
    - Section 14.1 of the IRPA since 2014 has given the Minister of IRCC the power to establish new **temporary classes** for up to five years using what are known as ministerial instructions. Using these instructions, the Minister has established **seven different programs**.
        - The **Atlantic Immigration Program**, initially established as a pilot in 2017 by Ministerial Instruction 23, to attract foreign nationals to Canada’s Atlantic provinces – **New Brunswick**, **Nova Scotia**, **Prince Edward Island**, or **Newfoundland and Labrador**. After demonstrated success through the pilot, the program became a **permanent** immigration program in 2022.

??? note "Economic Class Application Overview"

    - 20(1)(a) of the IRPA, states that any foreign national who seeks to enter or remain in Canada as a permanent resident must establish that they hold a permanent resident visa or other document (in practice, a **Confirmation of Permanent Residence**) required by the regulations and have come to Canada to establish permanent residence. If they have been selected by a province, they must also establish that they still intend to reside in that province.
    - 21(2) of the IRPA states that a foreign national becomes a permanent resident if an officer is satisfied that the foreign national has applied for that status, has met the obligations set out in paragraph 20(1)(a) and subsection 20(2) and is not inadmissible.
    - In essence, then, to receive a permanent resident visa under an economic-class program, a foreign national must **apply** (including by paying the appropriate fee); meet the selection **criteria** for an economic class; and neither be inadmissible nor have an **inadmissible** family member.
    - Express Entry Process:
        - As a first step, an expression of interest (sometimes also referred to as a “profile”) must be created under the [Express Entry online system](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry.html){:target="\_blank"}. Typically, a foreign national’s authorized representative (you) will create the expression of interest on their behalf.
        - Based on the answers given when creating the profile, the Express Entry system will generate a score for your client using the [Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/criteria-comprehensive-ranking-system.html){:target="\_blank"}.
        - Based on the CRS score, your client may then receive an invitation to apply. If your client receives an invitation to apply, they will have to submit a complete application **within 60 days**.
        - If an immigration officer determines your client meets the selection criteria for the Federal Skilled Worker class, they (and their family, if applicable) will be issued a** permanent resident visa** and/or **a confirmation of permanent residence**.
        - It is only once they are admitted at a port of entry that they become a permanent resident, pursuant to sections **20(1)(a) and 21(1) of the IRPA**.

## Quizzes

??? note "Knowledge Check 1.1: Required Readings: Overview and Context"

    1. The largest share of newcomers who come to Canada arrive in the economic class. According to the annual report to Parliament, which of the following is a reason that it is important to admit so many newcomers?
        - [ ] To stimulate innovation in Canada's economy, given that so much future economic growth will depend on technological change.
        - [ ] To fulfill Canada's humanitarian obligations, given the rise in the numbers of refugees worldwide.
        - [ ] To develop Canada's multicultural character, given the country's long-standing commitment to the values of tolerance and non-discrimination.
        - [x] To address persistent labour shortages, given Canada's aging population.
        > The Report states: "Though the labour market remains tight, it is easing and economic immigration will continue to be a Government of Canada priority to help address the persistent labour shortages resulting from the aging population and lower fertility rates, including in critical sectors such as healthcare where immigrants account for 1 out of every 4 workers."

    2. True or False: The government has not taken any steps to address a gap in labour market integration for female immigrants.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        > In 2018, the government launched the Racialized Newcomer Women Pilot to support targeted services for racialized newcomer women. While the Pilot expired in 2023, funding for select, existing projects has been extended until March 2025 to align availability of services with the upcoming 2024 Call for Proposals for the Settlement Program.

    3. According to the OECD’s report on labour migration in Canada, which of the following is/are true about the Express Entry system?
        - [ ] The Express Entry system selects eligible candidates from a pool every 3 months.
        - [ ] To qualify as an eligible candidate in the pool, the minimum criteria for all three federal programs must be met.
        - [x] The Express Entry system is not based on the expression of interest system in Australia.
        - [x] The Express Entry system is built on an in-depth assessment of the factors that led to the successful establishment of immigrants to Canada in the past.
        > The Express Entry system for permanent labour migration selects among eligible candidates from a pool about every other week, inviting the highest ranked candidates to apply for permanent residency until reaching a pre-defined number of invitations. To enter the pool, candidates must meet various minimum criteria for one of three federal programmes managed by the system. If successful, they are ranked against one another based on a comprehensive ranking system. **A unique feature of the Canadian model**, in contrast to other Expression of Interest systems in New Zealand and Australia, is the degree of refinement in the ranking system. This allows consideration of positive interactions of skills, such as that between language proficiency and the ability to transfer foreign qualifications to the Canadian context. The system is built on an in-depth assessment of the drivers of outcomes of previous migrants.

    4. Which of the following permanent economic immigration programs are administered using the online Express Entry system?
        - [x] Canadian Experience Class
        - [x] Federal Skilled Worker Class

        - [ ] True
        - [x] False

    6. Which of the following are difficulties with the Canadian economic immigration programs, according to the OECD’s report on Canada’s labour migration programs?
        - [ ] Canada’s economic programs can be hard to change. That inflexibility limits the government’s ability to adapt in the face of changes to the labour market.
        - [x] Requirements for being placed in the Express Entry pool differ from the criteria used in the universal points’ allocation within, and thus selection from, the pool.
        - [x] It can be a challenge for new permanent residents to have their foreign credential recognized. Canada’s federal form of government makes it hard to address this challenge.
        - [ ] Canada’s economic immigration programs do not provide adequate ways of assessing applicants’ ability to speak one of Canada’s official languages. They place undue emphasis on reading and writing ability.
        - [ ] Canada’s economic immigration programs face undue competition from Australia and New Zealand, and therefore have trouble attracting immigrants who will succeed in finding jobs.
        - [x] Some provincial and territorial immigration programs are not very selective. To ensure consistency with Canada’s overall objectives, foreign nationals coming through Canada’s provincial and territorial programs should be processed using the Express Entry system.

    7. True or False: The Government of Canada has been committed to using GBA+ in the development of policies, programs, and legislation since 1995. GBA+ helps Canada understand the **skill gaps** between immigrants from different parts of the world.
