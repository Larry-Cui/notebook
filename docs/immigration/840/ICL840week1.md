???+ note "Knowledge Check 1.1: Required Readings: Overview and Context"

    1. The largest share of newcomers who come to Canada arrive in the economic class. According to the annual report to Parliament, which of the following is a reason that it is important to admit so many newcomers?
        - [ ] To stimulate innovation in Canada's economy, given that so much future economic growth will depend on technological change.
        - [ ] To fulfill Canada's humanitarian obligations, given the rise in the numbers of refugees worldwide.
        - [ ] To develop Canada's multicultural character, given the country's long-standing commitment to the values of tolerance and non-discrimination.
        - [x] To address persistent labour shortages, given Canada's aging population.
        > The Report states: "Though the labour market remains tight, it is easing and economic immigration will continue to be a Government of Canada priority to help address the persistent labour shortages resulting from the aging population and lower fertility rates, including in critical sectors such as healthcare where immigrants account for 1 out of every 4 workers."

    2. True or False: The government has not taken any steps to address a gap in labour market integration for female immigrants.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        > In 2018, the government launched the Racialized Newcomer Women Pilot to support targeted services for racialized newcomer women. While the Pilot expired in 2023, funding for select, existing projects has been extended until March 2025 to align availability of services with the upcoming 2024 Call for Proposals for the Settlement Program.

    3. According to the OECD’s report on labour migration in Canada, which of the following is/are true about the Express Entry system?
        - [ ] The Express Entry system selects eligible candidates from a pool every 3 months.
        - [ ] To qualify as an eligible candidate in the pool, the minimum criteria for all three federal programs must be met.
        - [x] The Express Entry system is not based on the expression of interest system in Australia.
        - [x] The Express Entry system is built on an in-depth assessment of the factors that led to the successful establishment of immigrants to Canada in the past.
        > The Express Entry system for permanent labour migration selects among eligible candidates from a pool about every other week, inviting the highest ranked candidates to apply for permanent residency until reaching a pre-defined number of invitations. To enter the pool, candidates must meet various minimum criteria for one of three federal programmes managed by the system. If successful, they are ranked against one another based on a comprehensive ranking system. **A unique feature of the Canadian model**, in contrast to other Expression of Interest systems in New Zealand and Australia, is the degree of refinement in the ranking system. This allows consideration of positive interactions of skills, such as that between language proficiency and the ability to transfer foreign qualifications to the Canadian context. The system is built on an in-depth assessment of the drivers of outcomes of previous migrants.

    4. Which of the following permanent economic immigration programs are administered using the online Express Entry system?
        - [x] Canadian Experience Class
        - [x] Federal Skilled Worker Class

    6. Which of the following are difficulties with the Canadian economic immigration programs, according to the OECD’s report on Canada’s labour migration programs?
        - [ ] Canada’s economic programs can be hard to change. That inflexibility limits the government’s ability to adapt in the face of changes to the labour market.
        - [x] Requirements for being placed in the Express Entry pool differ from the criteria used in the universal points’ allocation within, and thus selection from, the pool.
        - [x] It can be a challenge for new permanent residents to have their foreign credential recognized. Canada’s federal form of government makes it hard to address this challenge.
        - [ ] Canada’s economic immigration programs do not provide adequate ways of assessing applicants’ ability to speak one of Canada’s official languages. They place undue emphasis on reading and writing ability.
        - [ ] Canada’s economic immigration programs face undue competition from Australia and New Zealand, and therefore have trouble attracting immigrants who will succeed in finding jobs.
        - [x] Some provincial and territorial immigration programs are not very selective. To ensure consistency with Canada’s overall objectives, foreign nationals coming through Canada’s provincial and territorial programs should be processed using the Express Entry system.
