??? note "FSW: Minimum Requirements"

    - R75(1): For the purposes of subsection 12(2) of the Act, the federal skilled worker class is hereby prescribed as a class of persons who are skilled workers and who may become permanent residents on the basis of their ability to become **economically established** in Canada and who intend to **reside in a province** other than the Province of Quebec.
    - According to section 77 of the IRPR, these requirements and criteria must be met on the date on which an **application is made** and on the date on which a permanent resident **visa is issued**.
    - it is helpful to divide the regulations for the Federal Skilled Worker Class into three parts:
        - The minimum requirements: s 75, s 76(1)(b) and s 82(1)(a), (b) or (d) of the IRPR
        - The criteria used to evaluate and admit: s 76 and s 85
        - Provisions detailing the application of each criterion: ss 77-83
    - the requirements of subsection **75(2)**:
        - **Previous work experience** in a skilled occupation, assessed using the National Occupational Classification (NOC).
        - Proficiency in an official **language**, based a language test administered by a designated institution and meeting thresholds established by the Minister.
        - A Canadian **educational** credential, or a foreign diploma along with an equivalency assessment.
    - 76(1)(b) establishes that to be accepted a skilled worker must have:
        - Sufficient settlement **funds** or
        - Points for arranged **employment**.
    - regarding ==work experience==, paragraphs 75(2)(a) to (c) establish that:
        - in the **10 years** before the date of application
        - the applicant must have accumulated over a **continuous period**
        - at least **1 year of full-time** work experience,
        - or the **equivalent in part-time** work,
        - in their **primary occupation** (as identified in their application)
        - other than in a **restricted** occupation, and
        - which is listed in **TEER Category 0, 1, 2 or 3** of the NOC (formerly Skill Type 0 Management Occupations or Skill Level A or B of the NOC matrix).
        - In addition, during the period of employment, the applicant:
            - must have performed “the actions described in the **lead statement** for the occupation” as set out in the NOC, and
            - must have performed “a substantial number of the **main duties** of the occupation as set out in the occupational descriptions” of the NOC, “including all of the essential duties.”
    - ==Settlement Funds== or Arranged Employment. s 76(1)(b) of the IRPR states that the skilled worker must:
        - (i) have in the form of **transferable and available funds**, unencumbered by debts or other obligations, an amount equal to **one half of the minimum necessary income** applicable in respect of the group of persons consisting of the **skilled worker and their family members**, **or**
        - (ii) be awarded points under paragraph 82(2)(a), (b) or (d) for **arranged employment**, as defined in subsection 82(1), in Canada
    - A similar requirement applies under the Federal Skilled Trades Class (see IRPR, s 87.2(3)(d)(ii), (iii) and (v) and (5)), but **not** the Canadian Experience Class.
    - Essential Case Review. These requirements are the subject of *Gugliotti v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2017 FC 71](http://canlii.ca/t/gx2cl){:target="\_blank"}.
        - [34] I agree with the Applicant that the **regulations do not specify the manner of proof of the required financial information to be filed**. While the regulations do set out the requirement to provide proof of settlement funds, they do not specify what is, or is not accepted as proof; they are silent as to the means by which an applicant may satisfy the obligation to demonstrate sufficient establishment funds. All parties are in agreement to this point as is the Court.
        - [36] It is also trite to observe that **if a Visa Officer has concerns with the reliability of documents, and reasonably requests addition information to weigh or assess the evidence filed, an Applicant may either provide that information or be prepared to see his or her application denied.** There is no suggestion that a Visa Officer must obtain regulatory approval before reasonably asking for further and better verification; the authority to demand more, assuming it is reasonably exercised, flows directly from, and in my view is inextricably bound up with, the Officers’ duty to weigh and assess the evidence before them.
        - [39] I should note that **no one suggested requiring this extra level of verification is in any way unreasonable**; an applicant merely need his or her financial institution to send an official letter in relation to its records which in my respectful view is quite reasonable. It is no different than asking a person who submits a photocopy of a property deed to provide a notarial copy where reasonable, or asking a person who submits a photocopy of a letter to provide the original where reasonable. And it makes no difference, in my view, if requirements for verification are made known before or after the material is submitted, although common sense suggests it is preferable for all concerned that applicants know in advance, as was the case here.
    - to exempt an applicant from the need to prove they have adequate settlement funds, the ==arranged employment== must be one of three kinds:
        - Under paragraph 82(2)(a) of the IRPR, LMIA-based or exempted job offer.
        - TEER 0, 1, 2 or 3.
    - **Summary**. Minimum Requirements for admission to permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Worker Class:
        - **One’s year of work continuous, full-time work** experience in a skilled occupation, assessed using the **TEER Category 0, 1, 2 or 3** of the NOC (formerly Skill Type 0 Management Occupations or Skill Level A or B of the NOC matrix), **within the previous 10 years**.
        - Sufficient proficiency in an official **language**, as demonstrated by the results of a language test administered by a designated institution within the **last two years** and meeting thresholds established by the Minister.
        - In the case of the Federal Skilled Worker Class, that means the applicant must have attained **level 7** for each language skill area under the Canadian Language Benchmarks or the Niveaux de competence linguistique canadiens.
        - A Canadian **educational credential**, or a foreign diploma along with an equivalency assessment that is less than five years old.
        - Either transferable and available **funds**, unencumbered by debt, amounting to 1/2 of the minimum income necessary to support the applicant’s family or points for **arranged employment** under three defined situations.

??? note "FSW Class: The Points System"

    - The starting point for understanding the regulatory point system for the Federal Skilled Worker Class is the list of selection criteria set out in paragraph **76(1)(a)** of the IRPR.
    - **Six** criteria: education, proficiency in an official language, experience, age, arranged employment, and adaptability.
    - Subsection **76(2)** says that the Minister must fix the number of points based on **three factors**: the number of skilled worker applications currently being **processed**, the number of skilled workers **projected** to become permanent residents, and the **potential** for the establishment of skilled workers in Canada.
    - For many years, the minimum number of points has been fixed at ==67==.
        - Education: s 78
        - Language: s 79
        - Experience: s 80 (must be in an occupation listed in TEER Category 0,1, 2 or 3)
        - Age: s 81
        - Arranged employment: ss 82, 83
            - to receive points, the employment offer must fall within one of four different categories:
                - First, paragraph 82(2)(a) of the IRPR applies in the case of applicants who are in Canada
                - Second, paragraph 82(2)(b) of the IRPR also applies to cases where an applicant is in Canada
                - Third, paragraph 82(2)(c) of the IRPR covers cases where an applicant is not authorized to work in Canada on the date of their application but has received an offer that meets the definition of “arranged employment” and which has been approved by an immigration officer based on a positive LMIA
                - Finally, paragraph 82(2)(d) of the IRPR awards points where the applicant is working in Canada either under a valid work permit or they are authorized to work in Canada without a permit
        - Adaptability: s 83

??? note "Exploring Substituted Evaluation"

    - The criteria used in assigning points under the points system to see whether an applicant [obtains the pass mark of 67 points](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/federal-skilled-workers/six-selection-factors-federal-skilled-workers.html){:target="\_blank"}.
    - Circumstances for officer’s substituted evaluation. Subsections **76(3) and (4)** of the IRPR state:
        - (3) Whether or not the skilled worker has been awarded the minimum number of required points referred to in subsection (2), an officer may **substitute** for the criteria set out in paragraph (1)(a) their evaluation of the likelihood of the ability of the skilled worker to become economically established in Canada if the number of points awarded is not a sufficient indicator of whether the skilled worker may become economically established in Canada.
        - (4) An evaluation made under subsection (3) requires the **concurrence** of a second officer.
    - IRCC’s [online operational instructions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/federal-skilled-workers/making-selection-decision.html){:target="\_blank"} for substituted evaluation decisions provide guidance to officers on how to make substituted evaluation decisions under subsections 76(3) and (4) of the IRPR.
    - Now comes the tricky part: since the implementation of Express Entry in January 2015, all new FSW applications have been processed in that system, with a set of Ministerial Instructions. You will see in the **Departmental guidance** above that substituted evaluation does **not apply** to Ministerial Instructions.

??? note "CEC Regulations"

    - Unlike the Federal Skilled Worker Class, selection under the Canadian Experience Class is on a **pass-fail basis** rather than assigning an applicant points. As its name suggests, membership in the class is determined by whether you have the requisite **Canadian** experience—meaning **work experience**.
    - The regulations for the Canadian Experience Class are found in a single provision, **section 87.1**.
    - Paragraphs 87.1(2)(a) to (c) state that an applicant must have acquired in the **previous 3 years** at least **1 year's full-time** work experience, or the **equivalent in part-time** work, in one or more occupations that are listed in TEER 0,1,2,3
        - In *Kumar*, the Court said “the real question for the visa officer is to determine the pith and substance of the work performed by the Applicant.”
    - Paragraph 87.1(2)(d) and (e) state that the applicant must submit the results of an approved language test that is less than 2 years’ old.
        - For occupations in **TEER 0 or 1** (formerly Skill Type 0 or Skill Level A), applicants must achieve at least Canadian Language Benchmark **(CLB) 7** for each language ability.
        - For occupations in **TEER 2 or 3** (formerly Skill Level B), applicants must achieve **CLB 5** for each language ability.
    - Qin v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), [2013 FCA 263](https://canlii.ca/t/g1wrc){:target="\_blank"}
        - Is it permissible for a visa officer to consider comparator salary data when assessing the nature of the work experience of an applicant who wishes to qualify as a member of the Canadian Experience Class, as described in section 87.1 of the IRPR?
            - ==Yes==
        - What standard of review is applicable to a visa officer’s interpretation of the IRPR and to the officer’s assessment of an application under the IRPR?
            - ==Correctness== is the applicable standard in this case for reviewing the visa officer’s interpretation of IRPR
            - ==reasonableness== is the standard of review of a visa officer’s **findings of fact** and **application of section 87.1 to the facts** of a CEC application

## Quizzes

??? note "Knowledge Check 4.1: Federal Skilled Worker Class Regulations"

    1. Joan has been invited to apply for permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Worker Class. She has arranged employment to work in Toronto as a mathematician and is currently in Toronto under a new work permit that was issued based on a positive Labour Market Impact Assessment, or LMIA. She is married, with a child (12 years old) from a previous marriage. Her husband, Paul, has three children (ages 14, 16, and 20), also from a previous marriage. Pauls' ex-wife, Ann, lives in Toronto, where Joan and Paul are planning to live. Ann is now married to Gemma. Together, Ann and Gemma have adopted two children (ages 4 and 6). Gemma has a daughter from a previous marriage who is 24 and who has always relied on her financially and continues to do so. Gemma cannot get a job because she is a recovering drug addict. What amount of settlement funds must Joan prove she has available to her?
        - [ ] C$31,638
        - [ ] C$16,570
        - [ ] $20,371
        - [x] None
        > Answer: **Joan need not prove she has any settlement funds, since she has arranged employment.** Under paragraph 76(1)(b) of the IRPR, she need only show she has sufficient settlement funds if she has not received arranged employment under either IRPR, ss 82(2)(a), (b) or (d). The arranged employment described in this case seems to fall under IRPR, s 82(2)(d).

    2. After having received an invitation, your client is applying for permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Worker Class. He enters his occupation as "mechanical engineer" (NOC 21301). The reference letter from his employer states that he:

        "managed projects, and prepared cost and timing estimates; reviewed and approve designs, calculations and cost estimates; prepared contract documents and evaluated tenders for industrial construction or maintenance; analyzed the dynamics and vibrations of mechanical systems and structures; and supervised technicians, technologists and other engineers."

        According to this statement, does your client meet the requirements of paragraph 75(2)(c) of the IRPR?  You will have to look up "mechanical engineer" in the National Occupational Classification to answer.

        - [x] Yes
        - [ ] No
        > Answer: Yes, but it should be acknowledged that it is borderline. **This statement approximately corresponds a few of the main duties listed for mechanical engineers.** That leaves the officer some discretion to refuse the application on the ground that the requirements of paragraph 75(2)(c) are not sufficiently met.

    3. Your client, Li Hui Chen, has an offer to come to Canada to work as a benefits officer, specifically working in payroll administration. He has also worked as a benefits officer (NOC 13102) for the past 10 years in China. He has $14,000 in settlement funds. The position will be full-time and will last at least one year. Can Mr. Chen apply through the Federal Skilled Worker Class from China?
        - [x] Yes
        - [ ] No

    4. After having received an invitation, your client is applying for permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Worker Class. He enters his occupation as "financial manager" (NOC 10010). The reference letter from his employer states that he:

        "oversaw our company's financial department, which includes accounting. In that role, he planned, organized and evaluated on an ongoing basis, through annual reviews based on performance standards, the policies and operations of the financial department. He was responsible for reporting on the financial health of the company to the Chief Executive Officer."

        Does this statement meet the requirements of paragraph 75(2)(c) of the IRPR? You will have to look up "financial managers" in the National Occupational Classification to answer.

        - [ ] Yes
        - [x] No
        > Answer: No. The statement shows that the client performed the actions in the **lead statement** for financial managers. That, however, is the requirement in **paragraph 75(2)(b)**. It does not however go on to demonstrate that he performed a substantial number of the **main duties**, including all the essential duties, for the occupation, as **paragraph 75(2)(c)** requires.

    5. In your exploration of this topic, you were instructed to read the Gugliotti case. Which of the following statements best encapsulates the principal holding in that case?
        - [ ] While a visa officer may ask for additional verification of financial statements, this additional request must be authorized by a ministerial instruction.
        - [ ] The immigration officer improperly fettered her discretion by imposing a requirement (a verification letter from a financial institution) that is not found in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.
        - [x] It is reasonable to base a decision on a policy requiring additional verification by a financial institution of an applicant's available funds. No specific regulatory authorization of this requirement is necessary.
        - [ ] Settlement funds may not include amounts invested in mutual funds.

    6. Paolo wants to come to Canada as a permanent resident to live in Trois-Rivières. He asks you if he can apply to do so under the Federal Skilled Worker Class. What do you answer?
        - [ ] Yes
        - [x] No
        > No. It is a requirement of the **Federal Skilled Worker Class** that you do **not intend to reside in Quebec**.

    7. True or false: The Court in Gugliotti v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), 2017 FC 71, held that when a visa officer is requesting more supporting documents from the Applicant, they must obtain regulatory approval before asking for further and better verification.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False

    8. Jean is a citizen of France. He has been invited to apply for permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Worker Class. He is married to Saul, a citizen of the United Kingdom. Jean has a biological daughter (Audrey, 8 years old) from a previous marriage. Saul has a biological son (Mack, aged 12) also from a previous marriage.

        Saul's ex-wife, Anita, is a Canadian citizen and lives in Montreal, although Jean and Saul are planning to live in Edmonton. Anita is now married to Herbert, also a Canadian citizen. Anita and Herbert have no children together, but Herbert has a 28-year-old biological daughter, Barbara, from a previous marriage. Barbara is a Canadian citizen, but she lives and works in New York City with her boyfriend; they are both highly successful lawyers.

        Jean can provide a letter showing that he has $23,921 in unencumbered funds. Does he have sufficient settlement funds for his application to be accepted?

        - [ ] Yes
        - [x] No
        > Answer: No. Since there is no mention of arranged employment, Jean must show he has **1/2 the minimum necessary income necessary to support his family members** (IRPR, s **76(1)(b)(i)**). His family members include himself and his spouse and their dependent children (IRPR, s 1(3)). Here that means that he must show he has 1/2 the minimum necessary income to **support 4 people** (himself, Saul, and their two biological children). According to the table provided by IRCC, that means he needs $27,297 in settlement funds (as of 28 May 2024). This answer may change in subsequent years, since the low-income cut-offs are recalculated each year by Statistics Canada.

    9. Marco has been working in Guelph, Ontario for 2 years as a barber. He is a French citizen and wants to become a permanent resident and move to Montreal. He thinks he can transition smoothly given his fluency in French. He asks you if he can apply under the Canadian Experience Class given his plans. What do you answer?
        - [ ] Yes
        - [x] No
        > No. It is a requirement of the Canadian Experience Class that you do **not intend to reside in Quebec**.

    10. Your client, Hyun Bin, has an offer to come to Canada to work as a financial auditor to work for Deloitte. The position will be full-time and will last at least one year. He has just graduated from his accounting program. Prior to returning to school, he worked as an accounting clerk (NOC 14200) for 6 of the past 10 years in South Korea. Does Hyun Bin's work experience qualify him to apply through the Federal Skilled Worker Class ?
        - [ ] Yes
        - [x] No
        > No. He does not have 1 year of experience in a high skilled NOC in the past 10 years, as required by IRPR, s **75(2)(a)**. Accounting Clerk is a TEER level 4 occupation.

    11. Tyson has been invited to apply for permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Worker Class. He has arranged employment as a mechanical engineer at the Toronto Transit Commission. He has received a positive Labour Market Impact Assessment, however is not yet working in Canada. Ayson recently married Irina, and they are expecting a baby in three months. Irina also has custody of her 8-year-old daughter from a previous marriage. What amount of settlement funds must Ayson prove he has available to him?
        - [ ] C$34,299
        - [x] C$22,483
        - [ ] C$19,836
        - [ ] None
        > Despite the fact that Tyson has arranged employment, he still needs to show that he has sufficient settlement funds, because **he is not currently holding a work permit in Canada**. Under paragraph **76(1)(b)** of the IRPR, he either needs to show that he has sufficient settlement funds OR that he is awarded points under ss **82(2)(a), (b) or (d)** of the IRPR for arranged employment as defined in ss 82(1), in Canada.

??? note "Knowledge Check 4.2: Federal Skilled Worker Class - The Points System"

    1. Your client, Yibo Wang, is a Chinese citizen who has been working in Canada for his employer since August 15, 2019 as a pharmacology researcher with Apotex Inc.

        His work permit did not require an LMIA because he held an open work permit based on his spouse's high skilled employment in Canada. He has recently left Apotex for Teva Pharmaceuticals, which offered him a better position with higher pay.

        He wants to apply for permanent residence, can he get points for arranged employment?
        - [ ] Yes
        - [x] No
        > Answer: No. This scenario is **not described in paragraph 82(2)** of the IRPR. He holds an open work permit.

    2. Your client is an American citizen who has been working in Canada for her employer since September 1, 2021 as a consumer advisor under a LMIA-backed work permit. She wants to apply for permanent residence and her employer is willing to extend her a job offer of continuous, full-time employment of at least one year. It is now August 15, 2022. If she files her application now, can she receive points for arranged employment?
        - [x] Yes
        - [ ] No
        > Yes. Because **her work permit was based on a positive LMIA, there is no requirement that she have worked for her employer for one year**. Therefore, she can receive points for arranged employment under paragraph 82(2)(a) and EE MI section 29.

    3. Your client's common-law partner's older sister is a permanent resident of Canada living in Winnipeg. Is your client entitled to points for adaptability under the FSW points system?
        - [x] Yes
        - [ ] No
        > Answer: Yes. They are likely entitled to 5 points under paragraph **83(1)(d)**.

    4. Your client is a Mexican citizen who has been working in Canada for his employer since December 15, 2019 as a civil engineer under a work permit for which an LMIA was not required because the position is covered by the CUSMA. He has received a job offer to continue in the position with the same employer. It is now January 15, 2021. If he files his application now, can he receive points for arranged employment?
        - [x] Yes
        - [ ] No
        > Answer: Yes. Under paragraph **82(2)(b)** of the IRPR, **an applicant must have accumulated at least 1 year of continuous, full-time employment** from the employer who has made them an offer in order to receive points for arranged employment. This client has just passed the 1-year mark.

    5. Your client's spouse wrote the Test d'évaluation de français pour le Canada and results were issued to her on 1 September 2019. Her scores were as follows: 130 for reading, 226 for writing, 145 for listening and 120 for speaking. Can your client claim adaptability points under the FSW points system based on these test scores?
        - [ ] Yes
        - [x] No
        > Answer: No. The 120 score for speaking is below the required threshold of benchmark level 4 under the Niveaux de compétence linguistique canadiens. Also, the results are now more than 2 years old.

    6. Your client is an Armenian citizen who has been working in Canada for his employer since September 1, 2021 as a biomedical researcher under a work permit for which an LMIA was not required because his job creates economic benefits for Canadians. He wants to apply for permanent residence but also change employers. If he secures an offer from someone else, can he get points for arranged employment?
        - [ ] Yes
        - [x] No
        > Answer: No. This is the scenario described in paragraph **82(2)(b)** of the IRPR. However, to get points for arranged employment under 82(2)(b), he has to have accumulated at least **one year of full-time work** experience over a continuous period of work for the employer also providing him the full-time job offer (see IRPR, s. 205(a) and s. 82(2)(b)(iii)) and EE MI section 29.

    7. One year ago, your client, who has just turned 18 years old, came to Canada for a 4-week exchange program at a local high school, during which she also followed a short intensive program at a nearby university. This program was designed to attract high school students to study at Canadian universities. Is she entitled to points for adaptability under the FSW points system?
        - [ ] Yes
        - [x] No
        > This scenario is not covered by any of the possibilities under IRPR, s 83. The closest fit, paragraph **83(1)(b)**, **requires at least 2 academic years** in Canada.

    8. Your client, Vincenzia Pomadora, is an Italian citizen who has been working in Canada for her employer since February 1, 2020 as an actuary under a LMIA-backed work permit.

        She wants to apply for permanent residence and her employer has extended a job offer of continuous, full-time employment. She will be under probation on an initial contract for 6 months, after which the contract will be renewed on an indeterminate basis.

        It is now July 15, 2020. If she files her application now, is she likely to receive points for arranged employment?
        - [ ] Yes
        - [x] No
        > Because her contract must be renewed after 6 months, the job offer will likely **not be construed as an offer for 1-year**'s continuous, full-time employment.

    9. Your client is an American citizen who has been working in Canada for her employer since April 1, 2022 as a consumer advisor (TEER 1) under a LMIA-backed work permit.

        She wants to apply for permanent residence and her employer is willing to extend her a job offer of continuous, full-time employment. She will however be under probation on an initial contract for 9 months, after which contract will be renewed on an indeterminate basis.

        It is now September 15, 2022. If she files her application now, is she likely to receive points for arranged employment?
        - [ ] Yes
        - [x] No
        > Because her contract must be renewed after 9 months, the job offer will likely **not be construed as an offer for 1-year**'s continuous, full-time employment.

    10. Your client, Orisa Robertson is a British citizen who has been working in Canada for her employer since September 12, 2020 as a nanotech scientist under a LMIA-backed work permit. She wants to apply for permanent residence and her employer is willing to extend her a job offer of continuous, full-time employment of at least 1 year. It is now June 30, 2021. If she files her application now, can she receive points for arranged employment?
        - [x] Yes
        - [ ] No
        > Because her work permit was **based on a positive LMIA**, there is **no requirement that she have worked for her employer for 1 year**. She can receive points for arranged employment under paragraph 82(2)(a).

    11. Five years ago, your client, Yiyun Li, finished a 3-year program at George Brown College's culinary arts program. She is now applying from China for permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Worker (FSW) Class. Is she entitled to points for adaptability under the FSW points system?
        - [ ] Yes
        - [x] No
        > She is likely entitled to 5 points under IRPR, s 83(1)(b)

    12. Your client's common law partner wrote the IELTS and has CLB 7 for all language skill areas. Can your client claim adaptability points under the FSW points system based on these test scores?
        - [x] Yes
        - [ ] No
        > The client is entitled to 5 points as their common law partner scored higher than CLB 4 for each of the four language skill areas. See IRPR, s 83(1)(a).

    13. Your client is an American citizen who has been working in Canada for his employer since September 1, 2021 of last year as an engineer under a work permit for which an LMIA was not required because the position is covered by the CUSMA.

        - [ ] Yes
        - [x] No
        > Under paragraph 82(2)(b) of the IRPR and EE MI section 29, an applicant must have accumulated at least 1 year of continuous, full-time employment from the employer who has made them an offer in order to receive points for arranged employment. A CUSMA work permit is a IRPR s. 204 work permit.

??? note "Knowledge Check 4.3: Canadian Experience Class Regulations"

    1. Seri Yoon, a citizen of South Korea, wishes to apply to come to Canada under the Canadian Experience Class, based on their experience working in Manitoba as a water treatment plant operator (TEER 2) over the past year. Seri achieved the following scores under the IELTS: reading, 4.5; writing, 5.0; listening, 4.5; speaking, 4.5. Will their application be accepted?
        - [ ] Yes
        - [x] No
        > Because their experience is in an occupation classified as TEER 2 in the NOC, Seri must attain Canadian Level Benchmark (CLB) 5 in each language skill area. Seri's listening and speaking scores are 4.5 which is equivalent to CLB 4, which is below the minimum benchmark.

    2. True or false: Past studies in Canada is among one of the criteria that can lead to qualifying for the Canadian Experience Class.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        > While previous studies were once a basis for acceptance under the Canadian Experience Class, that possibility was removed in 2013.

    3. *Patil v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2020 FC 495](http://canlii.ca/t/j6mxv){:target="\_blank"} involves a similar issue to the one at issue in Qin. The immigration officer in Patil also refused an application after taking into account the wages of the applicant, a citizen of India. Justice Ahmed, however, found in his case that the officer had erred.

        Please turn to *Patil* and answer the following question: Given the authority in Qin, did Justice Ahmed err in reaching his conclusion?
        - [ ] Yes
        - [x] No
        > No. In *Patil*, Justice Ahmed allowed the judicial review on the basis that the officer's decision was procedurally unfair. The officer's notes revealed that the applicant's wages gave rise to credibility concerns. When there are credibility concerns (see para 41) or an "overall skepticism" regarding an applicant's claim, the applicant must be given notice and an opportunity to respond. (In any event, in Qin, it was agreed that there had been a breach of procedural fairness quite apart from the substantive issue determined by the Federal Court of Appeal.)

    4. In *Qin v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, 2013 FCA 263, Justice Evans found that the salary paid to an applicant for employment in Canada is a criterion for acceptance under the Canadian Experience Class.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        > At para 48 of Qin, Justice Evans writes:
        > it is not a statutory condition to the grant of a visa under the CEC program that an applicant's wages must be consistent with the prevailing local wage rates for the occupation in which the applicant is being assessed. Wages are simply one of the many considerations that may be relevant to determining whether a CEC applicant satisfies the prescribed work experience requirement.
        > In other words, **wages are relevant, but they are not a criterion for acceptance**.

    5. Eligibility for permanent residence through the Canadian Experience Class is determined by work experience and education credentials.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        > Though formerly education was taken into account, access to permanent residence through the Canadian Experience Class is determined entirely by previous work experience in Canada and language ability.

    6. Based on Justice Ahmed's reasons in Patil, would it have been open to the officer to reject the application on the basis that the letter did not establish that the applicant had sufficient qualifying work experience?
        - [ ] Yes
        - [x] No
        > No. Justice Ahmed notes that **the officer did not find that the employment letter "did not accurately or sufficiently list the required duties of [the applicant's**] claimed position[.]" This distinguishes the case from Qin, where there were doubts about the sufficiency of the applicant's employment letter.

    7. In *Qin v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, 2013 FCA 263, Justice Evans found that when the Officer was assessing probative evidence before them, they must rely on express statutory authority to do so.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        > **Express statutory authority is not required to enable administrative decision-makers to consider evidence** that has probative value with respect to a question entrusted to them. It is normally implicit in the grant of legal authority to decide a question of fact that the decision-maker may consider evidence relevant to making that decision.

    8.  In *Patil v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, 2020 FC 495, why did the court find that the Officer breached procedural fairness?
        - [x] The Officer was skeptical of the Applicant's credibility, and the Applicant was therefore owed an opportunity to address the Officer's concerns.
        - [ ] The Officer speculated as to why the Applicant remained at his job position with a low salary.
        - [ ] The Officer did not consider the Applicant's evidence as a whole.
        - [ ] The Officer did not come to a reasonable conclusion in light of all the evidence.

    9. True or false:  Eligibility for permanent residence through the Canadian Experience Class is determined by work experience and education credentials.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        > Though formerly education was taken into account, access to permanent residence through the Canadian Experience Class is determined entirely by previous work experience in Canada and language ability.
