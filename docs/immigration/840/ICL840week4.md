??? note "FSW: Minimum Requirements"

    - R75(1): For the purposes of subsection 12(2) of the Act, the federal skilled worker class is hereby prescribed as a class of persons who are skilled workers and who may become permanent residents on the basis of their ability to become **economically established** in Canada and who intend to **reside in a province** other than the Province of Quebec.
    - According to section 77 of the IRPR, these requirements and criteria must be met on the date on which an **application is made** and on the date on which a permanent resident **visa is issued**.
    - it is helpful to divide the regulations for the Federal Skilled Worker Class into three parts:
        - The minimum requirements: s 75, s 76(1)(b) and s 82(1)(a), (b) or (d) of the IRPR
        - The criteria used to evaluate and admit: s 76 and s 85
        - Provisions detailing the application of each criterion: ss 77-83
    - the requirements of subsection **75(2)**:
        - **Previous work experience** in a skilled occupation, assessed using the National Occupational Classification (NOC).
        - Proficiency in an official **language**, based a language test administered by a designated institution and meeting thresholds established by the Minister.
        - A Canadian **educational** credential, or a foreign diploma along with an equivalency assessment.
    - 76(1)(b) establishes that to be accepted a skilled worker must have:
        - Sufficient settlement **funds** or
        - Points for arranged **employment**.
    - regarding ==work experience==, paragraphs 75(2)(a) to (c) establish that:
        - in the **10 years** before the date of application
        - the applicant must have accumulated over a **continuous period**
        - at least **1 year of full-time** work experience,
        - or the **equivalent in part-time** work,
        - in their **primary occupation** (as identified in their application)
        - other than in a **restricted** occupation, and
        - which is listed in **TEER Category 0, 1, 2 or 3** of the NOC (formerly Skill Type 0 Management Occupations or Skill Level A or B of the NOC matrix).
        - In addition, during the period of employment, the applicant:
            - must have performed “the actions described in the **lead statement** for the occupation” as set out in the NOC, and
            - must have performed “a substantial number of the **main duties** of the occupation as set out in the occupational descriptions” of the NOC, “including all of the essential duties.”
    - ==Settlement Funds== or Arranged Employment. s 76(1)(b) of the IRPR states that the skilled worker must:
        - (i) have in the form of **transferable and available funds**, unencumbered by debts or other obligations, an amount equal to **one half of the minimum necessary income** applicable in respect of the group of persons consisting of the **skilled worker and their family members**, **or**
        - (ii) be awarded points under paragraph 82(2)(a), (b) or (d) for **arranged employment**, as defined in subsection 82(1), in Canada
    - A similar requirement applies under the Federal Skilled Trades Class (see IRPR, s 87.2(3)(d)(ii), (iii) and (v) and (5)), but **not** the Canadian Experience Class.
    - Essential Case Review. These requirements are the subject of *Gugliotti v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2017 FC 71](http://canlii.ca/t/gx2cl){:target="\_blank"}.
        - [34] I agree with the Applicant that the **regulations do not specify the manner of proof of the required financial information to be filed**. While the regulations do set out the requirement to provide proof of settlement funds, they do not specify what is, or is not accepted as proof; they are silent as to the means by which an applicant may satisfy the obligation to demonstrate sufficient establishment funds. All parties are in agreement to this point as is the Court.
        - [36] It is also trite to observe that **if a Visa Officer has concerns with the reliability of documents, and reasonably requests addition information to weigh or assess the evidence filed, an Applicant may either provide that information or be prepared to see his or her application denied.** There is no suggestion that a Visa Officer must obtain regulatory approval before reasonably asking for further and better verification; the authority to demand more, assuming it is reasonably exercised, flows directly from, and in my view is inextricably bound up with, the Officers’ duty to weigh and assess the evidence before them.
        - [39] I should note that **no one suggested requiring this extra level of verification is in any way unreasonable**; an applicant merely need his or her financial institution to send an official letter in relation to its records which in my respectful view is quite reasonable. It is no different than asking a person who submits a photocopy of a property deed to provide a notarial copy where reasonable, or asking a person who submits a photocopy of a letter to provide the original where reasonable. And it makes no difference, in my view, if requirements for verification are made known before or after the material is submitted, although common sense suggests it is preferable for all concerned that applicants know in advance, as was the case here.
    - to exempt an applicant from the need to prove they have adequate settlement funds, the ==arranged employment== must be one of three kinds:
        - Under paragraph 82(2)(a) of the IRPR, LMIA-based or exempted job offer.
        - TEER 0, 1, 2 or 3.
    - **Summary**. Minimum Requirements for admission to permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Worker Class:
        - **One’s year of work continuous, full-time work** experience in a skilled occupation, assessed using the **TEER Category 0, 1, 2 or 3** of the NOC (formerly Skill Type 0 Management Occupations or Skill Level A or B of the NOC matrix), **within the previous 10 years**.
        - Sufficient proficiency in an official **language**, as demonstrated by the results of a language test administered by a designated institution within the **last two years** and meeting thresholds established by the Minister.
        - In the case of the Federal Skilled Worker Class, that means the applicant must have attained **level 7** for each language skill area under the Canadian Language Benchmarks or the Niveaux de competence linguistique canadiens.
        - A Canadian **educational credential**, or a foreign diploma along with an equivalency assessment that is less than five years old.
        - Either transferable and available **funds**, unencumbered by debt, amounting to 1/2 of the minimum income necessary to support the applicant’s family or points for **arranged employment** under three defined situations.

## Quizzes

???+ note "Knowledge Check 4.1: Federal Skilled Worker Class Regulations"

    1. Joan has been invited to apply for permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Worker Class. She has arranged employment to work in Toronto as a mathematician and is currently in Toronto under a new work permit that was issued based on a positive Labour Market Impact Assessment, or LMIA. She is married, with a child (12 years old) from a previous marriage. Her husband, Paul, has three children (ages 14, 16, and 20), also from a previous marriage. Pauls' ex-wife, Ann, lives in Toronto, where Joan and Paul are planning to live. Ann is now married to Gemma. Together, Ann and Gemma have adopted two children (ages 4 and 6). Gemma has a daughter from a previous marriage who is 24 and who has always relied on her financially and continues to do so. Gemma cannot get a job because she is a recovering drug addict. What amount of settlement funds must Joan prove she has available to her?
        - [ ] C$31,638
        - [ ] C$16,570
        - [ ] $20,371
        - [x] None
        > Answer: **Joan need not prove she has any settlement funds, since she has arranged employment.** Under paragraph 76(1)(b) of the IRPR, she need only show she has sufficient settlement funds if she has not received arranged employment under either IRPR, ss 82(2)(a), (b) or (d). The arranged employment described in this case seems to fall under IRPR, s 82(2)(d).

    2. After having received an invitation, your client is applying for permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Worker Class. He enters his occupation as "mechanical engineer" (NOC 21301). The reference letter from his employer states that he:

        "managed projects, and prepared cost and timing estimates; reviewed and approve designs, calculations and cost estimates; prepared contract documents and evaluated tenders for industrial construction or maintenance; analyzed the dynamics and vibrations of mechanical systems and structures; and supervised technicians, technologists and other engineers."

        According to this statement, does your client meet the requirements of paragraph 75(2)(c) of the IRPR?  You will have to look up "mechanical engineer" in the National Occupational Classification to answer.

        - [x] Yes
        - [ ] No
        > Answer: Yes, but it should be acknowledged that it is borderline. **This statement approximately corresponds a few of the main duties listed for mechanical engineers.** That leaves the officer some discretion to refuse the application on the ground that the requirements of paragraph 75(2)(c) are not sufficiently met.

    3. Your client, Li Hui Chen, has an offer to come to Canada to work as a benefits officer, specifically working in payroll administration. He has also worked as a benefits officer (NOC 13102) for the past 10 years in China. He has $14,000 in settlement funds. The position will be full-time and will last at least one year. Can Mr. Chen apply through the Federal Skilled Worker Class from China?
        - [x] Yes
        - [ ] No

    4. After having received an invitation, your client is applying for permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Worker Class. He enters his occupation as "financial manager" (NOC 10010). The reference letter from his employer states that he:

        "oversaw our company's financial department, which includes accounting. In that role, he planned, organized and evaluated on an ongoing basis, through annual reviews based on performance standards, the policies and operations of the financial department. He was responsible for reporting on the financial health of the company to the Chief Executive Officer."

        Does this statement meet the requirements of paragraph 75(2)(c) of the IRPR? You will have to look up "financial managers" in the National Occupational Classification to answer.

        - [ ] Yes
        - [x] No
        > Answer: No. The statement shows that the client performed the actions in the **lead statement** for financial managers. That, however, is the requirement in **paragraph 75(2)(b)**. It does not however go on to demonstrate that he performed a substantial number of the **main duties**, including all the essential duties, for the occupation, as **paragraph 75(2)(c)** requires.

    5. In your exploration of this topic, you were instructed to read the Gugliotti case. Which of the following statements best encapsulates the principal holding in that case?
        - [ ] While a visa officer may ask for additional verification of financial statements, this additional request must be authorized by a ministerial instruction.
        - [ ] The immigration officer improperly fettered her discretion by imposing a requirement (a verification letter from a financial institution) that is not found in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act.
        - [x] It is reasonable to base a decision on a policy requiring additional verification by a financial institution of an applicant's available funds. No specific regulatory authorization of this requirement is necessary.
        - [ ] Settlement funds may not include amounts invested in mutual funds.
