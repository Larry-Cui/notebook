??? note "Start-up Business Class"

    - The Start-Up Business Class began as a 5-year pilot program launched using ministerial instructions in 2013. The federal government made the class permanent in **2018**.
    - The current regulations for the Start-Up Business Class are now found in sections 98.01 to 98.13 of the IRPR.
    - the **Start-Up Business Class**, the **Self-Employed Persons Class**, and **Quebec business immigration classes**.
    - Subsection 98.01(1) of the IRPR establishes the Start-Up Business Class as a class of persons who may become permanent residents
        - on the basis of their ability to become **economically established** in Canada,
        - who meet the requirements of **subsection (2)**, and
        - who intend to **reside** in a province or territory other than Quebec.
    - Subsection 98.01(2) then sets out the main requirements for the class:
        - The applicant must demonstrate official **language** proficiency through an approved language test. (CLB 5)
        - The applicant must have sufficient settlement **funds**. (50% of LICO, [online guide](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/proof-funds-start-business-class.html){:target="\_blank"})
        - The applicant must have started a **qualifying business**.
        - The applicant must have obtained a **commitment** from a designated entity to support the business.
    - an applicant must have started a “qualifying business” and must have obtained a “commitment” from one or more “designated entities” that is less than 6 months old.
    - subsection 98.01(3) makes clear that **up to 5** foreign nationals can apply as founders of the same business.
    - **Rules for Qualifying Businesses**. There are four requirements established by subsection 98.06(1):
        - The applicant must provide **active and ongoing management** of the business.
        - That active and ongoing management must be from **within Canada**.
        - An **essential part** of the business’s operations must be **conducted in Canada**.
        - The business must be **incorporated** in Canada.
        - The business must have an **ownership structure** that complies with certain percentage requirements established by the Minister of IRCC.
    - Currently, the ownership structure requirements established by the Minister are:
        - that each applicant must hold **10% or more** of the voting rights attached to all outstanding shares of the corporation; and
        - that the applicants and the designated entity that has entered into a commitment with them **jointly hold more than 50%** of the total voting rights attached to all outstanding shares.

??? note "The Start-Up Business Class: Designated Entities and Commitments"

    - Three kinds of organizations may be designated, as set out in subsection 98.03(1):
        - **Business incubators**: The IRCC website currently lists over 40 designated business incubators.
        - **Angel investor groups**: The IRCC website currently lists 6 angel investors.
        - **Venture capital funds**: The IRCC website currently lists 26 venture capital funds.
    - To be designated, an organization must belong to one of 2 industry associations, the [Canadian Venture Capital & Private Equity Association](https://www.cvca.ca/membership/){:target="\_blank"} (for venture capital funds) or the [National Angel Capital Organization](https://www.nacocanada.com/cpages/start-up-visa){:target="\_blank"} (for angel investors and business incubators).
    - on April 30, 2024, the Minister announced Designated Entities would only be permitted to put forward [**10 applicants per year**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2024/04/changes-to-the-start-up-visa-and-self-employed-persons-programs-to-help-reduce-backlogs-and-improve-processing-times.html){:target="\_blank"}, essentially limiting the number of commitment certificates they can issue per year.
    - You can find definitions of “designated angel investor group”, “designated business incubator”, and “designated venture capital fund” on the [Glossary](https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html){:target="\_blank"} of the IRCC website.
    - One difference is **whose money is invested**. Angel investors are made up of members who invest their own capital in start-ups, usually in exchange for equity. Venture capital funds raise and manage capital from others to place equity investments in start-ups. The two kinds of organizations also offer different kinds of help.
    - **Physical space and facilities**. Angel investors also offer mentorship and networking; these are listed as among the kinds of support that venture capital funds provide. In addition, business incubators may provide “capital”, but while this is not listed among the services that venture capital funds provide, the very point of such funds is to provide capital.
    - **Criteria for Designation**. Under subsection 98.03(2) of the IRPR, the Minister designates business incubators, angel investors, and venture capital funds based on whether:
        - the entity is recognized for its expertise in assessing the potential for and assisting in the success of start-up business opportunities in Canada; and
        - it has the ability to assess the potential for and assist in the success of start-up business opportunities in Canada.
    - Failure to comply with these conditions by the entities may lead to the suspension or revocation of a designation under subsections 98.03(4) and 98.03(6).
    - **Commitments**. Designated angel investors, business incubators or venture capital funds must enter into “commitments” with an applicant who has started a qualifying business in order for the applicant to be a member of the Start-Up Business Class. The formal requirements in section 98.04 include that:
        - A commitment must be **in written or electronic form** and must be provided by the person with the authority to bind the designated entity.
        - It must include **information on each applicant** associated with the business.
        - It must identify the applicant or applicants considered by the designated entity as **essential** to the business.
        - The designated entity must **not** have charged a fee to review and assess the business proposal or business.
    - The **commitment certificate**, along with **a term sheet or client agreement**, must be sent to IRCC by the designated entity. The **letter of support** must be provided by the designated entity to the applicant. The letter must be submitted with the application.
    - If an essential applicant is identified, there are two consequences:
        - First, under subsection 98.08(2), if an essential applicant is **refused** for any reason or withdraws their application, other applicants applying in relation to the same the business will also be **refused** whether or not they meet the other requirements for the class. This was confirmed in *Damangir v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2024 FC 599](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2024/2024fc599/2024fc599.html?resultIndex=1&resultId=bff01525789341aaba33b063e8fe8ed0&searchId=2024-05-24T13:29:52:360/b1187cdba5a84d9f8f2a82c9091ea78b&searchUrlHash=AAAAAQATInN0YXJ0LXVwIGJ1c2luZXNzIgAAAAAB){:target="\_blank"}.
        - Second, the essential applicant can apply for a [**work permit**](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/start-visa/work-permits.html#2.0){:target="\_blank"} to come to Canada to work on the business even **before applying for permanent residence**. The designated entity must support the application for a work permit; specifically, the commitment certificate and the letter of support must indicate that there are “**urgent business reasons for [the essential applicant’s] early entry to Canada.**” Applicants must submit their application for permanent residence before the commitment certificate expires.
    - For how long is a commitment certificate valid?
        - Answer: According to paragraph 98.01(2)(a), a commitment certificate included in an application for permanent residence under the Start-Up Business Class must be **less than 6 months old**.
        - The operational instructions further state: Your work permit will only be valid for one year to allow you to begin working in Canada while your application for permanent residence (APR) is being processed. APRs used to be processed within a year, however are currently taking 3 years plus. However, if you need an extension, it will be considered on a case-by-case basis through the normal extension process.
    - Commitments from the different kinds of Designated Entities:
        - “a designated **angel investor** group confirming that it is investing at least **$75,000** in a qualifying business or 2 or more designated angel investor groups confirming that they are together investing a total of at least $75,000 in such a business”
        - “a designated **venture capital** fund confirming that it is investing at least **$200,000** in a qualifying business or 2 or more designated venture capital funds confirming that they are together investing a total of at least $200,000 in such a business”
        - “a designated business **incubator** confirming that it is accepting the applicant into its business incubator program.”
    - Requirements of the Commitment Certificate:
        - The commitment certificate must be issued **by 1 or more** designated entities.
        - It must be **less than 6 months old** on the date of application.
        - It must be issued **without** the designated entity charging a **fee** to review and assess the business proposal or to assess the business.
        - It must include **a term sheet/client agreement**.
        - It must include details of the **amount** of the investment and who is investing.
        - It must include details of the **services** to be provided by the designated entity to the applicant.
        - It must include details of **any fees** to be charged to the applicant by the designated entity (or other costs/exchange of funds) and when these fees will be collected.
        - It must include **information** on each applicant (no more than 5 persons may be identified in a commitment to a single business proposal).
        - It must describe the **relationship** between the applicant and the investment team.
        - It must describe the **business** and the applicant’s **role** in the business, including the applicant’s title and any tasks the applicant is expected to perform for the company.
        - It must identify those considered **essential** to the business.
    - In addition, the instructions sets out specific **requirements for term sheets or client agreement**, depending on whether the designated entity is an angel investor, business incubator, or venture capital fund.

??? note "The Start-Up Business Class: Evaluating Commitments and Substituted Evaluation"

    - subsection **98.08(1)** of the IRPR states:
        - If the officer is not satisfied that the entity assessed the applicant and the applicant’s business in a manner consistent with industry standards or is not satisfied that the terms of the commitment are consistent with industry standards, the officer may refuse to issue the permanent resident visa.
    - subsection 98.09(1) of the IRPR allows an officer to request that
        - a commitment, the applicants and designated entities party to the commitment and the qualifying business to which the commitment relates be **independently assessed by a peer review panel** established under an agreement referred to in section 98.02 by an organization that has expertise with respect to the type of entity making the commitment.
    - However, under subsection 98.09(4) the officer is **not bound by the review**.
    - Substituted Evaluation
        - section **98.10** of the IRPR provides for a power of **substituted evaluation**:
            - An officer may substitute their evaluation of the applicant’s ability to become economically established in Canada for the requirements set out in subsection 98.01(2), if meeting or failing to meet those requirements is not a sufficient indicator of whether the applicant will become economically established in Canada.
        - It allows the officer essentially to ove**r**ride the four criteria set out in subsection **98.01(2)** if they conclude those criteria do not reflect the applicant’s actual ability to become economically established in Canada. As with those other provisions, exercise of the power requires the **concurrence** of a second officer (see IRPR, s 98.10(3)).
        - Substituted evaluation cannot be used overcome an initial failure to obtain a commitment from a designated entity.

??? note "Start-Up Business Class: Legal Research Exercise"

    - According to the Federal Court case law, what seems to be the most **common ground for refusing** applications under the Start-Up Business Class?
        - A search for “**start-up business class**” in the Federal Court database on CanLII yielded 20 cases (the search was conducted on May 1, 2024). In 8 cases, the application was refused because the officer concluded that the applicants had embarked on the business and commitment for the **primary purpose** of acquiring a status or privilege under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).
    - What are some of the factors that have led visa officers to refuse applications on that basis?
        - Possible **conflicting venture**, *Kwan v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2019 FC 92 at para 3](https://canlii.ca/t/hx633#par3){:target="\_blank"}

        - **Lack of progress** in venture and **large fee paid** to incubator without notation on Commitment Certificate, *Ngyuen v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2020 FC 1126 para 53-57](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2020/2020fc1126/2020fc1126.html?searchUrlHash=AAAAAQAZInN0YXJ0LXVwIGJ1c2luZXNzIGNsYXNzIgAAAAAB&resultIndex=8){:target="\_blank"}
        - Small number of hours per week for essential applicant/**lack of meaningful engagement**, *Kwan v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2019 FC 92 at para 12](https://canlii.ca/t/hx633#par12){:target="\_blank"}
        - Not clear **why had to incorporate in Canada**, *Le v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2020 FC 734 at para 16](https://canlii.ca/t/j97kk#par16){:target="\_blank"}
        - Not clear what business **incubator’s role** in proposed venture would be, **Lack of transparency** between the business and the business incubator, and **Arrangement atypical** in Canadian accelerator and incubator industry, *Le v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2020 FC 734 at para 16](https://canlii.ca/t/j97kk#par16){:target="\_blank"}
        - **Failure to spend periods** of time in Canada necessary to work on business, *Le v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2020 FC 734 at para 21](https://canlii.ca/t/j97kk#par21){:target="\_blank"}

        - **Lack of education and experience** in the field, **Lack of intellectual property** and Whether **business idea** came from designated entity, *Truong v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2020 FC 779 at para 8](http://canlii.ca/t/j9fdb#par8){:target="\_blank"}

    - During a peer review of the commitment, does the applicant have a right to participate?
        - Under the current case law, your client does not have a right to attend and participate at the meeting. In *Bui v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2019 FC 440 at paragraph 36](http://canlii.ca/t/hzrhg#par36){:target="\_blank"}, Justice LeBlanc writes:
            - [36]  In my view, the Panel was not required to invite the Applicant to attend the peer review. This process, I repeat, is to examine if Empowered had conducted due diligence in accepting the Applicant’s business proposal, and does not focus on the conduct of the Applicant.

Bob obtained a commitment certificate and letter of support from NextGen, a business incubator program. Shortly after his application was submitted, IRCC suspended NextGen's designation. Bob writes you an email asking if that means his application will be refused?
        - [ ] Yes
        - [x] No
        > Not necessarily.  The operational instructions state that applications associated with commitments made by a suspended entity will be **put "on hold."**

        - [ ] Yes
        - [x] No
        > No. Although there is an investment, there is no mention of Nikolaj having a **commitment** from a designated entity at the time of his application. Under IRPR, s 98.10(2), “**a substitute evaluation must not be conducted for an applicant who did not have a commitment from a designated entity on the day on which they made their application.**”

    6. True or false: An immigration officer evaluating the application of Jano Murali thinks that she will become economically established in Canada despite not meeting all the requirements in subsection 98.01(2) of the IRPR.

        - [x] False
        > Although the officer can override the four criteria in subsection 98.01(2) if they conclude those criteria do not reflect the applicant’s actual ability to become economically established in Canada, the **officer needs the concurrence** of a second officer (IRPR, s 98.10(3)) to use this power.

        - [x] The details of any past collaboration between the angel investor and the applicant. That information may be relevant to the applicant
        - [ ] The details of any fees charged to the applicant. If any fee is charged to an applicant, the commitment is not valid.

    8. True or false: As long as a business incubator/angel investor/venture capital fund has the ability to assess the potential for and assist in the success of start-up business opportunities in Canada, and continue to meet these conditions, it can qualify as a designated entity.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        > Under subsection 98.03(2) of the IRPR, the entity must also be "recognized for its expertise in assessing the potential for and assisting in the success of start-up business opportunities in Canada."


    9. Sven Bjornsson is a citizen of Sweden. He has launched a federally incorporated business in Winnipeg. He is the sole director of the corporation and, along with his wife, owns 100% voting shares in the company. This company satisfies the requirement of a "qualifying business" and there is a commitment from a designated entity to support the business. As CEO, Sven earns $70,000/year.

        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        > The instructions state that if 1 of the syndicated entities is a designated venture capital fund, then the **venture capital fund must act as the lead**.

    11. True or false. An angel investor, business incubator or venture capital fund may be designated by the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship if they either are recognized for their expertise in assessing the potential for and assisting in the success of start-ups in Canada, or have the ability to assess the potential for and assist in the success of start-ups in Canada.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        > Designated entities must both be recognized and have the ability to assess the potential for and assist in the success of start-ups in Canada. The requirement is conjunctive, not disjunctive.

    12. A designated venture capital firms was found to have violated a provision of the Canada Business Corporations Act, under which it had been incorporated. Would this suspend the firm's ability to make commitments?
        - [x] Yes
        - [ ] No

    13. True or False: The Regulations allow for one foreign national per qualifying business to apply for the Start-Up Business Class.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        > Subsection **98.01(3)** of the IRPR makes clear that **up to 5** foreign nationals can apply as founders of the same business.

        - [x] Yes
        - [ ] No
