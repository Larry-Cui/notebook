## Engagement

To obtain a passing mark for Engagement, you must:

- complete the knowledge checks with a minimum of 80% on each
- attend the tutorial and plenary sessions (where applicable) or, in circumstances where attendance is not possible, submit the required 250-word written reflection within 7 days of the missed session
- make original contributions to the discussion forums
- complete all other Engagement activities identified with the Engagement banner (for example, legal skills activities and self-check exercises in onQ)
- submit a **Skills Reflection** that meets the rubric’s specified criteria

## Reflective Practice in ICL 840

Please submit your Skills Reflection using the [appropriate template](https://onq.queensu.ca/content/enforced/497280-GDipICLProgramPortal/Engagement/Skills_Reflections_Template.docx?isCourseFile=true&ou=497280){:target="\_blank"} to the assignment folder labeled "Engagement".

### Create your Skills Reflection

Begin by reviewing the Competency Inventory you completed at the beginning of the course. Also review the core Skills and Values listed at the top of this page. Refresh your memory of your engagement by reviewing the notes you made on Engagement.

Then, after this review, in 400 words (plus or minus 50 words), write a reflective narrative in two parts:

#### Part 1

Describe the changes you observe in your skill set, considering where you started from at the beginning of the course.

- Where did you see the most change in the nine Skills and Values from your initial self-assessment? Address one or two of the skills on the list of nine that you feel you made the most progress in during this course. Remember, it is not about immigration knowledge you gained, but about your growth in those one or two skills through your participation in the Engagement activities.
- What specific Engagement activities led to or fostered that change?
- What was it about your experience with those elements that created growth? (Keep in mind that failures as well as successes contribute to growth and the development of competency.)

#### Part 2

Identify those skills areas where growth did not occur or where further growth is necessary. Outline a concrete plan to initiate or advance further growth in those areas.

- What competencies are still developing for you? What skills are they related to?
- What did you observe that made you aware of your areas of weakness?
- Where did you hope to see change, but it didn’t materialize?
- What could you do differently? What is your plan for effective future growth in those areas?
- Think of questions 1 to 3 of Part 2 as necessary "pre-work" for question 4. You need to identify the skills you want to work on before you can plan how to address them. Question 4 is the ultimate focus of Part 2.

## Discussions

Most required discussion topics follow a similar routine. You will respond to the specific prompts and instructions with **200 words (+ or - 50) across at least two distinct posts**. Unless instructed otherwise, you may contribute your answers by starting "new threads" or by replying to the threads of others.

You must ensure that, over the course as a whole, **at least half your posts are replies**.
