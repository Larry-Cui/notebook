??? note "Introduction"

    - We will look at three different programs developed by the **provinces** or **in partnership between the federal government and the provinces**. These are the **British Columbia Provincial Nominee Program**, the **Quebec Skilled Worker program**, and **the Atlantic Immigration Program**.
    - For instance, from 2019 to 2024, the government piloted a specific immigration stream aimed at economic development in rural areas and the Canadian north, the '**Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot**'.

??? note "Shared Jurisdiction"

    - The Constitutional and Legislative Basis
        - subsection 91(25) of the ***Constitution Act***, 1867 provides the federal government with power to pass laws with respect to “naturalization and aliens.”
        - section 95 of the ***Constitution Act***, 1867 – one part of Canada’s constitution – provides authority to both the federal Parliament and the provinces to makes laws governing immigration, although federal laws are to prevail in case of conflict.
    - For instance, based on the success of the **Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot Program**, in 2024 IRCC launched [two subsequent pilots](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/rural-northern-immigration-pilot/community-interest.html){:target="\_blank"} - **the Rural Community Immigration pilot** and the **Francophone Community Immigration Pilot**.
    - IRPA s 8:
        - Subsection 8(1) establishes the authority to enter into agreements with the provinces or territories.
        - Subsection 8(2) then states that the IRPA and its regulations respecting the selection and sponsorship of, and the acquisition of status by, foreign nationals must be consistent with those agreements.
        - However, subsection 8(3) states that federal-provincial agreements cannot affect the IRPA’s provisions concerning **inadmissibility**.
    - IRPA s 9: Subsection 9(1) then further specifies that when a federal-provincial agreement gives sole responsibility to a province or territory for selecting foreign nationals who intend to reside in that province as permanent residents, then
        - the **province’s selection** of the foreign national for permanent residence shall be **determinative**, unless the foreign national is inadmissible or unless the agreement provides otherwise;
        - the province’s decision not to select the foreign national shall be determinative unless the agreement provides otherwise;
        - the foreign national shall not be granted permanent resident status contrary to any provincial law governing the number of new permanent residents who may settle in the province; and
        - **conditions imposed in accordance with the law of the province** have the same force and effect as if they were made under the IRPA.
        > As we shall see, however, the IRPR, does make it so that the **province’s decision is not entirely determinative.**
    - IRPA s 10:
        - Finally, section 10 sets out a mandate for the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship to **consult** with the provinces.
        - Subsection 10(1) states the Minister may consult with provinces on immigration and refugee protection programs to facilitate cooperation.
        - Subsection 10(2) states that the Minister must consult with the provinces with respect to the number of foreign nationals in each class (refugee, economic, and family) who will become permanent residents each year, their distribution in Canada, and integration measures.

??? note "Provincial Nominee Class Regulations"

    - The federal government has entered into agreements over immigration with every province and territory **other than Nunavut**.
    - The regulations for the Provincial Nominee Class are set out in **section 87** in the IRPR. Section 87 can be understood as comprising three parts:
        - The three basic **requirements** for inclusion in the Provincial Nominee Class.
        - A power of **substituted evaluation**.
        - Certain **exclusions** for persons whose admission would be based on the provision of capital or participation in “an immigration-linked investment scheme.”
    - Basic Requirements
        - Subsection 87(1) establishes the Provincial Nominee Class as a class of persons who may become permanent residents on the basis of their ability to become **economically established** in Canada.
        - Subsection 87(2) then sets out that a foreign national is a member of the Provincial Nominee Class if:
            - they are named in a **nomination** certificate issued by a province or territory under an agreement with the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, and
            - they intend to **reside** in the province or territory that has nominated them.
    - If a foreign national – when being examined either at a port of entry or in Canada – indicates they never intended, or no longer intend, to reside in the nominating province or territory, they may be denied permanent resident status. In such cases, they may also face a determination that they are inadmissible under **section 41** of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), which sets out the ground of inadmissibility for non-compliance.
    - The provincial or territorial **nomination is generally supposed to satisfy the requirement of likely economic establishment**.
    - Substituted Evaluation in the PNC: Subsections 87(3) and (4) of the IRPR provide immigration officers with the discretion to substitute their evaluation, with the **concurrence of a second officer**, of whether or not a nominee is likely to become economically established in Canada.
    - The [operational instructions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/provincial-nominees/determining-membership-class.html){:target="\_blank"} provide extensive guidance to officers on how to evaluate the ability of a provincial nominee to become economically established when considering the **exercise of their power of substituted evaluation** under subsections 87(3) and (4) pf the IRPR.
    - *Sarfraz v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2019 FC 1578](https://canlii.ca/t/j3wnn){:target="\_blank"}.
        - In that decision, an officer exercised their **substituted evaluation** power to refuse an application made under the Saskatchewan Immigration Nominee Program because of concerns regarding the applicant’s language ability.
        - Justice Fuhrer wrote at para 22: the substituted evaluation power ... leaves open that officers at the federal level are entitled to their own interpretation on a file, and may consider additional or altogether different factors [than the nominating province or territory] when determining whether to substitute an evaluation pursuant to IRPR 87(3) … While a provincial or territorial **nomination decision** is owed deference on the government’s assessment of the applicable criteria, it is **not binding on federal officers**.
        - Justice Fuhrer found the officer erred in three ways:
            - By **relying on the Employment and Social Development Canada Job Bank** in evaluating whether the applicant could become economically established in Canada, to the exclusion of the factors taken into account by the nominating province.
            - Failing to hold a **follow-up discussion** with the provincial authorities, even though they requested one.
            - Failing to consider whether the applicant’s **spouse could contribute** to the family’s economic establishment.
    - Exclusions: Subsections 87(5) to (11) of the IRPR govern certain exclusions from the Provincial Nominee Class.

??? note "Applications under the Provincial Nominee Class"

    - There are two streams. Applications for the Provincial Nominee Class may be made through the **Express Entry system** or through the **non-express entry application process**, where applications are submitted via the permanent residence portal.
    - If an applicant does not apply through Express Entry, because they have been nominated by a province in a program that is not Express Entry eligible, they apply through a new **Permanent residence online application portal for clients** and a **Permanent Residence Portal for representatives** to submit applications with their clients.
    - Once an applicant has received an invitation and submitted their application electronically through the Express Entry system, their application will be **assessed for**:
        - Whether they meet the requirements under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, or IRPR, for the **provincial nominee** class;
        - Whether they are **inadmissible**;
        - Whether they meet the program **requirements** for either the Federal Skilled Worker Class, the Federal Skilled Trades Class, or the Canadian Experience Class;
        - Whether they meet the requirements of **section 11.2** (met at ITA and Submission) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).

??? note "The Atlantic Immigration Program (AIP)"

    - IRCC started accepting permanent residence applications under the [Atlantic Immigration Program (AIP)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/atlantic-immigration-program/assessing-application.html){:target="\_blank"} on March 6, 2022.
    - three programs created through Ministerial Instructions under section 14.1 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act in 2017:
        - The Atlantic Canada **Intermediate Skilled Worker** Class
        - The Atlantic Canada **Highly Skilled Worker** Class
        - The Atlantic Canada **International Graduate** Class
    - Instructions issued under section **14.1 (3)** of the IRPA **cap** the number of applications accepted under the program each year at **2,750**, distributed unequally among the Atlantic provinces: 646 for New Brunswick; 792 for Nova Scotia; 442 for Newfoundland and Labrador; and 120 for Prince Edward Island.
    - Since March 6 2022, the three programs are now part of the Regulations under part 6 - economic immigration under section **87.3 of the IRPR**.
    - The "three streams" concept is **gone**, and now the key requirement for candidates is to have sufficient skilled work experience (NOC TEERs 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4), which is **not** required when the candidate has recently studied and graduated as an **international student** at a recognized post-secondary institution.
    - Now as a program, the **number** of permanent residents accepted through AIP is established yearly with the immigration levels reporting before Parliament, as with all of the other Federal Immigration programs.
    - The AIP is an **employer-focused** program.  Employers must apply to the province of location to be designated as participants, and once designated, then bring each job opportunity to the province to be endorsed (so, **no LMIA**).  Once the job opportunity is **endorsed**, then the employer can **find** an acceptable candidate, **offer** them the job, and they can **apply** to IRCC for permanent residence.
    - To be designated as a participant, the employer must apply to the province establishing that they:
        - Have a business operating in good standing
        - Provide information on labour needs
        - Commit to working with a service provider organization on settlement and retention
    - Then to go to the next step and have a position endorsed, the employer must:
        - Demonstrate that efforts to hire locally have been unsuccessful
        - Recruit a foreign worker
        - Provide a valid, full-time, non-seasonal job offer co-signed by the foreign worker
        - Provide an individualized settlement plan co-signed by the foreign worker
        - Complete mandatory onboarding training and, if required, intercultural competency training
    - Some of these requirements are set out in **IRPR 87.3**, some in the IRCC Program Delivery **Instructions**, some in the provinces’ immigration **agreements** with the federal government, and some are found in the guides on the provincial governments’ **websites**.
    - If a foreign national is **endorsed** by the province (in our case, Nova Scotia), they will receive a Certificate of Endorsement from the province and an endorsement number. They must then **apply** to IRCC for permanent residence before the expiry date of the endorsement. Candidates may also **apply** for a temporary work permit so that they can work while their application for permanent residence is being processed.
    - When applying for permanent residence from IRCC, additional requirements are set out in the regulations under **87.3**.
        - **Work experience:** In the last 5 years, candidates must have at least one year (1560 hours) of work experience in a NOC TEER category 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4
            - International graduates are exempt from the work experience requirement if they completed a post-secondary program in Atlantic Canada of at least **two years** and resided in the Province for at least **16 months** in the two years before graduating.
        - **Education requirement:** Candidates with a job offer in NOC TEER category 0 or 1 must demonstrate completion of a post secondary credential of at least one year and candidates with a job offer in NOC TEER category 2, 3, 4 must demonstrate completion of high school.
        - Language requirement: Candidates must provide language test results demonstrating a minimum **CLB 5** for positions in TEER category 0, 1, 2 or 3 and **CLB 4** for TEER category 4.
        - Settlement funds: Candidates must demonstrate they have funding to support themselves when they initially arrive in Canada. The AIP requires **12.5% of the LICO**. This requirement does **not** apply if candidates are already living and working in Canada with a valid work permit.
        - Finally, applicants must have an **offer** of employment from a designated employer for a full-time, non-seasonal position.
            - That is for at least **one year** after the time the applicant will become a permanent resident for occupations that are in NOC TEER category 0, 1, 2 or 3 and **permanent** (no end date) for NOC TEER category 4.
            - That is at the **same** skill level or **higher** than the work experience that qualified you for the job.
            - The job offer cannot be from a company where the applicant or their spouse is a **majority owner**.

??? note "AIP - Nova Scotia"

    - To apply for PR under the Atlantic Program, a foreign national must have received an offer of employment meeting criteria of **S. 87.3 (6)(c)**:
        - (c) it must be made by the employer named in the **endorsement certificate**, and that employer must not be referred to in any of subparagraphs **200(3)(h)(i) to (iii)** or more than **50% owned or controlled**, directly or indirectly, by the foreign national or their spouse or common-law partner;
    - Subparagraphs 200(3)(h)(i) to (iii) refer employers who have failed to comply with the rules of the work permit regime. That is, it covers employers who have failed to provide wages and working conditions in conformity with job offers that were the basis of previous work permits or having failed to pay an administrative monetary penalty.
    - Designated Employers:
        - has been in continuous, active operation for **two years** in the Atlantic region or has approved corporate plans to relocate to Nova Scotia;
        - have been under the **same management** for at least the 2 years prior to designation
        - agrees to complete an **intercultural competency assessment** and complete any required **training**, with an approved immigrant **settlement** service organization
        - agrees to settlement supports, and services
        - report to the province for up to 3 years from the start of their employment
    - to receive an endorsement an employer must establish:
        - That the job offer is **genuine**, and
        - That they have agreed to a **settlement plan** with the prospective employee based on a pre-endorsement needs assessment.
    - To apply for an endorsement in Nova Scotia, an applicant and the employer must fill out the Endorsement Application through **Nova Scotia’s online system**. The complete list can be found in the [Endorsement Application Guidelines](https://novascotiaimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/AIP-Endorsement-Guidelines-EN.pdf){:target="\_blank"}.

??? note "British Columbia Provincial Nominee Program"

    - The pieces of BCPNP framework include:
        - The Canada-British Columbia Immigration **Agreement** from [2021](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/agreements/federal-provincial-territorial/british-columbia/canada-british-columbia-immigration-agreement-2021.html){:target="\_blank"},
        - The Provincial Immigration Programs **Act** [(BCPIPA)](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/complete/statreg/15037){:target="\_blank"},
        - The Provincial Immigration Programs **Regulation** [(BCPIPR)](https://www.bclaws.gov.bc.ca/civix/document/id/lc/statreg/20_2017){:target="\_blank"}, and
        - The Program [**Guide**](https://www.welcomebc.ca/immigrate-to-b-c/bc-pnp-si-program-guide-pdf){:target="\_blank"}, Technical Guide and Post-Nomination Guide for the BC PNP.
    - Section 4 of Annex A provides the most detailed list of requirements for the BC PNP:
        - It goes on to state that BC will accordingly establish “objective and transparent criteria” for nomination that will "be designed to assess the ability of the applicant to become **economically established** in British Columbia and to demonstrate the economic benefit to the province ” (see section 4.3).
        - The kinds of **factors** that may be used to determine likelihood of economic establishment are also set out in section 4.5: “**current job or job offer, language ability, work experience, education and training, and business ownership skills and past experience.**”
        - Section 4.6 states that **non-economic factors** may only be used to determine “the applicant's ability to adapt, likelihood to **reside and/or settle** in the nominating province.”
        - CLB 4 for NOC C, D (NOC 4, 5)
    - the government of British Columbia has also established its own system for issuing invitations to apply based on a **points system** administered through its online registration system.
    - **BCPIPA**
        - Subsection 2(1) of the BCPIPA provides the Minister of Jobs, Economic Development and Competitiveness with the power to designate a **Director of Provincial Immigration Programs**, as head of the BC PNP
        - Subsection 3(2) of the BCPIPA gives the director the power to invite applications for a class of approvals specified. This power provides the mandate for BC’s own **invitation-to-apply** system, based on points allocated when applicants register online.
        - subsection 3(3) of the BCPIPA: Refusal to Accept for Processing
            - if an invitation to apply has been issued that does not apply to an applicant;
            - if the applicant has retained an unauthorized representative;
            - if the applicant has previously had an approval cancelled; or
            - if a prescribed requirement has not been met.
        - The “**prescribed requirements**” are set out in section 5 of the BCPIPR, for example, misrepresentation within 2 years.
        - subsection **4(1)** of the BCPIPA states that the director may approve or decline an application (i.e., an application that the director has not refused to accept) after taking into account **prescribed matters**, which are found in section 6 of the BCPIPR:
            - whether the applicant’s entry will be of **benefit** to the economic development of British Columbia;
            - the applicant’s ability and intention to permanently **settle** and become **economically established** in British Columbia;
            - the applicant’s **language** skills;
            - whether the applicant’s entry will adversely affect the settlement of a labour **dispute** or the employment of a person involved in a labour dispute, or employment or training opportunities for British Columbians;
            - whether the applicant has entered into or intends to enter into an **immigration-linked investment** scheme;
            - whether the information provided in relation to the application is **accurate**, complete and reliable;
            - with respect to an application for a **business** approval, whether the applicant will provide active and ongoing management of the eligible business from within British Columbia.
        - Subsection **4(2)** of the BCPIPA allows the director to make an approval of a nominee subject to **conditions considered “necessary and advisable”**. Section 5 of the BCPIPA imposes an obligation on “an approved person” (i.e., a nominee) to comply with any such conditions and also to advise the director of any material change in their circumstances. Failure to report a material change or failure to comply with a condition may lead to the cancellation of an approval, under subsection **6(1)** of the BCPIPA.
        - Approvals can also be cancelled if the director is satisfied that the nominee provided **false or misleading** information in their application.
        - Section 7 of the BCPIPA states that if the director has declined an application for a nomination, the applicant may **request a review** of that decision within 30 days if the applicant is in Canada or within 60 days if they are outside Canada.
            - The Program Guide (at page 74) states the following regarding reviews: A review is not a chance to submit new evidence or re-argue the evidence submitted in your application. The applicant is responsible for establishing that the process was **unfair** or that the decision was **unreasonable** in relation to the evidence and program criteria.
        - There are currently five streams in the BC PNP Skills Immigration program, four of which can be applied for through Express Entry.
            - Skilled worker,
            - Healthcare professional,
            - International graduate,
            - International post-graduate, and
            - Entry-level and semi-skilled (no EE available).
        - The International Graduate and International Post-Graduate streams are currently **closed**. In March 2024, BC announced that in early 2025 these streams will be replaced by three new streams: **Bachelor's stream, Master's stream, and Doctorate stream**.
        - General Requirements:
            - have a qualifying job offer. For skilled workers, a job offer must be for an occupation classified as TEER Category 0, 1, 2 or 3 under the NOC matrix.
            - The requirements for employers to be “eligible” are set out in pages 50 to 54 of the Program Guide.They include, for example and among others, the requirements:
                - to be “in **good standing**” in BC (e.g., to be incorporated);
                - to have a certain number of full-time, indeterminate **employees** (at least 5, if located in the Greater Vancouver area or at least 3 if elsewhere in BC); and
                - to show that genuine **efforts** were made to recruit from the local labour market before extending a job offer to the applicant.
            - The Program Guide contains detailed information on how to meet these requirements in Part 4: Employer Requirements. Much of the necessary information to verify these requirements are collected through the BC PNP **Job Offer Form**, but **supporting documents** will be required as well.
        - Qualified Employment:
            - Qualification may be assessed referring to the **NOC** matrix, WorkBC (a provincial agency that provides labour market information), or industry standards.
            - The **wage** offered must be competitive with B.C. wage rates for the occupation and the employment must provide an economic benefit to the province.
            - The employment offered must not adversely affect the settlement of a **labour dispute**.
        - Language Proficiency:
            - CLB 4 for NOC 2, 3, 4 or 5
            - Applicants are not required to submit language test results if position the position they have accepted is classified as TEER category 0 or 1
            - Copies of language test results must be provided at the time of application.
        - Minimum Income Requirements:
            - In addition, the BC PNP imposes **minimum income requirements**, as opposed to the requirement of settlement funds imposed (as we have seen) under certain federal economic classes.
            - A table showing the minimum income required, by location and number of dependents, is found at page 22 of the Program Guide.
        - Program Integrity Requirements:
            - Applicants will not be nominated if they are **prohibited** from entering Canada, are in Canada but **out of status**, are working in Canada **without authorization**, have an unresolved **refugee** protection claim, or are under a **removal order**.
            - For the purposes of assessing work experience in Canada, the BC PNP will only consider authorized work experience.
            - In the **five years preceding** the application, and throughout the BC PNP application process, the applicant and their spouse or common-law partner must not have held a combined ownership/equity stake of **more than 10 per cent** in the BC company that has offered the applicant employment.
        - Specific Requirements: Skilled Worker Stream
            - an offer of employment must be classified as TEER category **0, 1, 2, or 3** under the NOC matrix.
            - The applicant must also have a “**minimum two years** of directly related full-time (or full-time equivalent) work experience in the skilled occupation that has been offered to you, and, if applicable, the credentials and qualification requirements of the position.”
            - The work experience may be in Canada or abroad. “Directly related” work experience is defined as experience classified under the **same NOC code** as the position the applicant will be taking. This is not a hard and fast rule, as the program guide states: “Experience in a related occupation at a NOC level equal to or greater than the NOC code of the B.C. job offer may also be included if, at the time of application, you can satisfactorily demonstrate how this work experience is directly related.”
        - Proof of Eligibility: To apply through Express Entry BC, applicants must provide an **Express Entry Profile Number** and **Job Seeker Number**, indicating that they meet the eligibility requirements for the Federal Skilled Worker Class, the Canadian Experience Class, or the Federal Skilled Trades Class.
        - Process:
            - Those wishing to apply for a nomination from BC as a skilled worker must do so through **BC PNP’s online registrations system** at BC PNP Online.
            - After having completed the registration, the applicant receives a registration score and will be placed in a **selection pool**. It remains in the selection pool for up to 12 months.
            - Skilled workers can only apply if they receive an **invitation** to apply. Invitations are issued by BC PNP periodically, setting out minimum required scores for each program and sometimes excluding some occupational codes.
            - Once an applicant is invited to apply, they have **30 days** to submit their application online and pay the $1,475 fee.
        - Activity: Issue Spotting on Job Offer Form
            - To hire a foreign national to come to BC as a skilled worker, an employer must demonstrate genuine and bona fide efforts were made to **recruit** from the local labour market, and that hiring the foreign national will not adversely affect employment or development opportunities for Canadian citizens and/or permanent residents.One way to meet this requirement is to first make efforts to recruit locally before making an offer to a foreign national.
            - Please examine the attached [job offer form](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1uLaP9J5PVQDc4EXSEPDSB1X7MxihThqN/view?usp=sharing){:target="\_blank"}, including the supporting print-out of the [job posting](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FcAQ7YijFGkq_T9rZiLkFglKRBFe7APF/view?usp=sharing){:target="\_blank"} from the Canada Job Bank.
            - There are at least two problems with the job offer form.
                - (1) The job was not advertised for long enough. On page 52 of the Program Guide, it states that “For NOC Skill Type 0 or NOC Skill Level A occupations (based on the National Occupational Classification), recruitment advertisement must be for at least **14 days**.”  Here the advertisement was for 1 week, or 7 days. Therefore, I would advise the client that the employer must advertise the position for longer before making the offer if they want the candidate to be nominated.
                - (2) Further, the **salary** offer is outside the pay range posted in the job offer. That suggests that Mr. Hidalgo-Muniz is being underpaid. I would advise the client that the salary offered must be $23/hour or higher.
