??? note "Introduction"

    - We will look at three different programs developed by the **provinces** or **in partnership between the federal government and the provinces**. These are the **British Columbia Provincial Nominee Program**, the **Quebec Skilled Worker program**, and **the Atlantic Immigration Program**.
    - For instance, from 2019 to 2024, the government piloted a specific immigration stream aimed at economic development in rural areas and the Canadian north, the '**Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot**'.

??? note "Shared Jurisdiction"

    - The Constitutional and Legislative Basis
        - subsection 91(25) of the ***Constitution Act***, 1867 provides the federal government with power to pass laws with respect to “naturalization and aliens.”
        - section 95 of the ***Constitution Act***, 1867 – one part of Canada’s constitution – provides authority to both the federal Parliament and the provinces to makes laws governing immigration, although federal laws are to prevail in case of conflict.
    - For instance, based on the success of the **Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot Program**, in 2024 IRCC launched [two subsequent pilots](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/rural-northern-immigration-pilot/community-interest.html){:target="\_blank"} - **the Rural Community Immigration pilot** and the **Francophone Community Immigration Pilot**.
    - IRPA s 8:
        - Subsection 8(1) establishes the authority to enter into agreements with the provinces or territories.
        - Subsection 8(2) then states that the IRPA and its regulations respecting the selection and sponsorship of, and the acquisition of status by, foreign nationals must be consistent with those agreements.
        - However, subsection 8(3) states that federal-provincial agreements cannot affect the IRPA’s provisions concerning **inadmissibility**.
    - IRPA s 9: Subsection 9(1) then further specifies that when a federal-provincial agreement gives sole responsibility to a province or territory for selecting foreign nationals who intend to reside in that province as permanent residents, then
        - the **province’s selection** of the foreign national for permanent residence shall be **determinative**, unless the foreign national is inadmissible or unless the agreement provides otherwise;
        - the province’s decision not to select the foreign national shall be determinative unless the agreement provides otherwise;
        - the foreign national shall not be granted permanent resident status contrary to any provincial law governing the number of new permanent residents who may settle in the province; and
        - **conditions imposed in accordance with the law of the province** have the same force and effect as if they were made under the IRPA.
        > As we shall see, however, the IRPR, does make it so that the **province’s decision is not entirely determinative.**
    - IRPA s 10:
        - Finally, section 10 sets out a mandate for the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship to **consult** with the provinces.
        - Subsection 10(1) states the Minister may consult with provinces on immigration and refugee protection programs to facilitate cooperation.
        - Subsection 10(2) states that the Minister must consult with the provinces with respect to the number of foreign nationals in each class (refugee, economic, and family) who will become permanent residents each year, their distribution in Canada, and integration measures.

??? note "Provincial Nominee Class Regulations"

    - The federal government has entered into agreements over immigration with every province and territory **other than Nunavut**.
    - The regulations for the Provincial Nominee Class are set out in **section 87** in the IRPR. Section 87 can be understood as comprising three parts:
        - The three basic **requirements** for inclusion in the Provincial Nominee Class.
        - A power of **substituted evaluation**.
        - Certain **exclusions** for persons whose admission would be based on the provision of capital or participation in “an immigration-linked investment scheme.”
    - Basic Requirements
        - Subsection 87(1) establishes the Provincial Nominee Class as a class of persons who may become permanent residents on the basis of their ability to become **economically established** in Canada.
        - Subsection 87(2) then sets out that a foreign national is a member of the Provincial Nominee Class if:
            - they are named in a **nomination** certificate issued by a province or territory under an agreement with the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, and
            - they intend to **reside** in the province or territory that has nominated them.
    - If a foreign national – when being examined either at a port of entry or in Canada – indicates they never intended, or no longer intend, to reside in the nominating province or territory, they may be denied permanent resident status. In such cases, they may also face a determination that they are inadmissible under **section 41** of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), which sets out the ground of inadmissibility for non-compliance.
    - The provincial or territorial **nomination is generally supposed to satisfy the requirement of likely economic establishment**.
    - Substituted Evaluation in the PNC: Subsections 87(3) and (4) of the IRPR provide immigration officers with the discretion to substitute their evaluation, with the **concurrence of a second officer**, of whether or not a nominee is likely to become economically established in Canada.
    - The [operational instructions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/provincial-nominees/determining-membership-class.html){:target="\_blank"} provide extensive guidance to officers on how to evaluate the ability of a provincial nominee to become economically established when considering the **exercise of their power of substituted evaluation** under subsections 87(3) and (4) pf the IRPR.
    - *Sarfraz v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2019 FC 1578](https://canlii.ca/t/j3wnn){:target="\_blank"}.
        - In that decision, an officer exercised their **substituted evaluation** power to refuse an application made under the Saskatchewan Immigration Nominee Program because of concerns regarding the applicant’s language ability.
        - Justice Fuhrer wrote at para 22: the substituted evaluation power ... leaves open that officers at the federal level are entitled to their own interpretation on a file, and may consider additional or altogether different factors [than the nominating province or territory] when determining whether to substitute an evaluation pursuant to IRPR 87(3) … While a provincial or territorial **nomination decision** is owed deference on the government’s assessment of the applicable criteria, it is **not binding on federal officers**.
        - Justice Fuhrer found the officer erred in three ways:
            - By **relying on the Employment and Social Development Canada Job Bank** in evaluating whether the applicant could become economically established in Canada, to the exclusion of the factors taken into account by the nominating province.
            - Failing to hold a **follow-up discussion** with the provincial authorities, even though they requested one.
            - Failing to consider whether the applicant’s **spouse could contribute** to the family’s economic establishment.
    - Exclusions: Subsections 87(5) to (11) of the IRPR govern certain exclusions from the Provincial Nominee Class.

???+ note "Applications under the Provincial Nominee Class"

    - There are two streams. Applications for the Provincial Nominee Class may be made through the **Express Entry system** or through the **non-express entry application process**, where applications are submitted via the permanent residence portal.
    - If an applicant does not apply through Express Entry, because they have been nominated by a province in a program that is not Express Entry eligible, they apply through a new **Permanent residence online application portal for clients** and a **Permanent Residence Portal for representatives** to submit applications with their clients.
    - Once an applicant has received an invitation and submitted their application electronically through the Express Entry system, their application will be **assessed for**:
        - Whether they meet the requirements under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, or IRPR, for the provincial **nominee** class;
        - Whether they are **inadmissible**;
        - Whether they meet the program **requirements** for either the Federal Skilled Worker Class, the Federal Skilled Trades Class, or the Canadian Experience Class;
        - Whether they meet the requirements of **section 11.2** (met at ITA and Submission) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).
