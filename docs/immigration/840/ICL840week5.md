??? note "Introduction"

    - We will look at three different programs developed by the **provinces** or **in partnership between the federal government and the provinces**. These are the **British Columbia Provincial Nominee Program**, the **Quebec Skilled Worker program**, and **the Atlantic Immigration Program**.
    - For instance, from 2019 to 2024, the government piloted a specific immigration stream aimed at economic development in rural areas and the Canadian north, the '**Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot**'.

??? note "Shared Jurisdiction"

    - The Constitutional and Legislative Basis
        - subsection 91(25) of the ***Constitution Act***, 1867 provides the federal government with power to pass laws with respect to “naturalization and aliens.”
        - section 95 of the ***Constitution Act***, 1867 – one part of Canada’s constitution – provides authority to both the federal Parliament and the provinces to makes laws governing immigration, although federal laws are to prevail in case of conflict.
    - For instance, based on the success of the **Rural and Northern Immigration Pilot Program**, in 2024 IRCC launched [two subsequent pilots](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/rural-northern-immigration-pilot/community-interest.html){:target="\_blank"} - **the Rural Community Immigration pilot** and the **Francophone Community Immigration Pilot**.
    - IRPA s 8:
        - Subsection 8(1) establishes the authority to enter into agreements with the provinces or territories.
        - Subsection 8(2) then states that the IRPA and its regulations respecting the selection and sponsorship of, and the acquisition of status by, foreign nationals must be consistent with those agreements.
        - However, subsection 8(3) states that federal-provincial agreements cannot affect the IRPA’s provisions concerning **inadmissibility**.
    - IRPA s 9: Subsection 9(1) then further specifies that when a federal-provincial agreement gives sole responsibility to a province or territory for selecting foreign nationals who intend to reside in that province as permanent residents, then
        - the **province’s selection** of the foreign national for permanent residence shall be **determinative**, unless the foreign national is inadmissible or unless the agreement provides otherwise;
        - the province’s decision not to select the foreign national shall be determinative unless the agreement provides otherwise;
        - the foreign national shall not be granted permanent resident status contrary to any provincial law governing the number of new permanent residents who may settle in the province; and
        - **conditions imposed in accordance with the law of the province** have the same force and effect as if they were made under the IRPA.
        > As we shall see, however, the IRPR, does make it so that the **province’s decision is not entirely determinative.**
    - IRPA s 10:
        - Finally, section 10 sets out a mandate for the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship to **consult** with the provinces.
        - Subsection 10(1) states the Minister may consult with provinces on immigration and refugee protection programs to facilitate cooperation.
        - Subsection 10(2) states that the Minister must consult with the provinces with respect to the number of foreign nationals in each class (refugee, economic, and family) who will become permanent residents each year, their distribution in Canada, and integration measures.

??? note "Provincial Nominee Class Regulations"

    - The federal government has entered into agreements over immigration with every province and territory **other than Nunavut**.
    - The regulations for the Provincial Nominee Class are set out in **section 87** in the IRPR. Section 87 can be understood as comprising three parts:
        - The three basic **requirements** for inclusion in the Provincial Nominee Class.
        - A power of **substituted evaluation**.
        - Certain **exclusions** for persons whose admission would be based on the provision of capital or participation in “an immigration-linked investment scheme.”
    - Basic Requirements
        - Subsection 87(1) establishes the Provincial Nominee Class as a class of persons who may become permanent residents on the basis of their ability to become **economically established** in Canada.
        - Subsection 87(2) then sets out that a foreign national is a member of the Provincial Nominee Class if:
            - they are named in a **nomination** certificate issued by a province or territory under an agreement with the Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, and
            - they intend to **reside** in the province or territory that has nominated them.
    - If a foreign national – when being examined either at a port of entry or in Canada – indicates they never intended, or no longer intend, to reside in the nominating province or territory, they may be denied permanent resident status. In such cases, they may also face a determination that they are inadmissible under **section 41** of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), which sets out the ground of inadmissibility for non-compliance.
    - The provincial or territorial **nomination is generally supposed to satisfy the requirement of likely economic establishment**.
    - Substituted Evaluation in the PNC: Subsections 87(3) and (4) of the IRPR provide immigration officers with the discretion to substitute their evaluation, with the **concurrence of a second officer**, of whether or not a nominee is likely to become economically established in Canada.
    - The [operational instructions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/provincial-nominees/determining-membership-class.html){:target="\_blank"} provide extensive guidance to officers on how to evaluate the ability of a provincial nominee to become economically established when considering the **exercise of their power of substituted evaluation** under subsections 87(3) and (4) pf the IRPR.
    - *Sarfraz v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2019 FC 1578](https://canlii.ca/t/j3wnn){:target="\_blank"}.
        - In that decision, an officer exercised their **substituted evaluation** power to refuse an application made under the Saskatchewan Immigration Nominee Program because of concerns regarding the applicant’s language ability.
        - Justice Fuhrer wrote at para 22: the substituted evaluation power ... leaves open that officers at the federal level are entitled to their own interpretation on a file, and may consider additional or altogether different factors [than the nominating province or territory] when determining whether to substitute an evaluation pursuant to IRPR 87(3) … While a provincial or territorial **nomination decision** is owed deference on the government’s assessment of the applicable criteria, it is **not binding on federal officers**.
        - Justice Fuhrer found the officer erred in three ways:
            - By **relying on the Employment and Social Development Canada Job Bank** in evaluating whether the applicant could become economically established in Canada, to the exclusion of the factors taken into account by the nominating province.
            - Failing to hold a **follow-up discussion** with the provincial authorities, even though they requested one.
            - Failing to consider whether the applicant’s **spouse could contribute** to the family’s economic establishment.
    - Exclusions: Subsections 87(5) to (11) of the IRPR govern certain exclusions from the Provincial Nominee Class.

??? note "Applications under the Provincial Nominee Class"

    - There are two streams. Applications for the Provincial Nominee Class may be made through the **Express Entry system** or through the **non-express entry application process**, where applications are submitted via the permanent residence portal.
    - If an applicant does not apply through Express Entry, because they have been nominated by a province in a program that is not Express Entry eligible, they apply through a new **Permanent residence online application portal for clients** and a **Permanent Residence Portal for representatives** to submit applications with their clients.
    - Once an applicant has received an invitation and submitted their application electronically through the Express Entry system, their application will be **assessed for**:
        - Whether they meet the requirements under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, or IRPR, for the provincial **nominee** class;
        - Whether they are **inadmissible**;
        - Whether they meet the program **requirements** for either the Federal Skilled Worker Class, the Federal Skilled Trades Class, or the Canadian Experience Class;
        - Whether they meet the requirements of **section 11.2** (met at ITA and Submission) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).

??? note "The Atlantic Immigration Program (AIP)"

    - IRCC started accepting permanent residence applications under the [Atlantic Immigration Program (AIP)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/atlantic-immigration-program/assessing-application.html){:target="\_blank"} on March 6, 2022.
    - three programs created through Ministerial Instructions under section 14.1 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act in 2017:
        - The Atlantic Canada **Intermediate Skilled Worker** Class
        - The Atlantic Canada **Highly Skilled Worker** Class
        - The Atlantic Canada **International Graduate** Class
    - Instructions issued under section **14.1 (3)** of the IRPA **cap** the number of applications accepted under the program each year at **2,750**, distributed unequally among the Atlantic provinces: 646 for New Brunswick; 792 for Nova Scotia; 442 for Newfoundland and Labrador; and 120 for Prince Edward Island.
    - Since March 6 2022, the three programs are now part of the Regulations under part 6 - economic immigration under section **87.3 of the IRPR**.
    - The "three streams" concept is **gone**, and now the key requirement for candidates is to have sufficient skilled work experience (NOC TEERs 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4), which is **not** required when the candidate has recently studied and graduated as an **international student** at a recognized post-secondary institution.
    - Now as a program, the **number** of permanent residents accepted through AIP is established yearly with the immigration levels reporting before Parliament, as with all of the other Federal Immigration programs.
    - The AIP is an **employer-focused** program.  Employers must apply to the province of location to be designated as participants, and once designated, then bring each job opportunity to the province to be endorsed (so, **no LMIA**).  Once the job opportunity is **endorsed**, then the employer can **find** an acceptable candidate, **offer** them the job, and they can **apply** to IRCC for permanent residence.
    - To be designated as a participant, the employer must apply to the province establishing that they:
        - Have a business operating in good standing
        - Provide information on labour needs
        - Commit to working with a service provider organization on settlement and retention
    - Then to go to the next step and have a position endorsed, the employer must:
        - Demonstrate that efforts to hire locally have been unsuccessful
        - Recruit a foreign worker
        - Provide a valid, full-time, non-seasonal job offer co-signed by the foreign worker
        - Provide an individualized settlement plan co-signed by the foreign worker
        - Complete mandatory onboarding training and, if required, intercultural competency training
    - Some of these requirements are set out in **IRPR 87.3**, some in the IRCC Program Delivery **Instructions**, some in the provinces’ immigration **agreements** with the federal government, and some are found in the guides on the provincial governments’ **websites**.
    - If a foreign national is **endorsed** by the province (in our case, Nova Scotia), they will receive a Certificate of Endorsement from the province and an endorsement number. They must then **apply** to IRCC for permanent residence before the expiry date of the endorsement. Candidates may also **apply** for a temporary work permit so that they can work while their application for permanent residence is being processed.
    - When applying for permanent residence from IRCC, additional requirements are set out in the regulations under **87.3**.
        - **Work experience:** In the last 5 years, candidates must have at least one year (1560 hours) of work experience in a NOC TEER category 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4
            - International graduates are exempt from the work experience requirement if they completed a post-secondary program in Atlantic Canada of at least **two years** and resided in the Province for at least **16 months** in the two years before graduating.
        - **Education requirement:** Candidates with a job offer in NOC TEER category 0 or 1 must demonstrate completion of a post secondary credential of at least one year and candidates with a job offer in NOC TEER category 2, 3, 4 must demonstrate completion of high school.
        - Language requirement: Candidates must provide language test results demonstrating a minimum **CLB 5** for positions in TEER category 0, 1, 2 or 3 and **CLB 4** for TEER category 4.
        - Settlement funds: Candidates must demonstrate they have funding to support themselves when they initially arrive in Canada. The AIP requires **12.5% of the LICO**. This requirement does **not** apply if candidates are already living and working in Canada with a valid work permit.
        - Finally, applicants must have an **offer** of employment from a designated employer for a full-time, non-seasonal position.
            - That is for at least **one year** after the time the applicant will become a permanent resident for occupations that are in NOC TEER category 0, 1, 2 or 3 and **permanent** (no end date) for NOC TEER category 4.
            - That is at the **same** skill level or **higher** than the work experience that qualified you for the job.
            - The job offer cannot be from a company where the applicant or their spouse is a **majority owner**.

??? note "AIP - Nova Scotia"

    - To apply for PR under the Atlantic Program, a foreign national must have received an offer of employment meeting criteria of **S. 87.3 (6)(c)**:
        - (c) it must be made by the employer named in the **endorsement certificate**, and that employer must not be referred to in any of subparagraphs **200(3)(h)(i) to (iii)** or more than **50% owned or controlled**, directly or indirectly, by the foreign national or their spouse or common-law partner;
    - Subparagraphs 200(3)(h)(i) to (iii) refer employers who have failed to comply with the rules of the work permit regime. That is, it covers employers who have failed to provide wages and working conditions in conformity with job offers that were the basis of previous work permits or having failed to pay an administrative monetary penalty.
    - Designated Employers:
        - has been in continuous, active operation for **two years** in the Atlantic region or has approved corporate plans to relocate to Nova Scotia;
        - have been under the **same management** for at least the 2 years prior to designation
        - agrees to complete an **intercultural competency assessment** and complete any required **training**, with an approved immigrant **settlement** service organization
        - agrees to settlement supports, and services
        - report to the province for up to 3 years from the start of their employment
    - to receive an endorsement an employer must establish:
        - That the job offer is **genuine**, and
        - That they have agreed to a **settlement plan** with the prospective employee based on a pre-endorsement needs assessment.
    - To apply for an endorsement in Nova Scotia, an applicant and the employer must fill out the Endorsement Application through **Nova Scotia’s online system**. The complete list can be found in the [Endorsement Application Guidelines](https://novascotiaimmigration.com/wp-content/uploads/AIP-Endorsement-Guidelines-EN.pdf){:target="\_blank"}.
