## Notes

??? note "Tutorial notes"

    - Saturday 9:00am.
    - *Potla v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2020 FC 646](https://canlii.ca/t/j7zwt){:target="\_blank"}
        - Do officers have **a duty to revert back to applicants** if documents are deficient or they have concerns with respect to the contents of the documents?
            - [31] The applicant relies on *Yazdanian v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)*, [1999 CanLII 7710 (FC)](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/1999/1999canlii7710/1999canlii7710.html){:target="\_blank"}, [1999] FCJ No 411, for the proposition that a visa officer has a duty to notify an applicant whenever there are “specific concerns” with the application: see *Yazdanian* at para 18.  However, it is clear in light of more recent jurisprudence that this broad statement about the requirements of procedural fairness is **no longer tenable**: see Penez v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), [2017 FC 1001](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2017/2017fc1001/2017fc1001.html){:target="\_blank"} at paras 33-40.
        - Can an officer refuse if an applicant doesn't meet the **lead statement** in a NOC?
            - [34] The GCMS notes demonstrate that the officer considered the employment letters provided by Scotiabank.  Those notes, when read together with the decision letter and NOC 6235, also demonstrate why the officer refused the application.  The lead statement for the occupation category the applicant relied on – Financial Sales Representative – indicates that, as the title suggests, individuals in this role “sell basic deposit, investment and loan products and services to individuals and businesses.”  The letters from Scotiabank, however, do not say that the applicant sells any such thing to anyone.  Instead, as the respondent points out, the letters suggest that the applicant provided backroom support to others at the bank who did sell such things.  **Under paragraph 87.1(2)(b) of the IRPR, the applicant had to “perform the actions described in the lead statement for the occupation” she cited in her application to qualify.**  A simple comparison of the lead statement for Financial Sales Representatives with the Scotiabank letters demonstrates that this was not the case.  The officer’s determination is justified, transparent and intelligible.
    - *Kumar v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2019 FC 367](https://canlii.ca/t/hzmfl){:target="\_blank"}
        - [20] While I agree that there may be an overlap between the duties of food preparer and cook, the real question for the **visa officer is to determine the pith and substance of the work** performed by the Applicant (*Rodrigues v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2009 FC 111](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2009/2009fc111/2009fc111.html){:target="\_blank"} at para 10). The answer to the question of whether the Applicant performed a substantial number of the main duties of a cook set out in the NOC is “very much a discretionary judgment call. Parliament has said that visa officers are to make that discretionary call and, as the jurisprudence makes clear, the Court cannot countermand a decision unless it falls outside of the range posited in paragraph 47 of *Dunsmuir*” (*Hosseini v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2013 FC 766](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2013/2013fc766/2013fc766.html){:target="\_blank"} at para 54). Deference must be afforded to the assessment of an Applicant’s job experience and its comparison to the NOC job description (*Qin v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2013 FC 147](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2013/2013fc147/2013fc147.html){:target="\_blank"} at para 16, aff’d [2013 FCA 263](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fca/doc/2013/2013fca263/2013fca263.html){:target="\_blank"} at para 25).
        - [24] If the Applicant’s evidence, notably his employer’s letter, had provided details about how the Applicant prepares food items from scratch, it likely would not have been open to the Immigration Officer to conclude that he prepares simple food items by assembling pre-made items. **The onus was on the Applicant to present sufficient evidence that his application met the requirements of the NOC** (*Saatchi v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2018 FC 1037](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2018/2018fc1037/2018fc1037.html){:target="\_blank"} at para 30; *Morgan v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2014 FC 897](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2014/2014fc897/2014fc897.html){:target="\_blank"} at para 15) and the Immigration Officer reasonably concluded that he had not met that burden.

??? note "Module Notes"

    - language is assessed using standards called the **Canada Language Benchmarks** (CLB). In French, the standards are the ***Niveaux de compétence linguistique canadiens***, or NCLC.
    - In English, the three tests are
        - the Canadian English Language Proficiency Index Program (**CELPIP**) “General” test
        - the International English Language Testing System (**IELTS**) “General Training” test (Note that applicants cannot use scores for either the CELPIP “General LS” test or the IELTS “Academic” test.)
        - the Pearson Test of English Core (**PTE Core**) (Note that IRCC started accepting this test in January 2024).
    - In French, the two available tests are the Test d’évaluation de français pour le Canada (**TEF Canada**) and the Test de connaissance du français pour le Canada (**TCF Canada**).
    - ***Bano v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***, [2020 FC 568](http://canlii.ca/t/j7qg5){:target="\_blank"} at paragraph 23:
        - As the Court notes in *Begum* at paragraph [18](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2020/2020fc162/2020fc162.html#par18){:target="\_blank"}, citing *Sarfraz v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2019 FC 1578 (CanLII)](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2019/2019fc1578/2019fc1578.html){:target="\_blank"} at paragraph 22, an Officer’s decision to **deviate** from a provincial nomination must be **justified** in its reasons:
            - [22] In essence, the PNP provides provinces and territories increased flexibility to attract individuals who may not be eligible for federal immigration programs. The RIAS does not indicate, however, that an officer’s assessment of economic establishment must be conducted in the same manner as the province’s or territory’s approach. Rather, it leaves open that **officers at the federal level are entitled to their own interpretations on a file, and may consider additional or altogether different factors when determining whether to substitute an evaluation pursuant to IRPR 87(3)**, as was done here: *Debnath*, above at para 15. While a provincial or territorial nomination decision is owed deference on the government’s assessment of applicable criteria, it is not binding on federal officers: *Chaudhry v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, 2015 FC 1072 [Chaudhry] at para 28; *Sran v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, 2012 FC 791 [Sran] at para 13. Officers must conduct their own analysis objectively, however, to achieve a consistent process [i.e. fair], taking into account their decision should not displace the underlying intent of the applicable program: *Roohi v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2008 FC 1408](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2008/2008fc1408/2008fc1408.html){:target="\_blank"}  at para 31. **Accordingly, any direct challenge to a provincial or territorial conclusion in the nomination process must be justified, transparent and intelligible:** *Dunsmuir v New Brunswick*, [2008 SCC 9 [Dunsmuir]](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2008/2008scc9/2008scc9.html){:target="\_blank"} at para 47.
    - In the case of an educational credential from outside Canada, the applicant must submit their **foreign credential** plus an **educational credential assessment (ECA) report**, by one of several [designated organizations](https://www.cic.gc.ca/english/helpcentre/answer.asp?qnum=681&top=29){:target="\_blank"}. The statutory provisions governing ECA reports are found in subsections **R75(2.1) and (4) to (8)**.

??? note "Inadmissibility"

    - Your clients are screened for inadmissibility based on:
        - a medical examination
        - police certificates
        - biometrics (such as fingerprints)
        - a security screening conducted by the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), sometimes in cooperation with the Canadian Security Intelligence Service (CSIS)
    - Section 38 of the IRPA, states that a foreign national is inadmissible to Canada on health grounds if they have a health condition that is likely to be **a danger to public health**, public safety, or might reasonably be expected to **cause excessive demand on health or social services**.
    - Section 16(2)(b) of the ***IRPA*** requires foreign nationals who make any application under the Act to submit the result of such examinations. Subparagraph 30(1)(a)(i) of the ***IRPR***, make clear that this requirement applies to all foreign nationals:
        - "...foreign nationals who are applying for a permanent resident visa or applying to remain in Canada as a permanent resident, as well as their **family members**, **whether accompanying or not**,"
    - A medical examination must be conducted by an approved panel physician, typically upon receipt of instructions from Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) using form **IMM 1017E**.
    - If there is a concern about medical inadmissibility, responsibility for final assessment of the immigration medical examination is transferred to a **centralized medical inadmissibility unit in Ottawa**.
    - In cases where an immigration medical officer anticipates making a finding of inadmissibility, the applicant must be provided an opportunity to respond. The applicant will receive a [procedural fairness letter](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/standard-requirements/medical-requirements/forms.html){:target="\_blank"} notifying them of the results.
    - An extension may be requested, for instance, in order to make an [Access to Information and Privacy](https://atip-aiprp.apps.gc.ca/atip/welcome.do){:target="\_blank"} request to get hold of the IRCC file. In many cases, that would be **an advisable step** in order to learn more details about an officer’s concerns.
    - The applicant will be given an opportunity to provide additional information on the medical condition and social services identified, as well **the chance to provide an individualized mitigation plan** to ensure no excessive demand will be imposed on Canadian social services, along with a “Declaration of Ability and Intent” form and any supporting evidence.
    - In such cases, in the applicant’s reply they may also request an exemption from inadmissibility on **humanitarian and compassionate grounds** under **IRPA**, s 25.
    - Unlike for medical certificates, the requirements for obtaining **police certificates** is not set out expressly in the legislation. Rather it is found in IRCC’s [online operational instructions](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/express-entry/applications-received-on-after-january-1-2016-completeness-check.html#s04){:target="\_blank"}.
    - The instructions also state that in exceptional circumstances, an officer may accept both proof of having requested a police certificate for some countries and an explanation of how they have made their best efforts to follow up and procure the document.
    - All applicants for permanent resident visas who are **14 years** or older or **79 years** and younger must provide biometric information (see IRPR 12.2(1)(a) and (b)).

??? note "NOC 2021"

    - The NOC is reviewed and reissued every 5 years. The latest revision (NOC 2021) was introduced in November 2022 and was substantial.
    - “TEER Category 0, 1, 2, or 3” refer to high-skilled occupations.
    - Applications for permanent residence will need to show that their experience or job offer meets the kinds of requirements we have referenced, concerning the Federal Skilled Worker Class, Canadian Experience Class, and the Federal Skilled Trades Program. To do so, applicants will **typically need to obtain a letter from their current, former, or future employer** describing their tasks and responsibilities in their job.
    - *Potla v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2020 FC 646](https://canlii.ca/t/j7zwt){:target="\_blank"}.
        - [29]  On the other hand, as Justice Gleeson also explained, if a decision maker has concerns relating to the **credibility of information submitted** in support of an application or to the accuracy or genuineness of that information, **procedural fairness will often require** that the applicant be given an opportunity to address those concerns before a decision is made: see Lazar at para 21.
        - [31]  In the present case, the officer did **not have any concerns about the credibility**, accuracy or genuineness of the information or supporting documents the applicant submitted with her application.  To be precise, there is no suggestion that the officer had any doubt that the applicant had been employed as an Analyst with Scotiabank during the time period indicated in her application.  Rather, the officer was not satisfied that this employment, as described in the documents the applicant submitted in support of her application, was sufficient to satisfy the legal requirements for obtaining permanent residence under the CEC program. **Procedural fairness did not require the officer to alert the applicant to this deficiency in her application before refusing it**.
    - *Kumar v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2019 FC 367](https://canlii.ca/t/hzmfl){:target="\_blank"}.
        - [20]  While I agree that there may be an overlap between the duties of food preparer and cook, the real question for the **visa officer is to determine the pith and substance of the work performed by the Applicant** (Rodrigues v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2009 FC 111 at para 10). The answer to the question of whether the Applicant performed a substantial number of the main duties of a cook set out in the NOC is “very much a discretionary judgment call. Parliament has said that visa officers are to make that discretionary call and, as the jurisprudence makes clear, the Court cannot countermand a decision unless it falls outside of the range posited in paragraph 47 of Dunsmuir” (Hosseini v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 766 at para 54). Deference must be afforded to the assessment of an Applicant’s job experience and its comparison to the NOC job description (Qin v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 147 at para 16, aff’d 2013 FCA 263 at para 25).

## Quizzes

??? note "Knowledge Check 2.1: Language and Educational Credentials"

    1. The **Governor in Council** has the authority to establish minimum language proficiency thresholds under s 74(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        > Under s 74(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, **the Minister** of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship is required to establish minimum official language proficiency thresholds for the Federal Skilled Worker class, the Federal Skilled Trades class, and the Canadian Experience Class.

    2. The standard for assessing language proficiency as part of applications within the economic class is called:

Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2020 FC 568 decision, if a federal visa officer wishes to refuse an application for a permanent resident visa based on their judgment that the applicant under a provincial nominee program fails to meet a language standard, what must the officer do?
        - [ ] Nothing. Even if they disagree with provincial authorities’ assessment of the applicant’s language skills, the visa officer may not deviate from that assessment. Federal visa officers are bound by provincial determinations. That’s why it’s called a provincial nominee program.
        - [ ] To refuse the application, they must explain, in light of the available evidence, how an applicant fails to meet the language standard. They may not, however, consider factors other than those considered by provincial officials.
        - [x] To refuse the application, they must explain, in light of the available evidence, how an applicant fails to meet the language standard. In doing so, they may consider factors other than those considered by provincial officials.
        - [ ] They may refuse the application. First, however, they must seek the concurrence of the federal Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, who must in turn discuss the matter with their provincial counterpart.

        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        > The institution must **be recognized by provincial authorities**. See the definition of “Canadian education credential” in IRPR, s 73.

    7.  In *Bano v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, why did the court conclude the Officer’s reasons demonstrated arbitrariness?
        - [ ] The Officer concluded that the applicant had “almost no proficiency in English”, even though the evidence demonstrates otherwise.
        - [ ] The Officer rejected the application primarily on the basis that they were not satisfied that the principal applicant had the necessary language skills to become economically established in Canada, but did not justify raising the minimum language requirements of CLB 3.
        - [ ] The Officer asserted that there is a significant difference between CLB 6 and CLB 7, and the principal applicant’s CLB 6 score was insufficient, but **did not indicate why they imposed the higher threshold**.
        - [ ] Although the court held the Officer’s decision was unreasonable, it was not found to be arbitrary.

    8. Which of the following statements best summarizes the grounds for the decision of Ahmed J in *Bano v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, 2020 FC 568?
        - [ ] The visa officer’s decision refusing the application under the Provincial Nominee Program was unreasonable because the principal applicant failed to take an approved language test.

    9. Who has the **authority** to establish minimum language proficiency thresholds; under which provision; and for which economic classes?
        - [ ] The Ministre de l’Immigration, de la Francisation et de l’Intégration du Québec; under s 86(1) of the IRPR; for the Quebec Skilled Worker class.
        - [ ] The Governor in Council; under section 95 of the Constitution Act, 1867; for all economic classes.
        - [x] The federal **Minister** of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship; under **s. 74(1)** of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations, or IRPR; for the **Federal Skilled Worker** class, the **Federal Skilled Trades** class, and the **Canadian Experience Class**.

    10. Your client received their results from their International English Language Testing System (IELTS) language test on June 10, 2021. They created an Express Entry profile on June 30, 2021 but did not receive an invitation to apply within the next year. They created a new profile on August 30, 2022, which they updated on April 15, 2023 upon completing their bachelor's degree. They then received an invitation to apply under the Federal Skilled Worker Class on May 15, 2023. It is now June 13, 2023. Can they rely on their IELTS language test scores from 2021? Please refer to the relevant section of the IRPR in giving your answer.
        - [ ] Yes. The language test results with an application under the Federal Skilled Worker Class must be no more than five years old: IRPR, s 75(2)(e)(ii)
        - [x] No. The language test results **submitted** with an application under the Federal Skilled Worker Class must be **no more than two years old**: IRPR, s 75(2)(d).
        - [ ] Yes. Although the language test is more than 2 years old, your client falls within an exception in paragraph 11.2(2) of the IRPA.
        - [ ] Maybe. Although the language test is more than 2 years old, the officer has the discretion to consider it along with an interview with your client in order to assess their language proficiency.

    11. A client made an application to the Federal Skilled Worker Class on September 1, 2022. As part of their application, they submitted their foreign education credential plus an **equivalency assessment**, which was dated June 1, 2018. Does this assessment meet the requirements of the Regulations?
        - [ ] No. The assessment must be no more than two years old.
        - [x] Yes. The report must be **less than 5 years old**, which is satisfied here.
        - [ ] Yes. An educational credential assessment report is the gold standard for proof of foreign credentials. An officer may reject it, but their decision will be unreasonable.
        - [ ] No. The assessment is not conclusive that the foreign credentials are equivalent to Canadian educational credentials.
        > See IRPR, s 75(2)(e)(ii).

    12. Deaf applicants cannot fulfill the testing requirement for listening skills. For that reason they cannot apply under the Economic Class.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        > Under the [Public policy concerning economic class permanent residence applicants and Express Entry candidates whose language proficiency cannot be tested in all four language skill areas due to a physical or mental disability (1 January 2015)](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/language-proficiency.html){:target="\_blank"} -- which has been assigned to you and for which you are responsible --, the applicant would be able to count the average of their scores for the language skill areas for which they were able to be tested as a “notionalized” score for the remaining skill area.

??? note "Knowledge Check 2.2: Police Checks, Medical Exams & Admissibility"

    1. Which of the following counts as “health services” for the purposes of inadmissibility on health grounds under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act?
        - [ ] Government-funded home care.
        - [x] The services of government-funded physicians.

        - [ ] Your client's application will be rejected as incomplete. They will have to reapply through Express Entry and hope that, if they are accepted again, the FGR will be more responsive.

??? note "Knowledge Check 2.3: Introduction to NOC"

    1. In *Kumar*, which of the following is **not** the reason that the Immigration Officer’s decision was reasonable?
        - [ ] It was reasonable for the Immigration Officer to conclude that the Applicant does not prepare a wide variety of foods because the Applicant only prepares a limited variety of simple foods.
        - [ ] The Immigration Officer examined the differences between the main duties of a cook and those of a food preparer. The Officer concluded that the Applicant’s duties were closer to those of a food preparer because the duties do not regularly involve overseeing kitchen staff and operations and the Applicant’s main duties involve preparing simple fast foods.
        - [ ] The Immigration Officer noted that the Applicant did not provide any evidence with respect to whether the Applicant cooks the necessary components for the food items, or simply using re-made items to assemble them together to finalize the product.
        - [x] The Immigration Officer drew from his/her own experience as a cook to conclude that the Applicant’s duties were insufficient to be considered a cook.

    2. What grounds did the officer give for rejecting Ms. Potla’s application for permanent residence?
        - [ ] That Ms Potla's application was incomplete. Her file did not contain the biometrics necessary for all permanent resident applications.
        - [x] That Ms Potla had not satisfied the officer that she had performed the actions described in the lead statement for the occupation she had identified, nor that she had performed a substantial number of the main duties listed for that occupation.
        - [ ] That Ms Potla’s husband, Jampani Sravan Kumar, was inadmissible because he was likely to cause excessive demand on health and social services in Canada. Ms Potla’s proposed mitigation plan was insufficient to address the officer’s concerns.
        - [ ] That Ms Potla did not meet the language requirements for the Canadian experience class. Although Ms Potla’s future occupation is classified as corresponding to Skill Level B, thereby requiring that she achieve a minimum Canadian Language Benchmark (CLB) score of 6 for all language skill areas, she only achieved CLB in reading and writing.

    3. Ms Potla argued that the officer breached procedural fairness by not giving her a chance to address concerns about her application. On which of the following bases did Norris J reject this procedural argument?
        - [ ] While there is an obligation on a decision maker to notify an applicant of deficiencies in the application itself, in this case the deficiency was found in the supporting documentation.
        - [x] The officer’s concerns had to do with **whether Ms Potla satisfied the criteria to be admitted under the Canadian experience class, not with her credibility**. The officer therefore had no obligation to alert Ms Potla of this deficiency before refusing the application.
        - [ ] While the degree of procedural fairness owed on Canadian experience class application is on the high end of the spectrum, those obligations were fulfilled by the various information for applicants posted on the Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) website.
        - [ ] The IRCC bears the onus of showing why an application should be refused; in this case the officer’s reasons satisfy that onus.

    4. Your client is a "bar manager." Her employer described his work as: "Sandy Squirrel has been employed at The Salty Spittoon since June 2022.

        - [ ] False
        > True. Although there was some overlap between the duties of a cook the applicant’s responsibilities, “[t]angential performance of one or more functions under one or more job categories does not convert the job or the functions from one NOC category to another.” See **paragraph 25** of the decision.

        - [ ] Courts will review a visa officer's assessment of job experience on a standard of **reasonableness**.
