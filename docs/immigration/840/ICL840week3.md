## Notes

???+ note "Tutorial notes"

    - Saturday 9:00am.
    - **Express Entry:** the Federal Skilled Worker Class (**FSW**), the Canadian Experience Class (**CEC**), the Federal Skilled Trades Class (**FST**), and the Provincial Nominee Class (**PNP**).
    - Because immigration practices often provide questionnaires to potential clients, you can easily find examples online.  Here is a sampling:

        - [Achtari Law](https://www.immigrationcan.com/questionnaire/){:target="\_blank"}
    - EOI -> CRS -> Draw -> ITA -> 60 days to apply for PR

    - A11.2: qualifications must meet when ITA received and Application submitted.
    - If you have a spouse who doesn't bring a lot of points to the CRS, could you apply as a single? In practice, you can do that, but not recommended because of ethical issue.

??? note "Breaking Down the Ministerial Instructions"

    - [Ministerial Instructions respecting the Express Entry system](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/ministerial-instructions/express-entry-application-management-system/current.html){:target="\_blank"}
    - the Instructions can be thought of as having three parts:
        - First, provisions determining the **scope and requirements** for Express Entry eligibility.
        - Next, provisions determining the **mechanics**, such as how long invitations to apply last.
        - Finally, provisions governing the awarding of **points** under the Comprehensive Ranking System, which determine who will receive invitations to apply.
    - The statutory authority for Express Entry is found in [Division 0.1](https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/i-2.5/page-2.html#h-274208){:target="\_blank"} of the IRPA.In that division, subsection 10.1(1) imposes on foreign nationals in certain circumstances the requirement that they receive an invitation before applying for permanent residence.
    - section 1 and subsection 7(2): definitions.
    - Section 2: classes for which the Express Entry system will be used.
        - a foreign national must meet the minimum requirements and selection criteria for at least one of either the Federal Skilled Worker, Canadian Experience or Federal Skilled Trades to be accepted into the Express Entry pool.
        -  [operational instructions for Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/express-entry/assessing-electronic-application-on-section-a11-2.html){:target="\_blank"} states that: “**Settlement funds** are not included in the CRS. They do, however, relate to the program requirements of **FSW and FST** and may, by extension, be included in the [minimum eligibility criteria] for Express Entry.
    - Sections 3, 4, 6 and 7:  Mechanics
        - Under subsection 3(6), an expression of interest is considered **received** on the day and time recorded in the Express Entry system. Under section 4, if eligible, it then remains in the pool for up to **1 year**. During that time, section 7 of the Instructions permits the Minister to **share information** with the provinces for the purposes of facilitating a foreign national’s selection under a provincial nominee program.
        - There are two ways that the foreign national can leave the pool before the year is up.
            - First, they may receive an invitation to apply.
            - Second, they may leave the pool because they cease to be eligible for the pool. (expiry of language result)
    - Sections 8-32: The Comprehensive Ranking System, which is made up of **four** type of factors
        - Core human capital factors: **500** points if they have no accompanying spouse or common-law partner, or **460** points if they do.
        - Accompanying spouse or common-law partner factors: **40**
        - Skill transferability factors: **100**
        - Additional factors: **600**

??? note "Qualifying Job Offers"

    - Immigration Minister Marc Miller has confirmed that Express Entry points for a job offer will be **removed** in the **Spring of 2025**, exact date and circumstances have not yet been confirmed.
    - subsection 29(1) of the Instructions allots either **200** or **50** points for having a “qualifying job offer.”
    - for a job offer to count as arranged employment, it must be:
        - made by a **single employer**;
        - other than an embassy, high commission or consulate in Canada or **an employer who is referred to in any of subparagraphs 200(3)(h)(i) to (iii) of the IRPR**;
            - Note that subparagraphs 200(3)(h)(i) to (iii) refer to employers who have failed to provide wages and working conditions in conformity with job offers that were the basis of previous work permits or employers who have failed to pay an administrative monetary penalty due to previous non-compliance;
        - for continuous, **full-time** work in Canada;
        - having a duration of at least **1 year after** the date on which a permanent resident visa is issued;
        - that is in an occupation that is listed in Skill Type 0 Management Occupations or Skill Level A or B of the NOC 2016 and **TEER 0,1,2,3** of NOC 2021.
    - In addition to meeting the definition of “arranged employment” from subsection 82(1) of the IRPR, the job offer for a non-trade occupation under paragraph 29(2)(a) must fulfil **one of three** further conditions.
        - there must be a valid **LMIA** for the job offer,
        - the offer is to **continue** a job that the foreign national already occupies under a valid work permit issued based on a positive **LMIA**, **or**
        - the offer is to continue a job for which the foreign national already holds a valid work permit but for which they did not need an LMIA (i.e., because the work fell under the **International Mobility Program**).

??? note "Case Review: Express Entry System"

    - *Agbai v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2019 FC 886](http://canlii.ca/t/j1b0m){:target="\_blank"}.
        - points locked-in time: ITA and Application.
    - *Singh v Canada (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship)*, [2017 FC 266](http://canlii.ca/t/h0r1p){:target="\_blank"}.
        - [8] Whether a visa officer erred by failing to bring his or her concerns to the attention of an applicant and offering the applicant an opportunity to address them is a question of procedural fairness which is **reviewable on the correctness standard** (*Dunsmuir v New Brunswick*, 2008 SCC 9 at paras 79 and 87 (“Dunsmuir”); *Muthui* at para 12; *Ramezanpour v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, 2016 FC 751 at para 15).
        - [9] The standard of review that applies to an officer’s assessment of an application for permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Worker Program, including the officer’s assessment of the evidence submitted in support of that application, **is reasonableness** (Hamza v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 264 at para 14 (“Hamza”); Roberts v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2009 FC 518 at para 15; Bazaid v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 17 at para 36; Khowaja v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2013 FC 823 at para 7; Muthui at para 10).  An officer’s assessment in that regard is entitled to a high degree of deference (Pathirannahelage v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2015 FC 811 at para 25 (“Pathirannahelage”)).
        - [30] ... s 82 of the IRPR requires that an employer has offered arranged employment to the applicant, which is defined as an offer of employment “for continuous full-time work in Canada having a duration of at least one year after the date on which a permanent resident visa is issued”
    - *Singh v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2017 FC 132](http://canlii.ca/t/h03cj){:target="\_blank"}.
        - [8] The Officer’s failure to refer to this evidence or to explain why it was insufficient to overcome the initial concern about Mr.  Singh’s work experience renders the decision unreasonable.
        - [10] The Officer’s lingering concern about an overlap between Mr. Singh’s accounting studies and his employment was also misplaced.  If the Officer had taken care to examine the relevant records, he could only have concluded that Mr. Singh’s accreditation studies required corresponding internship employment.  The fact that he was studying and working at the same time was not suspicious – it was expected.
        - [12] The rejection of Mr. Singh’s permanent residency application appears to have been based on the Officer’s after-the-fact assessment of the merits of Mr. Singh’s previous temporary visa applications.  Whether or not those earlier visa applications ought to have been accepted was not before the Officer.  The Officer’s failure to engage with the evidence presented in support of the application before him is fatal to the decision and the decision is, accordingly, set aside.
