    - [ ] True, RCICs are required to be members of CICC, which is a professional association.

2. Mo visits RCIC Pedro and explains that he wishes to sponsor his family. He has lived in Canada for three years and feels he is now financially ready to bring them to join him. During their meeting, Pedro asks clarifying questions to fully understand Mo’s situation. He eventually learns that Mo would like to sponsor his two wives and four children. 

    Pedro carefully and respectfully explains that although it is acceptable in Mo’s country of origin to have more than one legal spouse, Canadian immigration law only allows one spouse to be sponsored in a spousal sponsorship application. He also adds that all of the children may be included in the application. Mo appears troubled by this information but thanks Pedro for the explanation. 

    Did Pedro respond with appropriate cultural sensitivity while explaining the legal limitations?

    - [ ] No, Pedro should have told Mo directly to choose one wife without further explanation.
    - [ ] No, Pedro should have advised Mo to divorce one wife and proceed with the application.
    - [x] Yes, Pedro appropriately explained Canadian immigration law with cultural sensitivity. 
    - [ ] Yes, because Pedro focused on the children's eligibility, which was the most culturally sensitive part of the conversation.

5. RCIC Kareem is designing his firm’s new client intake form. To help build rapport, he adds a mandatory question asking clients to share a “fun fact” about their culture. His goal is to show openness and interest in diversity. Is this a culturally competent approach? 
    - [x] No, Kareem's question is not culturally competent; Kareem needs to rephrase the question so that clients know how it supports his service delivery and that it's optional. 
    - [ ] Yes, Kareem's question is culturally competent because it allows clients to define their own identities.
    - [ ] No, Kareem's question is not culturally competent because immigration practitioners should not ask questions about clients' identities unless it's clear how such questions support service delivery. 
    - [ ] No, Kareem's question is not culturally competent because it pressures clients to disclose personal information. 

6. Dan is an RCIC whose immediate supervisor is Germaine. Dan has been working with a client who has been uncooperative in providing documentation required for a work permit application. Dan feels that something is wrong with the information he has received so far, but the client assures Dan that everything is genuine when Dan asks him about some inconsistencies in the information. Eventually Dan decides to discuss the situation with Germaine. Germaine reviews all the information and tells Dan that he should just go ahead and submit the application with the client’s information. Dan feels certain that the client has provided fraudulent documents in order to meet a deadline for the application submission.

    What is Dan’s best course of action?

    - [ ] Submit the application as is; his supervisor bears the responsibility if the application is rejected.
    - [ ] Submit the application as is; RCIC Dan has a duty to "meet all applicable deadlines." 
    - [x] Ascertain that the information is correct, irrespective of her supervisor's assessment and the coming deadline.
    - [ ] Refuse to submit the application but advise the client that they can file on their own if they wish to meet the coming deadline. 
    > As an RCIC, Dan has a professional and ethical obligation to ascertain that the information is correct before submitting an application, regardless of the coming deadline or external pressures. While it may seem reasonable to take the matter to his supervisor or to refuse to submit and let the client proceed independently, these steps do not replace Dan's personal responsibility to verify the accuracy of the information. Filing the application without doing so could lead to serious professional misconduct. Dan must take the necessary steps to confirm the accuracy of the information himself before proceeding.

9. Shiraz wished to sponsor her niece, Andrea, as an adopted child. She seeks help from RCIC Sandra who has a lot of questions about the situation. Sandra asks about Andrea’s parents. She feels that Shiraz is trying to evade answering the question directly, instead focussing on the life she will offer to Andrea in Canada. She has plans to enrol Andrea in a very good private school and summer enrichment program. Sandra needs to know if a genuine parent-child relationship has been established between Shiraz and Andrea. To ensure that she gets the information she needs during the interview, what should Sandra do to keep the interview on track? 
    - [ ] Ask Shiraz to email her with additional details about the school and summer enrichment program.

10. RCIC Dana previously worked as a crisis counselor in a high-risk environment where she regularly supported survivors of violence. Many of her most distressing encounters involved male perpetrators, and the trauma of those years still affects her. 

    Now, as an immigration consultant, Dana feels uncomfortable working with male clients and prefers to accept only female clients into her practice. She believes this helps her feel safe and emotionally stable at work. 

    Does Dana’s current client preference reflect any personal or cultural bias? 

    - [ ] Yes, but because Dana's intention is to protect herself, it is not relevant to professional ethics.
    - [x] Yes, Dana's decision to exclude male clients based on past trauma reflects a gender-based bias that must be addressed.

    - [ ] No, Dana is simply setting boundaries that protect her mental health and safety.
    > Dana's trauma is real and deserves care and support. However, as a regulated professional, **excluding clients based on gender without a case-specific justification reflects bias and raises ethical concerns**. Professionals are encouraged to seek supervision, support, or referral processes that balance their well-being with non-discriminatory service delivery. 

11. Benji has been an RCIC for five years. He recently got divorced and his wife has custody of his two children. His practice has been struggling as he was preoccupied with the divorce and custody arrangements. He has fallen behind on payments to his ex-wife for child support and she has successfully gained an order to garnish his employment income. He is working on a remedy for the situation, so he does not need to notify the regulator. 
    - [ ] Benji is only required to report the garnishment if he fails to find a remedy within two weeks of the occurrence.
    - [ ] Benji is not required to report the garnishment because it is related to his personal life, not his practice.

13. Janet is a new RCIC working to build her practice. She has offered some of her personal contacts referral fees if they send her clients who later sign a retainer agreement. Is Janet’s business strategy permitted under the Code of Professional Conduct? 
    - [ ] Yes, because the Code allows licensees to offer inducements to agents they intend to work with.
    - [x] No, because the Code prohibits a licensee from offering referral fees. 
    - [ ] Yes, because the Code permits licensees to accept inducements in certain situations.
    - [ ] No, because the Code permits licensees to solicit inducements only from organizations, not individuals.

14. Sanjay is an RCIC based in Victoria, British Columbia. Many of his clients are international students applying for study permits to begin or continue their education in Canada. Since these clients often have a long immigration journey ahead, Sanjay wants to maintain regular communication with them to provide ongoing support and build long-term client relationships. Even when clients are in the same city, meeting in person is not always feasible. 

    Which combination of communication methods is the most professionally appropriate for maintaining contact with clients over time?

    - [ ] Sarah must successfully pass the College's Entry-to-Practice Exam (RISIA EPE); and follow the licensing process to obtain her licence.
    - [ ] B & C

Therefore, Sarah can assume the role without completing the ISIEP program or writing the RISIA Entry-to-Practice Exam.
