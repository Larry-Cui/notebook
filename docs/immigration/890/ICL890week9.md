??? note "Effective Writing in Submissions"

    - Every application you submit on behalf of your clients to IRCC should be accompanied by a **submission letter** (also called a “**cover letter**”).
    - Example of critical elements
        - **Address** of visa office or case processing centre 
        - **Date** 
        - **Salutation** - Dear Sir or Madam, (or the name of the person if known) 
        - Referbence – client name, DOB, PPT #, their file number, and UCI if known, your file number - use this level of detail to ensure that if the letter goes astray from the file at any time, the visa office will be able to marry it back up to the file. Also, lots of people have the same name and this level of identifying detail will help to differentiate your client from others with the same or similar name. 
        - **Introduction** - what the letter is about – the type of case with IRPA/IRPR references 
            - I/We have been retained by the above-named with respect to an application for permanent resident status in Canada in the In Canada Spousal category of the Family Class of applications, made pursuant to s.12(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) and s.1 (1) and 117(1) and related provisions of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR). 
        - **Who you are** and your authorization (ie. under the privacy act) 
            - Enclosed please find my Authorization (IMM 5476) from the applicant, pursuant to the Privacy Act, completed application forms, photographs of the applicant, proof of payment of processing fees, Appendix, and related supporting documentation.  
        - **Fee payment** details (included, paid online and receipt attached, etc.) 
        - Substituted evaluation **requests** where appropriate.
            - In particular, should it be determined that the applicant does not meet the required pass mark, it is respectfully requested that consideration under R 87(3) and (4) be given to the application of positive “substituted evaluation”, since such a points assessment, for the reasons given below, would not be a sufficient indicator of the applicant’s ability to become economically established in Canada. 
        - Identification of related **case law** if appropriate 
        - Detailed **explanation and application of law** and/or legal test if appropriate 
        - How a client meets the **requirements** of the particular program – narrative 
        - Threshold issues of **admissibility** and **eligibility** 
        - Summary including how you can be **contacted** 
        - **Signature** including your name, designation (RCIC), and R # (CICC #) 
        - **Appendix** noting included forms and supporting documents, if not mentioned in the body of the letter, including fee payment, forms, other required documents, photos, etc. 

??? note "Completeness Checks Pursuant to **IRPR section 10**"

    - R10(1): Subject to paragraphs 28(b) to (d) and 139(1)(b), an application under these Regulations shall 
        - (a) be made in writing using the form, if any, provided by the Department or, in the case of an application for a declaration of relief under subsection 42.1(1) of the Act, by the Canada Border Services Agency; 
        - (b) be signed by the applicant; 
        - (c) include all information and documents required by these Regulations, as well as any other evidence required by the Act; 
        - (d) be accompanied by evidence of payment of the applicable fee, if any, set out in these Regulations; and 
        - (e) if there is an accompanying spouse or common-law partner, identify who is the principal applicant and who is the accompanying spouse or common-law partner. 
    - Section 12 of IRPR further prescribes that “if the requirements of sections 10 and 11 are not met, the application and all documents submitted in support of it, shall be **returned** to the applicant.” This means that the application may be declined for processing or may be refused (as incomplete).   
    - Even applications submitted through the portals can encounter difficulties with lost documents. In those cases, it is likely that you will receive the application back as incomplete. If so, remedy the situation by re-uploading the "missing" document and re-submit. 

??? note "PFL"

    - The requirement for procedural fairness applies to all types of immigration and citizenship applications and all aspects of decision-making. They follow this process by issuing applicants with a Procedural Fairness Letter (PFL). This letter is sent in the form of an **email** and carefully outlines the officer’s concerns or “suspicions.”
    - The structure of a PFL response should follow these two principles:
        - **In-depth, individualized** assessment and analysis for a client’s case
        - **Well-researched**, **well-organized** arguments with **supporting information**  
    - Keeping in mind these two principles, follow the guidance below to prepare your response: 
        - Decide your **angle**. 
            - Do you agree with IRCC’s assessment? Even if you wish otherwise, perhaps you can’t deny that your client may not be 100% eligible for a certain program, but you still believe that the application should be approved based on certain factors. In this case, your thesis should **acknowledge IRCC’s perspective** but still argue for your client’s application to negate concerns. Highlight any **humanitarian or compassionate reasons**, find legal precedent where exemptions to program requirements may have been granted, or ask for administrative discretion. 
            - Do you disagree with IRCC’s assessment? **State the thesis of the letter early** – to demonstrate that IRCC’s assessment was not substantiated, was made in error, or breached procedural fairness 
        - **Research**. Whichever angle you decide to take in your response, undertake as much background reading on the topic as you can. You should not limit yourself to only reading case law or IRPA and the Regulations. Research can involve reading medical journals, pharmaceutical research, or conducting interviews with relevant authority figures in the matter.
        - Prepare your **outline**. Decide how many topics in your argument you would like to present – usually 3-4 topics will suffice. Each topic should clearly center around an argument with factual evidence to support each. Draft a “road map” to layout each topic. Move around paragraphs to ensure that the flow of your arguments makes sense. 
        - Write the **draft** using your outline. 
            - **Introduction** 
            - **Background** of relevant facts on the application: 
                - When was the application submitted? 
                - Which province was the client intended to settle? 
                - How did the client meet eligibility criteria? 
                - Did the client have arranged employment, if this was an economic class application? 
                - Did you already address the officer’s potential concerns in your submission letter?   
            - Your **thesis/angle** 
                - Agree with the officer? What argument are you trying to make for your client in this case? 
                - Disagree? Do you think the officer has made an error in their assessment or understanding of the application? 
            - Your **arguments** and **supporting details**. Cite all sources correctly using footnotes or directly in the body of your submission 
            - Your **conclusion**, with an appendix of a list of documentation you are enclosing. Do not include links to websites for the officer to find themselves. If you want to include information from a website, save it as a PDF and include it with the application directly. This way, you can be sure that the officer will have definitely read it. 

??? note "Application Request for Reconsideration"

    - If you feel that the application was refused in error, you can submit a request for IRCC to **reconsider** the refusal. This should be done as soon as possible, preferably within the same business day, or no more than 1-2 business days following receipt of the refusal letter.
    - Much like writing procedural fairness letters, a request for reconsideration must be based on **factual evidence**, with detailed **arguments** that substantiate your belief that an error was made. Essentially, you are arguing that the officer has made an error in the law or an error of mixed fact and law. The refusal must be a matter that would be overturned by the Immigration Appeal Division in an appeal, or at the Federal Court.
    - You should follow the **same process** in writing this request, as you do when writing a response to a procedural fairness letter.

??? note "Absences"

    - The Planned or Unplanned Absence Regulation defines such instances as a “**voluntary** closure of practice, death, incapacity, suspension or revocation, leave of absence, missing person, or extended travel outside of the country in which the Member ordinarily resides and/or works.”
    - Leaves of absence can include family and medical reasons, returning to full-time studies, accepting a contract with the government, or even retirement. 
    - An RCIC who owns an immigration or consulting practice (either as a sole proprietor or an incorporated company), must prepare a **Contingency Plan** that will protect their clients’ files in the event of a planned or unplanned leave of absence. Of course, you should also have an updated **Business Continuity Plan** in addition to your Contingency Plan.
        - The business continuity plan outlines the most important parts of your business, identifies potential risks to those parts, and includes processes to ensure your business is able to continue operating if unexpected events occur. 
        - Contingency planning is an important part of business continuity planning. A contingency plan is a backup for your original plan; it is your "Plan B".
    - As part of your continuity plan, you will need to **designate someone** who will be the primary contact for your clients and the regulator in the event of your absence. This person will essentially take over your practice and work on your files until you are in a position to resume work.
    - A “**Responsible Person**,” in the context of a Contingency Plan, is someone who will be the primary contact for your clients and the CICC in the event of your planned or unplanned absence.
    - Your **contingency plan must include**:
        - **A system** to address emergencies that may arise in your client files in the event of a Planned or Unplanned Absence from your practice
        - Accurate and up-to-date information on **office procedures**
        - Accurate and up-to-date information on **other areas of your practice**
        - Steps to take to facilitate the **transition** to a new Authorized Representative (also known as the Responsible Person) 
        - Process to **notify the Regulator** in the event of incapacitation or other medical conditions, death, or declaration of being a missing person 

## Quizzes

??? note "Knowledge Check 9.1: Managing Client Files"

    1. You have been retained to submit Helen's application for permanent residence under the Family Class. Helen is accompanied by her older daughter, Jane, for whom she holds sole legal and physical custody.  Helen's younger daughter, Alice, is in the physical and legal custody of her former husband, who has refused to allow Alice to accompany Helen to Canada.  Helen tells you that there is no way her former husband will relent, so has made the difficult decision to leave Alice out of her application.  On your submission letter, you should still include Alice on the application and request an exemption be made for her to be examined.   
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False

    2. You should only submit a written request for IRCC to reconsider a refused application when you can provide legal evidence to counter the decision. 
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False

    3. RCIC Beatrice is preparing to submit an application for permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Worker Class. Her client, Franco, previously resided in Spain for many years as a member of his country's diplomatic service. Franco has applied but has not yet received his police clearance certificate. Should Beatrice submit this application without the police certificate? 
        - [ ] Yes, because police clearance certificates are not required to be submitted with permanent residence applications.
        - [x] No, because the application will be considered incomplete.
        - [ ] Yes, because diplomats are not required to submit police clearance certificates.
        - [ ] No, because in addition to police certificates, diplomats are required to submit approval in writing from their diplomatic service to immigrate.

    4. Marley is a RCIC who has been retained to represent Janko in his application for a work permit. Janko's husband, Stavros, was previously convicted of an indictable offence in the United States. However, he completed his sentence over 20 years ago. Marley advises Janko that he has been "deemed rehabilitated", and thus does not mention this in the submission letter she writes for the application.  Since Stavros has obviously been rehabilitated, Marley does not need to mention his conviction in her submission letter. 
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
    > Although Stavros may have been "deemed rehabilitated", Marley must still prepare submissions to establish and advocate that fact to IRCC.  

    5. RCIC Penny is preparing a submission letter on behalf of her client's application for a Study Permit. Her client, June, was previously convicted of "trespassing" in her country of origin, which can be equated to a summary offence in Canada. June has provided a police clearance certificate that specifies it as her only conviction. Since June is not inadmissible to Canada, Penny only needs to mention this information and provide reference to the relevant provisions of IRPA and the Criminal Code of Canada on the submission letter. 
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False

    6. The requirement for applicants to submit a complete application to IRCC is prescribed in section 10 of IRPA. 
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
    > The Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) sets out broad principles, while the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR) provide detailed requirements such as the need for a complete application, found at **s. 10(1) of IRPR**.

    7. Over the last few weeks, you have been retained by four new clients, whose case details are as follows. Whose application should be **prioritized LAST**? 
        1. Zoe: retained you to assist her in submitting a response to a procedural fairness letter on an application that she initially submitted herself.  She needs your help in collecting the documents in addition to writing a response. 
        2. Oona: will be graduating from her master's program in two months and has retained you to assist her in applying for a Temporary Resident Visa now, as well as a Post-Graduation Work Permit after she graduates.
        3. Alex: submitted an application for PR under the self-employed class and has received a notice to appear for an interview three weeks from today.  He is nervous about it and has retained you to help him prepare for the interview.
        4. Pom: retained you years ago to assist him in sponsoring his parents under the parent/grandparent sponsorship program. His parents' application has been approved.  He delivered their passports to your office three weeks ago for you to courier them to the visa office for visa issuance.   
        - [ ] Zoe
        - [x] Oona
        - [ ] Alex
        - [ ] Pom

    8. Over the last few weeks, you have been retained by four new clients, whose case details are as follows. Whose application should be **prioritized** for completion as soon as possible?
        1. Marisol: graduated two months ago, retained you to assist her in applying for a Post-Graduate Work Permit as her current employer would like her to be able to start working full time as soon as possible. 
        2. Walter: holds an employer-specific work permit expiring at the end of the year but has been laid off. His new employer retained you to start a LMIA application. 
        3. Katie: received an invitation to apply for PR 55 days ago but has been struggling to collect documents for PR by himself. Retained you to help him submit the application before the deadline. 
        4. Hortense: will be eligible to apply for citizenship in two weeks.  Retained you to assist her on her citizenship application. She is a protected person in Canada who has been desperate to visit her family in her home country.  
        - [ ] Marisol
        - [ ] Walter
        - [x] Katie
        - [ ] Hortense

    9. Stacy is an RCIC who prepared and submitted an application for permanent residence on behalf of her client Fung.  Stacy accidentally uploaded the same passport copy for two of Fung's children.  The application was returned by IRCC as incomplete, because a valid passport copy was not included for one of the children.  Stacy should immediately request the application to be reopened as IRCC has breached the rules of procedural fairness by not giving her an opportunity to disabuse their concerns. 
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False

    10. IRCC's triage system is used by visa offices to accurately prioritize applications based on urgency and current political situations around the world. 
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
    > Under the **triage system**, each application is reviewed to ensure all application forms are filled in and signed, the supporting documentation is valid and the correct format, and the fees have been properly paid. 

    11. RCIC Denver submitted an application for a Temporary Resident Visa on behalf of Imam Khan, who had received an invitation from a local mosque to lead prayer and religious services. The application was refused. Denver believes that it was refused in error as the refusal letter did not address any of the important factors that Denver had noted in the application.  Imam Khan asks Denver to file an application for leave at the Federal Court to judicially review the decision.  Since Denver cannot represent Imam Khan at the Federal Court, he should submit a request to the visa office for reconsideration, citing that an error has been made.   
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
    > Imam Khan, as the client, has given Denver specific instructions on how he would like the application to proceed. Since Denver cannot file an application for leave at the Federal Court, **he should instead refer Imam Khan to a lawyer who is able to file the application.**   

    12. You are an RCIC who submitted an application for permanent residence under the Family Class, on behalf of your clients Maeve and Ursula, who are common-law partners. Several months later, you receive a procedural fairness letter from the immigration officer, citing their concern that Maeve and Ursula have not fully established a **common-law relationship** at the time of submission. In preparing a response to address the officer's letter, what is the most important piece of information that should be emphasized? 
        - [ ] That Maeve and Ursula had met and begun dating at least a year ago
        - [ ] That Maeve and Ursula have opened a joint bank account and joint utility statements
        - [x] That Maeve and Ursula have established a joint household at least a year ago
        - [ ] That Maeve and Ursula have combined their assets

    13. When writing a submission letter in support of a permanent residence application, which of the following should you **include**? Select all that apply.
        - [ ] A description of the client's extended family composition in their country of origin.
        - [x] A description of political conflicts in the client's country of origin to explain why the client is unable to obtain a certain document. 
        - [x] An explanation of the client's employment history to emphasize their eligibility under the program.
        - [x] A description of the client's full education history to support the selection factor points the client is claiming.

    14. Prior to submitting his client's application for permanent residence, RCIC Miguel undertook a final check of documents using the application guide on IRCC's website. Miguel found that two of the application forms had been updated on the website. He reviewed the new application forms and compared them with the ones that had already been completed in the application, and found that the format is the same, with no changes whatsoever to the question fields. A senior RCIC advises him that the forms were updated the previous day. Miguel's client signed and dated their application forms a week ago. Although the date of their signatures was from a week ago, Miguel must complete the application to include the new forms. 
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False
    > IRCC does not explicitly allow a "grace period" to use older versions of forms, so **all application forms must be the most current version** prior to submitting the file.
