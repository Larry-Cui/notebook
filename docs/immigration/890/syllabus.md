## Missed Plenary sessions or tutorials

Students who miss plenary sessions or tutorials are required to view the video recording of the session and submit a **one-page (250-word) brief** that includes both a summary of the session and a critical reflection on its content **within seven days** after the missed session or such other date as approved by the instructor.

Repeated absences and/or failure to submit the required reflection will negatively impact your learning. It will also impact your Engagement grade in the course. 

## Skills Reflection for ICL890

The Skills Reflection in Immigration Practice Management (ICL 890) will differ from your previous Skills Reflections insofar as you will be asked to use a wider lens, that is, to **discuss your growth over the GDipICL Program as a whole** rather than only in this course.

Your target word count for this assignment is **400 (+/- 50 words)**.

## Plenaries: Zoom link and recordings

Plenaries are scheduled on **Tuesday** each week of the course at **8:00 PM (ET)**.
