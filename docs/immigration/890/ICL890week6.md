    - Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada, “Procedural fairness” (22 August 2018), [online: Government of Canada/Gouvernement du Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/procedural-fairness.html){:target="\_blank"}.
    - **Cultural competence** is defined as: **the ability to effectively interact with people from cultures different from one’s own, especially through a knowledge and appreciation of cultural differences**.
    - **Equity**: Guarantee of fair treatment, access, opportunity. Goes beyond formal equality; differential treatment according to need may be required.
    - **Diversity**: In broad terms, diversity is any dimension that can be used to differentiate groups and people from one another. It means **respect for and appreciation of differences in ethnicity, gender, age, national origin, ability, sexual orientation, faith, socio-economic status, and class.** But it also includes **differences in life experiences, learning and working styles, and personality types** that can be engaged to achieve excellence.
    - **Indigenization**: Indigenization is a process or action that focusses on **incorporating Indigenous knowledges into approaches in recognition of the value** and importance of including in the university system. An example of this usage is the Indigenization of the curriculum in many of the Queen’s faculties. Indigenization is an action word, and towards this, Queen's is ensuring that Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Indigenization (EDII) are incorporated into plans across the university.
    - **Unconscious Biases**: Unconscious (or implicit, hidden) biases are **mental processes that operate outside of our consciousness, intentional awareness, or control**. These can manifest as shortcuts in our brains that can lead us to make decisions based on assumptions.
    - **Inclusion**: Inclusion is the **active, intentional, and ongoing engagement with diversity**, where each person is valued and provided with the opportunity to participate fully in creating a successful and thriving community. It means creating value from the distinctive skills, experiences, and perspectives of all members of our community.
    - **Accessibility**: A general term for the **degree of ease** that something (e.g., device, service, physical environment, and information) can be accessed, used, and enjoyed by persons with disabilities. The term implies conscious planning, design, and/or effort to make sure something is barrier-free to persons with disabilities. Accessibility also benefits the general population, by making things more usable and practical for everyone, including older people and families with small children.
    - **Anti-Racism**: An active process of **identifying and counteracting racism** by changing systems, organizational structures, policies, practices, and attitudes so that power is redistributed.
    - Some key features about **unconscious biases**:
        - Everyone has them
        - They can be activated within a fraction of a second
        - We can hold biases against our own group
        - We can hold biases that go against our stated beliefs
        - Biases are generally shared within social groups, though people also have biases favouring people who share their identities
        - Biases are persistent, but can be changed with attention and work
    - **Cultural bias** refers to any prejudice, beliefs, or assumptions that we make about another culture, and basing those assumptions and beliefs on our own culture. Cultural bias is different from racism in that **it does not target a particular race** but rather cultural differences or practices. 
    - The most important step to keeping your biases in check is to be aware of them in the first place. Consider the following guidelines: 
        - **Building awareness**: Instead of jumping to conclusions, ask yourself: “why did the client say this? Why did they behave this way?” Do you think certain practices or behaviours are “silly” because they are not in your culture, or because you don’t understand the reasons behind them? Keep an open mind and find out the motivation behind that particular behaviour.
        - **Educate yourself**: Research information that could help you understand different cultures that you may find yourself working with. Consider your own actions or gestures that you feel are normal but may offend a client or a coworker from another background.  
        - **Be patient**: When communicating with clients or colleagues from another background, remember that different cultures have different meanings of words, gestures, and body language. If you are confused or uncertain about how to interpret a gesture or phrase, clarify this with the client or colleague in a respectful manner.
