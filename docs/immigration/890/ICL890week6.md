??? note "Introduction"

    - Immigration, Refugees, and Citizenship Canada, “Procedural fairness” (22 August 2018), [online: Government of Canada/Gouvernement du Canada](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/procedural-fairness.html){:target="\_blank"}.
    - **Cultural competence** is defined as: **the ability to effectively interact with people from cultures different from one’s own, especially through a knowledge and appreciation of cultural differences**.
    - **Equity**: Guarantee of fair treatment, access, opportunity. Goes beyond formal equality; differential treatment according to need may be required.
    - **Diversity**: In broad terms, diversity is any dimension that can be used to differentiate groups and people from one another. It means **respect for and appreciation of differences in ethnicity, gender, age, national origin, ability, sexual orientation, faith, socio-economic status, and class.** But it also includes **differences in life experiences, learning and working styles, and personality types** that can be engaged to achieve excellence.
    - **Indigenization**: Indigenization is a process or action that focusses on **incorporating Indigenous knowledges into approaches in recognition of the value** and importance of including in the university system. An example of this usage is the Indigenization of the curriculum in many of the Queen’s faculties. Indigenization is an action word, and towards this, Queen's is ensuring that Equity, Diversity, Inclusion and Indigenization (EDII) are incorporated into plans across the university.
    - **Unconscious Biases**: Unconscious (or implicit, hidden) biases are **mental processes that operate outside of our consciousness, intentional awareness, or control**. These can manifest as shortcuts in our brains that can lead us to make decisions based on assumptions.
    - **Inclusion**: Inclusion is the **active, intentional, and ongoing engagement with diversity**, where each person is valued and provided with the opportunity to participate fully in creating a successful and thriving community. It means creating value from the distinctive skills, experiences, and perspectives of all members of our community.
    - **Accessibility**: A general term for the **degree of ease** that something (e.g., device, service, physical environment, and information) can be accessed, used, and enjoyed by persons with disabilities. The term implies conscious planning, design, and/or effort to make sure something is barrier-free to persons with disabilities. Accessibility also benefits the general population, by making things more usable and practical for everyone, including older people and families with small children.
    - **Anti-Racism**: An active process of **identifying and counteracting racism** by changing systems, organizational structures, policies, practices, and attitudes so that power is redistributed.
    - Some key features about **unconscious biases**:
        - Everyone has them
        - They can be activated within a fraction of a second
        - We can hold biases against our own group
        - We can hold biases that go against our stated beliefs
        - Biases are generally shared within social groups, though people also have biases favouring people who share their identities
        - Biases are persistent, but can be changed with attention and work
    - **Cultural bias** refers to any prejudice, beliefs, or assumptions that we make about another culture, and basing those assumptions and beliefs on our own culture. Cultural bias is different from racism in that **it does not target a particular race** but rather cultural differences or practices. 
    - The most important step to keeping your biases in check is to be aware of them in the first place. Consider the following guidelines: 
        - **Building awareness**: Instead of jumping to conclusions, ask yourself: “why did the client say this? Why did they behave this way?” Do you think certain practices or behaviours are “silly” because they are not in your culture, or because you don’t understand the reasons behind them? Keep an open mind and find out the motivation behind that particular behaviour.
        - **Educate yourself**: Research information that could help you understand different cultures that you may find yourself working with. Consider your own actions or gestures that you feel are normal but may offend a client or a coworker from another background.  
        - **Be patient**: When communicating with clients or colleagues from another background, remember that different cultures have different meanings of words, gestures, and body language. If you are confused or uncertain about how to interpret a gesture or phrase, clarify this with the client or colleague in a respectful manner.

## Quizzes

??? note "Knowledge Check 6.1: Cultural Competency"

    1. Even though "equity" means to guarantee fair treatment, access, and opportunity, differential treatment according to need may still be required.
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False
    > "Equity" goes beyond formal equality, and depending on circumstances and context, differential treatment may still be required to achieve equity.

    2. What types of actions should you take to ensure that your business is operating "**inclusively**"? Select all that apply.
        - [x] Actively engage with diversity.
        - [x] Valuing and providing individuals in your business with the opportunity to participate in creating success for your business.
        - [x] Create value from distinctive skills, experiences, and perspectives of your employees and others you work with.

    3. RCIC Oona speaks Chinese fluently, as her father was born and raised in Beijing. However, she has never travelled to China herself. Her consulting practice has many Chinese clients, thanks to her father's business network in China. A few weeks ago, her father emailed Oona to say that he wanted to introduce a new client for a consultation. The client is extremely wealthy and is interested in investing a significant amount of capital in a Canadian start-up, which he hoped would allow him to apply for a work permit. Oona was very excited at this prospect and decided to wear a new dress and prepare a greeting gift to make a good first impression. On her way home from work, she saw a handmade and hand-carved clock in a local shop window, which featured 24-karat gold hands. She purchased the clock and had it wrapped up beautifully. However, when the client opened her gift, he became very agitated and left Oona's office without saying goodbye. Oona later learned that the word for "clock" in Chinese has the same pronunciation as "the end," signifying "time running out" or death. How should Oona proceed?
        - [x] Send an email or call the client to apologize for her oversight and explain her perceived ignorance.
        - [ ] Offer the client a reduced retainer fee.
        - [ ] Ask her father to pass on her apologies.
        - [ ] Leave the client alone and do not follow up to exacerbate the bad impression.

    4. RCIC Monique was born in Russia to French-Canadian parents who were diplomats at the Canadian embassy in Moscow. Monique grew up speaking French and English. She was raised by a Russian nanny, who taught her to speak Russian. Monique now lives in Montreal and manages an immigration consulting firm. She specializes in Quebec skilled worker category and has a large Russian client base since she is fluent in Russian. Monique is respectful and diligent in her work, and she rarely receives refusals on her applications. Her Russian clients often ask if they can refer their friends who are interested in applying under the Quebec investor program. In her early 20s, Monique accused her Russian employer of dishonest business tactics and was fired as a result. She dislikes working with Russian businessmen and has avoided taking any such clients since she established her practice. Does Monique have any unconscious or cultural biases?  
        - [x] Yes, Monique has personal bias against Russian businessmen.
        - [ ] Yes, Monique has selection bias against Russian businessmen.
        - [ ] No, Monique does not display any bias as her dislike of Russian businessmen is well-founded.
        - [ ] Yes, Monique has information bias against Russian businessmen. 
    > Monique's **past experience **has led her to generalize negative assumptions about an entire group based on one individual. **This reflects a personal, unconscious bias — even though she may not realize it.** 

    5. Ellie came to you after her spousal sponsorship application was refused. She is a Canadian citizen from the Philippines, and her husband is from Singapore. They met in Canada when he was studying on a Study Permit. He returned to Singapore after his study permit expired. Ellie is 40 years old and her husband, Al, is 29. Ellie has been married before and Al has not been married before. Ellie has 2 children, and Al has no children.  Both belong to the Seventh Day Adventist Church, and both are very active in their churches, Ellie in Canada, and Al in Singapore. Their wedding was performed in a Seventh Day Adventist Church. In the GCMS notes, there is no mention of this connection. The application was refused because the visa officer thought that the couple had too many differences – Al is younger than Ellie, they are from different countries, previous marital status of each one is different, she has children, and he has no children. Has the officer demonstrated bias in failing to consider the shared, and somewhat uncommon, religion of the couple? Select all that apply.
        - [ ] No, the officer is correct to see all the other differences as overwhelming and did not need to consider the shared religion.
        - [x] Yes, the officer demonstrated bias in not asking questions about the shared religion and the importance of the shared religion to each of the parties.
        - [ ] No, the differences in age, country of origin, previous marital status and children are sufficient to overshadow a shared religion.
        - [x] Yes, the officer demonstrated bias in assuming that the couple had too many differences.

    6. "Diversity", as defined by the Human Rights and Equity Office of Queen's University, primarily means to have respect for and appreciation of differences in ethnicity, gender, age, national origin, ability, sexual orientation, faith, socio-economic status, and class.
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False

    7. RCIC Soraya owns a medium-sized immigration consulting firm and employs six assistants, each from a different cultural and linguistic background. She often assigns files based on cultural or language match and tells her team to be “culture blind” and help each other out during busy periods. While her intentions are to reduce communication barriers and prevent burnout, this “culture blind” approach may prevent deeper learning about client needs.

        To foster a more inclusive and culturally competent practice, which of the following strategies would be most effective? Select all “best answers” that apply.

        - [x] Ask each team member to write a self-reflection on their own implicit or cultural biases and how they plan to address them in client work.
        - [x] Hold internal workshops where staff share insights about cultural behaviours, body language, and communication styles from their communities.
        - [ ] Hire a human rights lawyer to draft a "culture map" outlining expectations for each ethnic group the office serves.
        - [ ] Use role play exercises among staff to simulate difficult conversations and allow public critiques to improve awareness.

    > Strategies like self-reflection on bias (A) and peer-led cultural knowledge workshops (B) foster cultural humility, which is more effective than the "culture blind" approach. Recognizing and learning about cultural differences helps prevent miscommunication and builds stronger relationships with clients.

    > Option C is not practical or client-centered, and Option D, while useful in some settings, can be problematic if it involves critiquing colleagues' personal responses, especially without proper facilitation or training.

    8. RCIC Petra is of Polish descent and has been practicing for just over a year. Until now, her clients have primarily shared her cultural background. She recently scheduled a consultation with a Dutch couple interested in applying under the Federal Skilled Worker program. Petra is aware that Dutch communication culture is typically low-context, meaning clients prefer explicit, direct, and unambiguous language. 

        The couple is not currently eligible due to low language test scores. What is the most culturally appropriate and professional way for Petra to communicate this?

        - [x] "Your current scores are unfortunately below the minimum required. To be eligible, you would need to retake the test and meet the minimum threshold." 
        - [ ] "You may want to consider improving your scores to increase your competitiveness in the program." 
        - [ ] "The current scores don't guarantee success, but some clients in the past have been able to proceed despite similar profiles."
        - [ ] "Eligibility varies, and it's hard to say definitively — but working on your language score might help you in the long run."

    9. "Implicit biases" are spoken words that result from your brain's intentional awareness of assumptions that you form while interacting with other cultures.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
    > **Implicit** biases (also known as unconscious biases) are mental processes that operate **outside of our consciousness**, intentional awareness, or control. These can manifest as shortcuts in our brains that can lead us to make decisions based on assumptions.

    10. You are assisting your clients with submitting a sponsorship application. The clients are an inter-cultural couple. The sponsor was born in India but relocated to Iran for her father's job before moving to Canada. She had met and began a relationship with the applicant, an Iranian citizen, before she left Iran. They were married in New Delhi years later. The visa office in Tehran, Iran, refused the application, citing the belief that this was not a genuine marriage, because they did not take part in nikah, the traditional religious ceremony, and the bride and groom did not wear traditional Muslim wedding garments. The visa officer was correct in their assessment that the absence of these culturally significant elements is generally indicative of the marriage not being genuine.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False

    11. According to the video "4 Steps for Busting Unconscious Bias," what are the characteristics that our minds subconsciously use to make judgements about people? Select all the apply.
        - [ ] Salary negotiation and history
        - [x] Societal stereotypes
        - [ ] Speech patterns
        - [x] Cultural context
        - [x] Personal experiences
        - [x] Our own background

    12. According to the article "**Unconscious Bias in the Workplace**," unconscious bias in the workplace has many different types and forms. What are some of them?
        - [ ] Gender bias, preferential bias, experience bias
        - [ ] Gender bias, beauty bias, age bias
        - [x] Gender bias, beauty bias, confirmation bias
        - [ ] Gender bias, strategic bias, knowledge bias
    > In the context of unconscious biases in the workplace, **gender bias** refers to preference towards one gender over another, stemming from certain beliefs on gender roles and stereotypes. **Beauty bias** adversely affects women in the workplace, where attractive women are viewed as less competent than male counterparts, or tall people being spoken to or treated with more authority. **Confirmation bias** occurs when we selectively listen to only information that supports our own opinions or beliefs, as our brain subconsciously ignores negative information that does not align with our line of thinking.

    13. François is an RCIC who manages a practice in rural Quebec. His first language is French. He speaks English with a thick Quebecois French accent. Last week, François received a call from Cristina, a foreign worker who has just moved to his town from Nicaragua. Cristina asks for a consultation to discuss her immigration goals. During the consultation, François realizes that Cristina is struggling with understanding his English due to his accent. Cristina asks if François speaks Spanish, but he does not. François asks Cristina if she understands French, and she also says no. What should François' next best course of action be?
        - [ ] End the consultation at that point and ask if he can send a follow up opinion letter to Cristina with her case strategy, written in English.
        - [x] Offer to place the consultation on hold if Cristina has time and call an interpreter who can interpret for François on speakerphone and restart the consultation.
        - [ ] Decline to take Cristina's case but plan to hire an interpreter to join consultations in the future.
        - [ ] Use translation software online to interpret everything François says, so as not to interrupt the consultation or have Cristina make another trip.

    14. What are some ways you can improve your cultural competency? Select all that apply.
        - [ ] Talk to your local financial institution to find out what kind of bank and investment accounts people from different cultures generally open.
        - [ ] Look at and comment on tweets supporting the #BLM and #metoo movements.
        - [ ] Volunteer at local car dealerships to understand which cultures tend to buy which types of cars.
        - [x] Volunteer at local schools to talk to students and parents from different cultures.
        - [x] Volunteer at local immigration service societies to talk to newcomers from other cultures.
        - [x] Read or watch television documentaries and shows about other cultures.
    > Understanding and improving your cultural competency involves educating yourself about different cultures. This can be done through **volunteer work** or by becoming more **educated by additional reading or watching documentaries** on this topic.

    15. You are assisting a Chinese restaurant owner in applying for a Labour Market Impact Assessment for a xiaolongbao chef. The application was successfully submitted, but during the interview with the officer, the employer was told that his advertisements did not include the requirement to possess a "food safety and sanitary preparation" training certificate. The officer claims that without this certificate, employers cannot guarantee that the applicants will know how to safely prepare raw ingredients, "especially when you're serving raw fish in your restaurant."  Has the officer breached procedural fairness by displaying cultural bias in his decision-making?
        - [ ] No, the officer is simply referencing the consequences of hiring an employee who is not proficient with handling raw ingredients.
        - [ ] No, the officer is correct that without the proper training credentials, applicants cannot be trusted to be proficient in handling raw ingredients.
        - [x] Yes, the officer has demonstrated cultural bias in assuming that Asian restaurants all serve raw fish, and a lack of training certificate is indicative of the applicant's inability to handle raw ingredients.
        - [ ] Yes, the officer has demonstrated implicit bias for believing that applicants must obtain a food safety and sanitary preparation certificate.
