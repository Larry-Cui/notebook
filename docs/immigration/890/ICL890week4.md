??? note "Introduction"

    - **SMART** goals are specific, measurable, achievable, realistic, and time-based. For more information see the following article: MindTools Content Team, "SMART Goals: How to make your goals achievable" (2016), [online](https://www.mindtools.com/pages/article/smart-goals.htm){:target="\_blank"}: *MindTools*.
    - Home office:
        - Pros: Safe, and maybe the new normal; possible tax advantages​; degree of comfort and flexibility​; can be inexpensive​
        - Cons: Requires a lot of discipline​; potential distractions​; important to take it seriously​; privacy/security - clients in your home (Now they know where you live! Yikes!)​; 
        - Home-based offices and the CRA: What do you need to know?
            - [Business-use-of-home expenses](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/businesses/topics/sole-proprietorships-partnerships/report-business-income-expenses/completing-form-t2125/business-use-home-expenses.html){:target="\_blank"}
            - [Home Office Deductions for Self-Employed and Employed Taxpayers](https://turbotax.intuit.ca/tips/home-office-deductions-for-self-employed-and-employed-taxpayers-6388){:target="\_blank"}
    - Rented/leased/owned office:
        - Pros: lends credibility to your business presence​; psychological separation between work and life activities​; can accommodate staff, equipment, material, etc.​; you must be aware of Provincial Health rules for health and safety​
        - Cons: more expensive​; monthly rent​; volume of business should justify the expense​; there may be costs associated with Provincial Health rules​ 
    - Serviced office: 
        - Pros: full-time, part-time or occasional use basis - flexible​; many office/mail services available – professional presence​; pay as you use​; Provincial Health rules may be partially taken care of​
        - Cons: You don’t have complete control​; You may/may not have 24-hour-a-day access​; Management can change things​; Watch out for hidden fees​; You still have to be aware of and enforce Provincial Health rules​
    - Co-working spaces:
        - New
        - May have more services than a serviced office including beer, premium coffee, fruit teas, additional types of administrative/creative assistance, common areas and so on.
        - May give you access to ​several locations
        - May require membership or some kind of longer-term lease arrangement
        - Remember Provincial Health rules
    - In Canada or overseas?
        - Not all RCICs work in Canada
        - Some work abroad – in their country of other nationality or in some other country
        - If you chose to do this, make sure that you familiarize yourself with the CICC Regulations that would pertain to that situation. 
    - **Recruiters** can help with several programs by assisting clients with finding jobs. Be aware of provincial rules regarding who you can represent and who pays you for services. Many new RCICs envision a dual business where they can provide both recruitment and immigration services. While this is not impossible, it can be a very difficult framework to manage as recruitment agencies are licensed and regulated by different government authorities than RCICs. Unless managed carefully, this dual business and “double dipping” of fees may cause a conflict of interest that could result in complicated legal issues that have real potential to cause irreparable damage to the RCIC, the employer, and your client. **Fees for recruitment services can only be paid by employers to licensed recruitment agencies.** It is **illegal** for a recruitment agency and/or an RCIC to demand or collect recruitment fees from a job seeker. Recruitment agencies and/or RCICs are also prohibited from demanding or holding a bond from a job seeker, even if there is a promise to refund the fee. Recruitment agencies and/or RCICs cannot direct an employer to recover costs for recruitment fees from a job seeker.

## Quizzes

??? note "Knowledge Check 4.1: Practicing as an Immigration Consultant"

    1. Which of the following core elements are related to sole proprietorship business models? (Choose all that apply).
        - [ ] Strategic decision making is shared with others
        - [x] Business income is declared as personal income
        - [x] Business ownership is registered under your name
        - [ ] You can operate a business name throughout Canada
    > In a sole proprietorship, you alone make all strategic decisions and assume full responsibility for the business. Business income is declared as personal income on your tax return, and ownership is registered under your name, or a trade name if you choose to register one provincially. 
    > While you can register a business name in your province or territory, **federal name registration (allowing operation across Canada) is associated with federally incorporated companies, not sole proprietorships**.

    2. Amelia and Ranjeet grew up in the same neighbourhood and attended the same elementary school. They attended different high schools and colleges but met each other again when they both enrolled in the Graduate Diploma in Immigration and Citizenship Law. They discovered that Amelia did really well during their Family Class course, and Ranjeet did well during Economic Class. After they finish the program, Ranjeet asks Amelia to consider forming a partnership with her and starting a business together. What are some key elements of a partnership that Ranjeet should mention to Amelia? 
        - [ ] They can register a business name throughout Canada of their own choosing, and they can declare their business income as personal income.
        - [ ] Their partnership can be operated as a distinct legal entity from their personal assets and liabilities, and they can register their business name throughout Canada.
        - [x] Their business income can be declared as personal income, they are jointly responsible for liabilities and assets of the business, and they share strategic decision-making responsibilities.
        - [ ] They can share in strategic decision-making responsibilities, and they can operate a distinct legal entity from their personal assets and liabilities. 
    > **In a general partnership, the business is not a separate legal entity from the partners.** This means each partner is personally liable for the debts and obligations of the business, even those incurred by the other partner. Business income is reported as personal income on each partner's tax return, and partners typically share decision-making responsibilities. While partnerships can register a business name across provinces, this does not provide legal separation or limit liability. **For limited liability, a different structure such as an LLP or corporation would be required.**

    3. Roberta has just been issued her license to practice as an RCIC by the regulator. Prior to graduating from the GDipICL program, she earned a bachelor's degree in International Relations. She has decided to work as a specialist and work exclusively with international students, since her sister works with a local public university. She has decided to establish a home-based business. Which of the following services can Roberta claim as **expenses** in her home-based business?  
        - [ ] The costs of buying a new desk and ergonomic computer chair as part of her office set-up
        - [x] Her entire retainer fee from retaining a law firm to help her incorporate her company
        - [ ] The costs of buying filing cabinets to store her client files
        - [ ] Her entire mortgage interest payment each year
    > Legal and accounting fees related to setting up the business are generally fully deductible as business expenses. 
    > However, mortgage interest can only be partially claimed based on the percentage of the home used for business. 
    > Items like filing cabinets, desks, and chairs are considered **capital assets**, not current expenses. While they cannot be fully deducted in the year of purchase, they can be claimed over time through Capital Cost Allowance (CCA). 
    > It's important for RCICs with home-based businesses to track expenses carefully and consult CRA guidelines to remain compliant. 

    4. RCIC Wilson has been working as an Assistant Immigration Consultant for several years. This year, he finally made the decision to open his own practice. He has invited two of his former classmates, Emily and Julie, to join his new business as his partners. Wilson is experienced in all types of Economic Class applications. Emily and Julie are both knowledgeable in Temporary Residence and LMIA applications. Based on their respective knowledge and experience, how should Wilson structure the scope of his practice in order to best serve his clients? 
        - [ ] As a specialist in Economic Class applications, to maximize clientele and profit 
        - [ ] As a generalist by signing co-counsel agreements with other experienced practitioners
        - [x] As a specialist in Economic Class, Temporary Residence, and LMIA applications
        - [ ] As a generalist by purchasing recordings from past CPD events to learn about other programs
    > Since Wilson, Emily, and Julie each bring specific experience in particular areas, **they should structure their practice to reflect their combined strengths.** Marketing themselves as specialists in these areas is both accurate and ethical. 
    > They should avoid representing themselves as generalists until they have gained sufficient, demonstrable experience across additional immigration categories. Practising within their scope of competence ensures high-quality service to clients and aligns with the Code of Professional Conduct.

    5. RCIC Brianna has been practising since 2020. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, she has not been able to attend many Continuing Professional Development activities in person. For this reason, she does not know many experienced or senior practitioners and has instead been calling the IRCC Client Service Centre a lot to obtain information from call centre agents. Brianna has just been retained by a new client to submit a Work Permit application under the CUSMA Professionals program. She has never completed such an application before, but she has read all the program guides available on the topic. This is not sufficient under the Code of Professional Conduct, and Brianna is obligated to retain the services of a third-party representative to assist her in submitting this application.

Hubert has decided to start an immigration consulting practice to help other hairstylists in the province with work permits and permanent residence.

For over ten years, she was employed by Amazon as a Technical Recruiter, responsible for hiring and staffing highly skilled Software and Computer Engineers to work in Amazon offices around the world. She has just completed her Graduate Diploma in Immigration and Citizenship Law. She has decided to focus on corporate clients, specializing in assisting Canadian employers in the technology sector fulfill their labour market needs by applying for work permits and Labour Market Impact Assessments. Lydia owns a primary residence in the United States and a vacation home in Canada. In order to fulfill her obligations to her clients, Lydia should open an office in Canada so her clients will be able to sign their documents in person.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False

    10. RCIC Farah plans to expand her immigration consulting business by working with several overseas education agents. She signs agreements with three agents and begins working with them immediately, helping them connect international students to Canadian programs and receiving client referrals. Farah intends to register them with the College later in the year once she has finalized her internal procedures. Based on the Agents Regulation, what must Farah do before working with these agents?
        - [ ] Farah may proceed with the agreements but must notify the Council only if the agents begin charging clients.
        - [ ] Farah may work with the agents immediately as long as she registers them with the College within 90 days.

    12. RCIC Aaron speaks Spanish fluently, having grown up in Argentina and being educated in Spain. All of Aaron's clients are from Spanish-speaking countries, and their documents are provided in Spanish. He is required to retain the services of a third-party translator to translate these documents into English. However, because Aaron is fluent in Spanish, he decides to translate his clients' documents into English himself and save his clients some money. Aaron pays a certified translator a small fee to insert her translator's credentials and stamp on the documents when he is finished translating the documents himself.  Should Aaron continue to do this?
        - [ ] No, doing so is illegal, and Aaron can be arrested or charged with providing fraudulent documentation.
        - [ ] Yes, Aaron does not strictly require the services of a third-party translator because he is fluent in Spanish himself.
        - [x] No, Aaron must fully retain the services of a certified third-party translator, or he may be **breaching his "Delivery of quality services" from the Code of Professional Conduct.**
        - [ ] No, doing so is in direct conflict of interest between Aaron and the third-party translator.
