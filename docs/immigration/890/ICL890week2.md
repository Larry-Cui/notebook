    - Chantal Desloges & Cathryn Sawicki, Chapter 9 Parts IV and V, "Request for PR on H&C Grounds" and "Decisions on Humanitarian and Compassionate Applications" in *Canadian Immigration and Refugee Law: A practitioner's handbook*, 4th ed (Toronto, ON: Emond).
    - Arlene Blatt & JoAnn Kurtz, Chapter 15, Appendix 15.1, "Legal Writing" in *Legal Research: Step by step*, 5th ed (Toronto, ON: Emond, 2020).

??? note "Introduction"

    - In this unit, we revisit the **CREAC** framework for persuasive legal writing. The letters in the **CREAC** acronym stand for: **Conclusion**, **Rule** (or law), **Explanation**, **Application**, and **Conclusion**.
    - As you'll recall, one of the most powerful pieces of evidence included with an **H&C application** is the applicant's **affidavit**. An affidavit is sworn testimony presented in writing. In an affidavit, the client tells their story in their own words. They describe the relevant situations and experiences that have led them to this application. But even the affidavit - evidence itself - may require **additional supporting evidence** such as birth and marriage certificates, medical records, and letters of support that corroborate the events described or asserted.
    - In more complex submissions, however, your CREAC structure might be more flexible, even though it is still discernible. For example, you may wish to **present detailed background information** about your client.

??? note "CREAC examples"

    - **Mei Lin's Case:** Your client Mei Lin Wong is a 29-year-old permanent resident of Canada, originally from Malaysia. She immigrated to Canada with her family in 2013. Mei Lin received her first permanent resident (PR) card on **September 15, 2014**. The last time she renewed her PR card was five years ago. Over the past decade, Mei Lin has maintained continuous residence in Canada, only occasionally leaving for short trips to visit family in Malaysia and for work-related conferences in the United States.  As September 2024 approaches, Mei Lin realized that her current PR card is nearing its expiry date. Knowing the importance of maintaining valid documentation, Mei Lin has come to you and asked whether she is likely to be able to renew her card based on the forgoing information. **Issue**: Whether Mei Lin is eligible to renew her PR card.
        - Based on the facts provided, Mei Lin is likely able to renew her PR card. 
        - The *Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations*  (SOR/2002-227) subsection 54(1) [IRPR] establishes that PR cards are valid for 5 years from date of issue. In order to renew a PR card, the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act*, SC 2001, c 27 [IRPA] paragraph 28(2)(a) requires 730 days of physical presence in Canada over 5 years.
        - [In this case, since the legislative rule is specific, clear, and unambiguous, no Explanation is required - the legislation speaks for itself.]
        - Mei Lin received her first PR card on September 15, 2014, and renewed her status five years ago, making her eligible for renewal once again as she approaches the ten-year mark (IRPA s 54(1)). Mei Lin indicates that she has maintained continuous residence in Canada, only leaving for occasional short trips. This suggests she has likely met the residency obligation of 730 days of physical presence in Canada over the past five years, as required by IRPA s 28(2)(a). 
        - Therefore, in light of Mei Lin's timely application and her apparent compliance with residency requirements, she is likely to be successful in renewing her permanent residence card, assuming she can provide the documentary evidence required under the Act and that no disqualifying factors are present. 
    - **Analogic reasoning:** Analogic reasoning means drawing an analogy between an authority, usually a case with similar facts and legal issues, and your client’s situation. This form of reasoning leverages the principle of ***stare decisis***: **cases that involve similar facts and the same legal issues should be decided the same way**.
    - **Michael and Lucia's Case:** Michael Chen has retained you to help him with a family class sponsorship. Michael is a 29-year-old Canadian citizen and is seeking to sponsor his wife, Lucia Gonzalez, a 27-year-old citizen of Mexico, for permanent residence in Canada under the spousal sponsorship program. **Issue**: Whether Michael and Lucia's marriage can be considered genuine in spite of the short time they have spent together. 
        - Despite the short period of in-person interaction before and after marriage, Michael and Lucia's marriage is nonetheless genuine for immigration purposes.
        - Section 4(1) of the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations* SOR/2002-227 states that a foreign national shall not be considered a spouse if the marriage is not genuine or was entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring status or privilege under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act SC 2001, c 27. 
        - However, in assessing the genuineness of a marriage, there are a wide variety of factors to be taken into account. For example, the court in ***Leroux v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***, 2007 FC 403, relied on the Supreme Court of Canada's reasoning in ***M v H***, [1999] 2 SCR 3, where **seven non-exhaustive factors were identified for assessing the genuineness of a marriage**. Further, the court in ***Leroux*** noted that these criteria “must be applied flexibly” (at para 37) since they were established for couples living in Canada and should be modified for couples living in different countries (at para 23). Similarly, in ***Ollivierre v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***, 2018 CanLII 102041 (CA IRB), the IAD emphasized that "In assessing the genuineness of a relationship, the panel must draw conclusions based on the evidence as a whole, rather than focusing on a microscopic view or on only certain aspects of the evidence" [at para 48]. 
        - In the case of ***Sandhu v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***, 2014 FC 1061, the parties were similarly separated by geography after marriage, but kept in regular contact through calls and online messages; they also shared a bank account. The visa officer rejected the spousal sponsorship application and this was upheld by the IAD. The Federal Court however set aside the IAD's decision, noting that the Board should not have ignored "the extensive phone records over the past five years showing daily calls between the Applicant and her husband, of the greeting cards and letters sent to each other, and of a shared bank account showing financial interdependence."
        - While Michael and Lucia have spent limited time together, this factor alone is not determinative. As in ***Sandhu***, where the court accepted a marriage as genuine despite limited co-habitation, Michael and Lucia's consistent online communication and financial connection are evidence of a genuine marriage. Michael's return to Canada, explained by work obligations, mirrors situations where courts have recognized that genuine couples may live apart due to compelling personal circumstances.  Any assessment of their relationship must take into account factors such as joint finances, shared goals, and the frequency and substance of the ongoing communication, rather than focusing solely on geographic co-location.
        - Taking a holistic view of the evidence provided in relation to Michael and Lucia's relationship, it should be concluded that this is a genuine marriage for the purposes of the IRPR. 
    - **Policy-based reasoning:** This example deals with an application for permanent residence based on humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) grounds. The law in this area is heavily influenced by government policy. Although there is extensive case law that offers insight as to how decision makers should weight these factors, the factors themselves are set out at the first instance in policy documents - Operational Guidelines and processing manuals - provided by the IRCC. 
    - **Amina's Case:** Amina Farooqi, a 38-year-old citizen of Pakistan, has been living in Canada without status for seven years. Amina has now come to you and wants to apply for permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate (H&C) grounds. **Issue**: Whether the Minister should exercise their discretion to exempt Amina from requirements of the Act and grant her permanent residence. 
        - The best interests of the children affected by this application strongly support granting Amina Farooqi's application for permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate (H&amp;C) grounds.
        - Section 25(1) of the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Act* requires that in any H&C decision, the best interests of a child directly affected by the application must be taken into account. The Supreme Court of Canada confirmed this in the leading case of ***Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)***, [1999] 2 SCR 817, where it emphasized that the best interests of any child affected by the application are a significant factor that must be given substantial weight in H&C decisions.
        - In ***Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)***, [1999] 2 SCR 817, the Supreme Court relied on the UN Declaration of the Rights of the Child and the Convention on the Rights of the Child to find that "the decision-maker should consider children’s best interests as an important factor, give them substantial weight, and be alert, alive and sensitive to them. ...[W]here the interests of children are minimized, in a manner inconsistent with Canada’s humanitarian and compassionate tradition and the Minister’s guidelines, the decision will be unreasonable" (at **para 75**). Based on ***Baker*** and on other relevant jurisprudence, Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) has identified a set of essential factors in assessing cases involving children **[you would cite the relevant policy document here]**. These include the child's age, level of dependency, educational needs, linguistic and cultural connections, and the potential impact of uprooting the child from their current environment. 
        - In this case, there are three children directly affected by Amina's application: her 12-year-old Canadian-born daughter Zara, and her late sister's children (aged 14 and 16). All three children are Canadian Citizens by birth. None have ever been to Pakistan. Zara speaks only English. Uprooting her from her school life and community would disrupt the education and social connections that are key to her continued healthy development. For Amina's niece and nephew, who have already lost their mother, Amina's potential removal would mean losing their primary caregiver, potentially causing further emotional trauma. All three children have established lives in Canada, including educational and extracurricular activities and friendships that contribute to their well-being. Separating these children from Amina or forcing them to leave Canada would likely cause significant hardship and negatively impact their emotional, social, and educational development.
        - Given the significant negative impact that denying Amina's H&C application would have on the well-being and development of the three minor children affected by this application, the best interests of these children strongly favour granting Amina permanent resident status in Canada.
