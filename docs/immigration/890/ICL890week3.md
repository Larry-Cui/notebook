??? note "Introduction"

    - The profession of Immigration Consultants is regulated by the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants (**CICC**). To become a licensee of the CICC, known as Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultants (**RCIC**), and work as an authorized immigration representative, you must first meet entrance requirements including writing the **Entry to Practice Exam (EPE)** and obtaining a **license**. To maintain your license throughout your career, you must also continue to meet professional development and other license duties. We will discuss these commitments in this course. 
    - IRBC v Mumtaz Khan (01 February 2021) ICCRC 03 File No. VB8-01910 ([Discipline Committee Decision and Reasons](https://irb.gc.ca/en/decisions/Pages/mumtaz-khan.aspx){:target="\_blank"}).
    - *Read R. v Codina* #6, [2017 ONSC 7648](https://canlii.ca/t/hphww)
        - This history sets the stage for the hearing in R. v. Codina #6, which specifically addresses the interpretation of **ss. 91(1) and 126 of the IRPA** and the motion for a directed verdict
    - Complaints can come to CICC from:
        - clients
        - other members of the public
        - Other CICC members
        - IRCC, CBSA, RCMP
        - From CICC itself
    - The **Discipline Process**
        - Once a complaint comes in to CICC, a **preliminary review** will be done to determine if any further investigation of the complaint is warranted.
        - If so, then an **investigation** may be undertaken to get both sides of the story.
        - If it is determined that the complaint has merit it will be passed to the **Complaints committee** for their **review**.
        - If the Complaints committee finds that the member is guilty of an offence, they will pass the matter to the **discipline committee** for a **penalty** determination.
    - The History of Regulated Immigration Consultants
        - The profession was first governed by the Canadian Society of Immigration Consultants (**CSIC**), created in **2004**. 
        - Since **2011**, the profession has been governed by the Immigration Consultants of Canada Regulatory Council (**ICCRC**), which has recently changed to the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants  (**CICC**).
        - The College of [***Immigration and Citizenship Consultants Act***](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-33.6/){:target="\_blank"} was passed by Parliament on June 20, **2019**. The Act created the “College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants,” meant to be the new designated regulator for Immigration Consultants in Canada. 
    - Professional **Self-Regulation**
        - In Canada, most professions are regulated by provincial authorities, and only a few with federal authorities like CICC.
        - The concept of self-regulation is based on the model where a professional group enters into an agreement with the government to regulate the activities of its members, guided by **public interest**.
        - There are several mechanisms that governments have introduced to keep professional regulatory bodies honest: **ministerial accountability**, increasing the number of **government appointed members on councils and boards**, and introducing **agencies** that have oversight over some aspects of the operations of the professional regulatory bodies.
    - There are three levels of regulation:
        - **Registration**: The least involved form of regulation is Registration, where members only need to be listed on a designated “registry.” A good example would be “**Commissioners for Taking Oaths or Affidavits**,” who are duly registered with their province but are not required to receive certification from a particular vocational program.
        - **Certification** is effectively the stamp of approval given to an individual for meeting pre-determined requirements. Certification is often associated with the exclusive use of a title or professional designation (“protection of title”). An example would be the title “**Engineer-in-Training**” (EIT), which refers to Engineering graduates who have been certified to begin working officially as Engineers-in-Training under Professional Engineers.
        - **Licensure** is one of the most restrictive forms of professional regulation, because it provides a professional group with exclusive control over who can practice a profession. Only those individuals who have met specific requirements to enter a profession are issued a “licence” to practice the profession or to perform certain “controlled acts.” 
    - While the regulatory body may provide benefits to its members, its paramount purpose is to provide consumer protection.
    - The primary purpose behind all regulatory body activity is to ensure the **effective provision and access to professional services**, **not** to forward the interests of the profession and its members.
    - By law, the CICC has **no legal authority** to investigate, impose sanctions upon, or seek judicial enforcement against **non-RCICs**, as these individuals are not members and therefore not under the jurisdiction of the regulator. Only the **CBSA** and **RCMP** have the legal authority to investigate and prosecute individuals who are not Authorized Representatives as defined by s 91(2) of IRPA.
    - The **CICC**, as a professional **regulator**, acts to oversee the practices of Canadian immigration consultants. The CICC can be thought of as the “the enforcer” and/or “police” of the profession, because its role is to protect the public’s interests. On the other hand, a **professional association**’s role is to **serve** the interests of its members.
