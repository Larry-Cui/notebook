???+ note "Introduction"

    - The profession of Immigration Consultants is regulated by the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants (**CICC**). To become a licensee of the CICC, known as Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultants (**RCIC**), and work as an authorized immigration representative, you must first meet entrance requirements including writing the **Entry to Practice Exam (EPE)** and obtaining a **license**. To maintain your license throughout your career, you must also continue to meet professional development and other license duties. We will discuss these commitments in this course. 
    - IRBC v Mumtaz Khan (01 February 2021) ICCRC 03 File No. VB8-01910 ([Discipline Committee Decision and Reasons](https://irb.gc.ca/en/decisions/Pages/mumtaz-khan.aspx){:target="\_blank"}).
    - *Read R. v Codina* #6, [2017 ONSC 7648](https://canlii.ca/t/hphww)
        - This history sets the stage for the hearing in R. v. Codina #6, which specifically addresses the interpretation of **ss. 91(1) and 126 of the IRPA** and the motion for a directed verdict
    - Complaints can come to CICC from:
        - clients
        - other members of the public
        - Other CICC members
        - IRCC, CBSA, RCMP
        - From CICC itself
    - The **Discipline Process**
        - Once a complaint comes in to CICC, a **preliminary review** will be done to determine if any further investigation of the complaint is warranted.
        - If so, then an **investigation** may be undertaken to get both sides of the story.
        - If it is determined that the complaint has merit it will be passed to the **Complaints committee** for their **review**.
        - If the Complaints committee finds that the member is guilty of an offence, they will pass the matter to the **discipline committee** for a **penalty** determination.
