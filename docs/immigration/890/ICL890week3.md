??? note "Introduction"

    - The profession of Immigration Consultants is regulated by the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants (**CICC**). To become a licensee of the CICC, known as Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultants (**RCIC**), and work as an authorized immigration representative, you must first meet entrance requirements including writing the **Entry to Practice Exam (EPE)** and obtaining a **license**. To maintain your license throughout your career, you must also continue to meet professional development and other license duties. We will discuss these commitments in this course. 
    - IRBC v Mumtaz Khan (01 February 2021) ICCRC 03 File No. VB8-01910 ([Discipline Committee Decision and Reasons](https://irb.gc.ca/en/decisions/Pages/mumtaz-khan.aspx){:target="\_blank"}).
    - *Read R. v Codina* #6, [2017 ONSC 7648](https://canlii.ca/t/hphww)
        - This history sets the stage for the hearing in R. v. Codina #6, which specifically addresses the interpretation of **ss. 91(1) and 126 of the IRPA** and the motion for a directed verdict
    - Complaints can come to CICC from:
        - clients
        - other members of the public
        - Other CICC members
        - IRCC, CBSA, RCMP
        - From CICC itself
    - The **Discipline Process**
        - Once a complaint comes in to CICC, a **preliminary review** will be done to determine if any further investigation of the complaint is warranted.
        - If so, then an **investigation** may be undertaken to get both sides of the story.
        - If it is determined that the complaint has merit it will be passed to the **Complaints committee** for their **review**.
        - If the Complaints committee finds that the member is guilty of an offence, they will pass the matter to the **discipline committee** for a **penalty** determination.
    - The History of Regulated Immigration Consultants
        - The profession was first governed by the Canadian Society of Immigration Consultants (**CSIC**), created in **2004**. 
        - Since **2011**, the profession has been governed by the Immigration Consultants of Canada Regulatory Council (**ICCRC**), which has recently changed to the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants  (**CICC**).
        - The College of [***Immigration and Citizenship Consultants Act***](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-33.6/){:target="\_blank"} was passed by Parliament on June 20, **2019**. The Act created the “College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants,” meant to be the new designated regulator for Immigration Consultants in Canada. 
    - Professional **Self-Regulation**
        - In Canada, most professions are regulated by provincial authorities, and only a few with federal authorities like CICC.
        - The concept of self-regulation is based on the model where a professional group enters into an agreement with the government to regulate the activities of its members, guided by **public interest**.
        - There are several mechanisms that governments have introduced to keep professional regulatory bodies honest: **ministerial accountability**, increasing the number of **government appointed members on councils and boards**, and introducing **agencies** that have oversight over some aspects of the operations of the professional regulatory bodies.
    - There are three levels of regulation:
        - **Registration**: The least involved form of regulation is Registration, where members only need to be listed on a designated “registry.” A good example would be “**Commissioners for Taking Oaths or Affidavits**,” who are duly registered with their province but are not required to receive certification from a particular vocational program.
        - **Certification** is effectively the stamp of approval given to an individual for meeting pre-determined requirements. Certification is often associated with the exclusive use of a title or professional designation (“protection of title”). An example would be the title “**Engineer-in-Training**” (EIT), which refers to Engineering graduates who have been certified to begin working officially as Engineers-in-Training under Professional Engineers.
        - **Licensure** is one of the most restrictive forms of professional regulation, because it provides a professional group with exclusive control over who can practice a profession. Only those individuals who have met specific requirements to enter a profession are issued a “licence” to practice the profession or to perform certain “controlled acts.” 
    - While the regulatory body may provide benefits to its members, its paramount purpose is to provide consumer protection.
    - The primary purpose behind all regulatory body activity is to ensure the **effective provision and access to professional services**, **not** to forward the interests of the profession and its members.
    - By law, the CICC has **no legal authority** to investigate, impose sanctions upon, or seek judicial enforcement against **non-RCICs**, as these individuals are not members and therefore not under the jurisdiction of the regulator. Only the **CBSA** and **RCMP** have the legal authority to investigate and prosecute individuals who are not Authorized Representatives as defined by s 91(2) of IRPA.
    - The **CICC**, as a professional **regulator**, acts to oversee the practices of Canadian immigration consultants. The CICC can be thought of as the “the enforcer” and/or “police” of the profession, because its role is to protect the public’s interests. On the other hand, a **professional association**’s role is to **serve** the interests of its members.

??? note "Continuing Professional Development"

    - All licensees of the CICC must complete **16 hours** of Continuing Professional Development (CPD) requirements each year (July 1 to June 30).
    - Eligible Activities include: 
        - (a) Participating in approved CPD Courses or Programs, including: Attending in-person or online, live CPD Courses or Programs that provide an opportunity to interact with colleagues and/or instructors; Reviewing a recorded CPD Course or Program and summarizing the learnings from the Approved CPD Activity; Participating in asynchronous, online CPD Courses that prompt responses throughout the learning process, such as requiring participants to respond to questions before they can move to the next module or section; and/or Participating in conference sessions, seminars, workshops, etc.; 
        - (b) Participating in a post-secondary educational institution Course or Program; 
        - (c) Teaching, including: At a post-secondary education Program accredited by the Council; Facilitating a CPD Activity for an approved CPD Provider; Facilitating a session, workshop, or seminar at an approved conference; and/or Facilitating approved group case study discussions; 
        - (d) Writing a book or article for publication, based on Approved Subject Matter, with or without a co-author, where the content aligns to the Essential Competencies for RCICs and Canadian immigration and citizenship consultancy; 
        - (e) Acting as a mentor through the Council’s Mentoring Program; 
        - (f) Participating in Activities related to the observation of proceedings before a tribunal or court with the exception of licensees who are completing, or have completed, the Specialization Program where observing tribunal proceedings is a mandatory requirement; and 
        - (g) Participating in group case study discussions which, to be approved, must meet the following parameters: More than one (1) RCIC must be present; Groups cannot exceed fifteen (15) participants; and File-specific discussions are not eligible.
    - Licensees of CICC who are **on approved leave** from the profession, as well as suspended licensees, are still required to earn CPD hours during their leave.
    - CPD hours may be **carried over** to the next calendar, up to a maximum of **six hours**.
    - A CPD provider is an organization that offers continuing professional development events and activities to  licensees of CICC and may include non-profit organizations, government agencies, provincially accredited institutions, or other recognized regulatory bodies. **Professional associations** are the main provider of continuing professional development opportunities.
    - College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants, "Compliance Audit Regulation (UPDATED)," (17 November 2021).
    - As regulated Canadian immigration consultants, we are required to comply with the Code of Professional Conduct and all the regulations. We must be prepared to complete an annual audit.
    - **Errors and Omissions (E & O) insurance** is a type of professional liability insurance that protects regulated professionals against claims of inadequate work or negligent actions. This type of insurance usually covers both court costs and any settlements up to a specific amount. 
    - All immigration consultants are required to carry E & O insurance. The E & O insurance may be purchased annually through a provider identified by the CICC and is reasonably priced. The insurance through the CICC-approved E & O provider has **a collective amount of maximum coverage** to include all participating licencees.
    - For more information about the CICC-approved provider, visit the website for [Smith Petrie Carr & Scott Insurance Brokers Ltd](https://www.spcs-ins.com/cicc-ccic-errors-and-omissions-coverage/){:target="\_blank"}.



??? note "CICC Complaints and Discipline Process"

    - The CICC accepts and investigates complaints against licensees in two ways:
        - A member of the **public** or a **licensee** of the CICC may submit a complaint through the CICC Complaints Portal or by submitting a fully completed and signed complaint form.
        - A complaint or credible claim that a licensee of CICC has committed an offence under the Code of Professional Conduct may be submitted by a federal, provincial, or municipal **government department or agency**, or by **police** or **a law enforcement agency**.
    - Stage 1: Complaints may **not be made anonymously**. CICC can only properly investigate a complaint and determine whether **there is merit in the complaint** if the complainant submits a copy of their government-issued identification. The CICC licensee who is the subject of the complaint will be given a full and fair opportunity to respond to the complaint. The regulator will work with the licensee to ensure that personal information and privacy are maintained. If consent is provided by the licensee, the CICC may share the complaint information with government authorities, including the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP), the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA), and the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA).
    - Stage 2: CICC will carefully **review the complaint**. They will first determine whether the complaint is against a licensed or registered member of CICC, or if they are licensed as a lawyer or paralegal, or they are an unauthorized representative.
    - Stage 3: Based on CICC’s review and assessment, the complaint could be **closed without action**, **referred to the Voluntary Resolution Program**, or **referred to Investigations**. In every case, the Complainant will be given an acknowledgment of the complaint and file number and will also be apprised of the stages of the review and assessment process.
    - CICC can **decline** to investigate a complaint if the issues involved are so minor that it would be unfair and unreasonable to take any action, or if it has been found that the complaint was made frivolously and without merit, and it is not in the public’s interest to proceed further. The complaints process typically takes several months to resolve.
    - There are several possible actions that the Discipline Committee may recommend upon concluding that the complaint is justified and the licensee is guilty of an offence. Some disciplinary actions include:
        - Issuing a **reprimand**, which may be published on the CICC’s website
        - **Suspending** the offender’s license for a certain period
        - Imposing **restrictions** on the right of the licensees’s **firm** to practice
        - **Revoking** the offender’s license
        - Making any **other orders** necessary
    - CICC can discipline current and formerly registered licensees of CICC. However, it has no authority to regulate lawyers, paralegals, notaires du chambres du Quebec, or unauthorized representatives.

With their help, she has slowly built a solid practice through study permit applications.
