# Module 8 - Client Documentation

## Notes

??? note "Tutorial notes"

    - Thursday 4:00pm.

??? note "Client Documentation - The process of receiving and reviewing"

    - Send the client a document checklist. 
        - You can request the client to upload their documents to a shared cloud storage folder, such as Google Drive or Dropbox, and then share the access link with you, or they can email you the documents as they are prepared.
    - Download, rename and organize all documents. 
        - Documents may come to you in different formats and using different file naming conventions. To ensure that your client's files are well-organized, secure, and easy to find for you and your staff (if applicable), rename any electronic documents you receive and save them according to your file management system. Some ideas for file names could be "Surname-Passport.pdf", "Surname-IELTS.pdf", etc.
        - When using the Permanent Residence Portal, recommended document labelling is as follows: "Last Name - First Name – Document type - #" For example: "Wong - John - Proof of Education -1."
    - Review all documentation. 
        - The document is still **valid**. Remember that language test results are valid for two years, Education Credential Assessments (ECAs) are valid for 5 years, and police clearance certificates may only be valid for 6 months, depending on the current place of residence of the client. Medical examinations are only valid for one year after the exam.
        - The most recent **version** of government-issued forms has been used. IRCC forms change often and without notice. If old forms are submitted, this can lead to the return of an application.
        - The document is in the correct **format** and there are no unreadable sections. IRCC requires that all scanned police clearance certificates be made available in colour. ECAs should be issued for “immigration purposes” only and not for “not recognized” institutions.
        - Proof of employment, or employment reference letters, include all **mandatory elements and content** required by IRCC.
        - The client has the requisite amount of **funds** necessary for their type of application.
    - Follow up on missing, incomplete, and/or incorrect documents.
        - Advise the client immediately if any of their documents is missing or incomplete, is not in the correct format, or if the information is incorrect. At this early stage of the process, the client would have sufficient time to obtain replacements or make revisions.

??? note "Client Personal History Collection"

    - To successfully complete your client’s application forms, the client will usually need to provide you with their full personal history for the **past 10 years**, or **since they turned 18 years of age**. 
    - The client personal history questionnaire should include the following elements:
        - Aliases or past names
        - Current and previous marriages
        - Former countries of residence
        - Education history
        - Employment and unemployment history
        - Military service periods
        - Statutory background declaration questions
        - Previous applications to Canada
    - Other information that may be required on different types of applications, such as **travel history**, **address history**, or **relationship details** (for a sponsorship application), can be added and made into different versions of the questionnaire.
    - Following is a list of documents that clients may need to provide in support of their personal history:
        - Police clearance certificates
        - Proof of work experience
        - Proof of funds
        - Evidence of common law relationship
            - Proof of cohabitation can include **joint bank statements** or **credit card** and **utility statements** in each of their names, showing the same address. **Government-issued identification cards showing the same address** are also acceptable. For more details on which documents are accepted for common law partners, refer back to your Family Class course.
        - Other civil status documents
            - Birth certificates or adoption certificates will be required from all applicants and accompanying dependents.
        - Proof of studies
        - digital photos

??? note "Interviews with IRCC visa office"

    - There are several possible reasons a client will be invited for an interview. The person reviewing the file, who is unlikely to be the decision-maker, may have **concerns** about some aspect of the application such as the veracity of information, timelines, or inconsistencies. On the other hand, the file may have been selected for a **Quality Assurance** interview and there are no issues of note on the file. The GCMS notes should give some indication of the purpose of the interview.
    - If your client is unable to attend an interview, you must **notify IRCC** as early as possible through their web form. You will need to provide reasonable justification as to why your client is unable to attend. If you fail to notify IRCC, your client’s application may be closed or refused, and the client will have to apply again.
    - It is **unlikely** that counsel or a sponsor will be allowed to **attend** most interviews between the client and Canadian authorities; however, this does not mean that counsel cannot request to attend.
    - **Start with baseline questions.** The interview will typically begin with a baseline set of questions that the visa officer knows will be answered truthfully. 
    - **Speak slowly.** 
    - **Listen closely to the question and respond to the answer directly.** it is important that their answers are direct and to the point, without too many unnecessary details. 
    - **Do not guess the answer to a question.** Responding with “I do not remember” or “**I cannot recall at this time**,” is the appropriate answer when the client cannot remember. Guessing an answer or making up an answer will end up damaging your client’s credibility with the visa officer.    
    - **Arrange for an interpreter early.**
    - **Bring copies of all documents requested.**
    - The structure of the interview will likely be something like the following:
        - **Verification** of baseline information such as identity, age, address, etc. These questions are specifically asked to help put the applicant at ease since they know the answers to these questions.
        - **Review** of original documents and **verify** copies of originals.
        - Confirmation that the applicant meets the **eligibility** of the application. Often open questions will be asked during this part of the interview.
        - Addressing particular **concerns** of the interview such as third-party information, misrepresentation, etc.

??? note "Interviews at a Port of Entry – CBSA Examinations"

    - Every person who enters Canada is subject to an examination by a Border Service Officer from the Canada Border Services Agency (CBSA). These examinations may be quick, taking 2 to 5 minutes, or can be quite lengthy, taking several hours. 
    - In an interview at a port of entry, the clients must be **truthful** in their responses to questions posed by a CBSA officer.
    - If CBSA feels that extra examination is necessary, they will require the client to remain at the port of entry to conduct secondary screening procedures. This is normally referred to as being “**sent to Secondary**”.
    - CBSA has the authority to **examine all information** including email accounts, text messages, and even social media accounts such as Facebook. They can legally demand that the client provide any passwords to open these accounts. The client has no right to legal counsel while undergoing an examination at the port of entry unless they are formally detained.

## Quizzes

??? note "Knowledge Check 8.1: Client Documentation and Interviews"

    1. During an immigration interview, the visa officer may ask questions that might appear to be rude or insensitive. The client is not obligated to answer every single question if they are personally offended by the implications in the officer's line of questioning.

        - [x] False
    > A client is required to satisfy the visa officer that they meet the eligibility criteria for their application.

    2. RCIC Mozan has just established her immigration practice and has signed her first client, Julia. Julia emails Mozan a zip file containing scans of her passport, work permit, birth certificate, language test report, educational credential assessment report, and reference letters from her previous employers.

        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
    
            > IRCC requires an official letter from one or more financial institutions — not a personal explanation — to meet the proof of funds requirement. The letter must:
            
            > - Be printed on the institution's letterhead
            > - List all current bank and investment accounts, including account numbers, opening dates, current balances, and average balances for the past six months
            > - Also include outstanding debts like credit cards or loans 

    5. Ashlynn is assisting her client, Ching-Hua, in preparing for an interview at the visa office in Beijing, China. After reviewing the application, Ashlynn notices that the job description listed in the application does not fully match the one in Ching-Hua’s resume. She anticipates that the officer may question Ching-Hua to clarify this potential inconsistency. If the officer asks, “Describe your position and responsibilities at 123 Company Ltd.?”, which of the following responses should Ashlynn help Ching-Hua prepare, to best address the officer’s concerns?

During one of his consultations, Paul had told Noriko that he was convicted of a summary offence more than 10 years ago, and he had duly answered a full list of background statutory declaration questions. He signed this document at the same time as his service agreement. Noriko is, therefore, **not required** to include another list of background declaration questions on a personal history questionnaire to be sent to Paul.

Before coming to Canada, she lived in France for seven consecutive months. She now needs to provide a police certificate from France.

        Priya obtained a police certificate from France five years ago, before she left the country, and asks whether she can use it for her application.

        > F is correct: Police certificates that meet IRCC's timing rules are acceptable, even if they have technically "expired." 

        > G is correct: Officers have discretion and may request additional documents at any stage.

    9. At the beginning of an interview with a visa officer, the officer will typically start with asking baseline questions, such as identity, age, address, etc. This line of questioning is asked to help the officer establish the applicant's behavioural and speech patterns when answering questions truthfully, thereby allowing them to identify when they are not being truthful.
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False
