# Module 5 - Opening and Running an Immigration Practice

## Notes

??? note "Tutorial notes"

    - Thursday 4:00pm.

??? note "Introduction"

    - Business Development Bank of Canada, ‘How to write an effective business plan’ (2025), [online](https://www.bdc.ca/en/articles-tools/start-buy-business/start-business/how-write-business-plan){:target="\_blank"}
    - BPlans, ‘How to Write a Business Plan for a Small Business’ (2024), [online](https://www.bplans.com/business-planning/how-to-write/){:target="\_blank"}
    - A **PEST (Political, Economic, Social, and Technological)** analysis looks at external factors that might impact your business. These are typically factors that you have no control over; however, conducting an analysis of these factors allows you to be prepared and helps you to plan for how you might respond to potential impacts. Sometimes PEST is extended to **PESTLE**, which includes **Legal and Environmental factors**. Since your immigration business is likely to be influenced by changes in legislation, adding the extra components in a PESTLE analysis may be worthwhile. 
    - A **SWOT (Strengths, Weaknesses, Opportunities, and Threats)** analysis is a useful exercise as you’re starting your practice, and it helps you examine both internal and external factors that might affect your business. Your strength might be that you are strongly connected in a community that is immigration-oriented, whereas your weakness might be that you only feel comfortable doing refugee cases and not all refugees are in a position to pay you for helping them. An opportunity might be that the government suddenly opens up a new program that will benefit your practice, and a threat might be that a certain PNP suspends a program you rely on for an unspecified amount of time. 
    - When writing your business plan, be sure to include the following: 
        - Executive summary 
        - Business overview (including a brief market analysis) 
        - Sales and marketing plan 
        - Operating plan 
        - Human resources plan, if applicable 
        - Financial plan 
        - Action plan for the first 2–3 years 
        - Appendix (e.g., supplemental information, facts and figures, licenses, permits, logos or trademarks, agreements or contracts, credit history, contact details for business advisors)

???+ note "Client File Management"

    - The client file (physical or electronic) must contain the following:
        - A copy of the service agreement and any other associated agreements 
        - Original or copies of documents for the application: police certificates, education credentials, transcripts, etc.
        - Client property
        - Copies of any correspondence
        - Invoices and other billing documents
        - Draft documents
        - Copies of submissions 
    - Although not required by the Client File Management Regulation, it is highly recommended that all your client files contain a detailed “**file opening memo**.” This memo can include a summary of the client’s application, important notations on admissibility concerns, and reminders on deadlines. 
    - Closed files must be retained in a secure and accessible location for at least **six years** after closing the file.
    - Several immigration software tools are available to help you manage your client files. Consider one of the following programs for your immigration practice:
