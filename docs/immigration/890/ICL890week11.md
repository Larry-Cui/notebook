# Module 11 - Career Development and Leadership

## Notes

??? note "Tutorial notes"

    - Thursday 4:00pm.

??? note "Leadership in Immigration Practice"

    - **Self-awareness and personal development:** Good leaders set and prioritize goals and take responsibility for accomplishing them or accept blame when things go wrong. They avoid distractions while they are focused on a task, and they set boundaries between their personal and professional lives. Remember that your employees will follow your lead—if they see you working long into the night, they will assume they must do the same. Good leaders also conduct self-assessments to check their own biases, retain awareness of their strengths and weaknesses, and encourage feedback from their employees on ways to improve in their role.
    - **Focus on developing others:** Delegating, coaching, and mentoring are important tasks that a good leader takes seriously. They actively show empathy when coaching employees on new applications, and they oversee the completion of difficult tasks by demonstrating how it can be done. A good leader also makes training a priority in their practice, whether it is by way of ensuring everyone has the opportunity to attend educational workshops, or by seeking private training opportunities from senior practitioners for all employees.
    - **Strategic or creative thinking:** Instead of simply instructing their employees on completing a certain type of application for a client, good leaders encourage others to suggest options where the client may also reach their immigration goals. Leaders will hold frequent office meetings and encourage employees to contribute their suggestions for improving office operations and will then implement suggestions as appropriate.

??? note "Mental Health Management Strategies"

    - Learn to say no
        - One strategy (RCIC performance indicator 9.1.6) is to use insight into personal expertise and limitations. If you feel that you have taken on more applications than you can handle, particularly if you work alone, then refer new clients to trusted practitioners. Distinguish between the “should” and “musts” when deciding whether to accept a new client and when possible, decline the client if you feel that you cannot dedicate sufficient attention or focus on their application. It is important to “recognize and exercise professional judgment within the limits of individual qualifications” (RCIC performance indicator 6.1.4). 
    - Pare down the tasks
        - Pending deadlines for applications and IRCC requests can be a major stressor. Prioritize the responsibilities that are important and focus on those. Ask the client if they can assist you with preparing certain documents instead of trying to complete them for them. If necessary, reach out to another practitioner for some assistance.
    - Create a balanced schedule
        - Decide on a work schedule and stick to it. This is especially important for newer practitioners who work alone, where you may feel like you must respond to clients quickly or put in more hours to complete applications. However, this is a recipe for burnout. Find a balance between your work and family life and set aside leisure time for social activities as well as downtime where you are not checking emails or working on a file.
    - Problem-solve with a different mindset
        - Two performance indicators or strategies under RCIC competency 9.1 are to use critical thinking and personal insight to consider a fresh perspective to conceive a new or original perspective or solution. If you are facing a stressful situation about an application, take half an hour to pause and regroup, listen to some music, read a few chapters of a book, or watch an episode of a show.
    - Accept the uncontrollable
        - In an immigration application, many things can happen beyond our control. Processing delays, policy changes, and errors made by IRCC can all be stressors. Rather than stressing out over them when they occur, focus on what you can do to rectify the situation to the best of your ability.
    - Exercise regularly
        - Exercise releases endorphins, which can act as a huge stress reliever. Try to exercise for 30 minutes or more each time, even if you are only doing small activities like taking a walk or a set of jumping jacks.
    - Connect to others
        - Our work as consultants can often be lonely, especially if you work alone. Reach out to other practitioners to discuss problems with a file, or meet them for coffee or lunch to talk about your days and other topics not related to work. In relation, the RCIC competency 6.1 recommends the following strategies:  
            - Seek feedback from clients and peers
            - Seek support and assistance when needed
            - Build and use collaborative relationships for development, counsel and referrals
    - Learn to seek help
        - Knowing how to identify these signs is the first step to knowing when to speak to a professional for help. Unlike physical health conditions like cancer or kidney disease, there is no medical test and can accurately diagnose mental health conditions, but a professional will be able to assess your symptoms and diagnose your condition and prescribe treatment options, which can range from making lifestyle changes to therapy or medication.

??? note "Managing Conflict with Staff and Clients"

    - Show empaphy
        - Only focusing on how the conflict has negatively impacted you or your team is not productive to resolving the conflict. Consider why the client (or staff member) is upset or disappointed and consider how a mistake in their file could have jeopardized their application. Express to the client that you understand the motivations behind the client’s dissatisfaction. Try similar approaches for projects where a staff member is feeling the same way.
    - Focus on your body language
        - Keep the tone of your voice neutral and your facial expression relaxed. If you are meeting the client or staff member in person to resolve a conflict, avoid crossing your arms (which suggests aggression) and refrain from shifting in your chair.
    - Focus on the facts
        - If the client is dissatisfied with your file preparation process, describe in detail how the file was prepared and the effort that you have put into research. Start the conversation by outlining the facts—the what, how, and why—and refrain from voicing your personal opinions of the client’s case. If you feel like expressing emotions, use phrases such as “I feel…” or “When you mention this, it caused me to feel…” This same approach is useful for staff and the specific project or process you are doing with them.
    - Allow the other person to speak
        - Your client or staff member may be dissatisfied because they feel like they are not being heard. If you have already identified an issue and are working to solve the conflict, be sure to allow the client or staff member to fully express their feelings and thoughts. Ask them for details of what they feel has happened but do not jump to defend yourself or your team. Once you have obtained a clear narrative from the client or staff member, work with them to come to a resolution that works for all parties.
    - Acknowledge mistakes
        - When conflict arises due to a mistake, acknowledge the mistake and accept responsibility for your part. Calmly explain what happened and provide suggestions for how you will correct the mistake and prevent it from happening in the future.
    - Focus on the goal
        - Sometimes the client or staff member can be so focused on the perceived errors or mistakes that they forget what the end goal is. If the situation can be resolved and the client’s application was not jeopardized, then emphasize that fact. Ask if you can move forward with continuing the application and re-establish your expertise on the matter and your commitment to the client’s application.

## Quizzes

??? note "Knowledge Check 11.1: Career Development and Leadership"

    1. RCIC Lara and two of her classmates from her graduate diploma program have decided to start a business together. They have decided to each hire an assistant to help them with their own applications and client management. Since they will be managing a practice with at least six employees, they have decided to develop and implement a **company culture** book to encourage collaboration between all of them.  In doing so, they need to ask and answer for themselves, the following questions: 
          1. What are their core values? 
          2. What do they want to achieve? 
          3. How many people will they need to achieve their goals? 
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
    > The number of employees they will need to achieve their goal, should be part of a hiring plan but not a part of their "company culture".  **A company's culture refers to the attitudes and behaviors of a company and its employees**, and how these attributes can lead to further success for the company. 

    2. The article "Mindfulness" from the Canadian Mental Health Association states that "mindfulness" is defined as maintaining happy or positive thoughts. 
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
    > **Mindfulness helps us become aware of all kinds of thoughts and sensations**, pleasant or unpleasant, and helps us let them be.  The goal is to **notice** thoughts and the way those thoughts make us feel.  

    3. Federal legislation governs the obligations of the employer in terms of **fair wages, hours of work, and vacation time**. 
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
    > **Provincial legislations govern these obligations**. 

    4. RCIC Evelyn was a sole practitioner for almost three years before making the decision to hire her first employee. She is seeking to hire a part-time bookkeeper to assist her with some accounting tasks. Her father, now retired, was a bookkeeper for 30 years and has offered to help Evelyn with the position. He declined to be paid as an employee, to help Evelyn save money. At Evelyn's insistence, her father finally agrees to accept a $500 one-time payment for his work. Evelyn is not required to report this payment as income paid to an employee. 
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False
    > Evelyn's father can be classified as a self-employed contractor of her business. For reporting purposes, **an employer only needs to report self-employed commissions that are more than $500 on a T4A slip**. 

    5. RCIC Regina was retained by Colin and Andrew to submit a family class application in July 2019. Colin, the principal applicant, was previously convicted of an indictable offence and completed his term of imprisonment over six years ago. Thus, Regina also submitted an application for rehabilitation with the application for permanent residence. Both Colin and Andrew were given a copy of the application after it was submitted. It has now been over two years since the application was submitted, and they have received no correspondence whatsoever on the application. Colin and Andrew are both extremely upset at the lack of movement on their file and accuses Regina of submitting an incomplete application. What could Regina have done to avoid this conflict? (Select the best answer.) 
        - [ ] Explained the contents of their application in detail.
        - [ ] Send regular status progress update requests to IRCC.
        - [x] Advised them of additional processing time on rehabilitation applications.
        - [ ] Terminated the retainer before Colin and Andrew got upset.

    6. RCIC Indie operates a growing consulting practice where she has hired three assistants over the past two years. She offers competitive wages based on experience, extended health benefits, and annual salary increases following performance reviews. Indie is now seeking additional ways to enhance employee satisfaction to promote long-term retention and engagement. Which of the following would be the most appropriate strategy for Indie to implement at this stage? (Select the best answer.)
        - [x] Organize seasonal team-building events and offer occasional early leave days to promote work-life balance.
        - [ ] Increase employees' workloads to offer them more responsibility and career advancement.
        - [ ] Offer semi-annual salary increases to show continuous financial recognition.
        - [ ] Introduce a formal internal competition for "Employee of the Month" with a monetary bonus.
        - [ ] Introduce a mandatory continuing education policy requiring employees to complete two courses per year.
    > While offering career advancement, education, or monetary incentives can contribute to employee motivation, forcing additional workload, mandatory education, or creating internal competition may not necessarily enhance day-to-day job satisfaction and could even create stress or division among employees. Simple, positive initiatives that foster a sense of appreciation and balance—such as social events and early leave opportunities—are low-cost, sustainable strategies that are particularly valuable in small practices.

    7. RCIC Buly manages a large practice that has three locations across Manitoba: Winnipeg, Brandon, and Neepawa. He himself is based in his Winnipeg office. Buly employs seven assistants in total at the three offices, none of whom are RCICs. Buly is the only RCIC. Since he works and resides primarily in Winnipeg, he leaves a stack of signed original "Use of Representative Forms" in each of the other offices and instructs his employees to have clients sign them to complete applications. What should Buly also do to ensure that he is ethically managing his staff in all three locations? Select all that apply.
        - [ ] Delegate a general manager at each location to supervise the preparation and finalization of all applications.
        - [x] Review all applications digitally for completion and errors.
        - [x] Establish a shared database of active files to receive updates on and oversee application progress on each file.
        - [ ] Delegate a general manager at each location to conduct employee performance reviews each year.
        - [ ] Train and assign a mentor to each group of two assistants at each location to conduct employee performance reviews each year.
    > **Buly is responsible for all applications and work completed by his staff**. Although he can delegate tasks to assistants to complete applications, **he must ultimately be the one to review files before submission and to oversee the progress on applications.** By establishing a shared database of active files, he will be able to confirm which assistant is working on which file, and he will be able to conduct performance reviews based on their assigned work. 

    8. RCIC Emma submitted Mason's application for permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Worker program almost two years ago. The application was finally approved last week, and Emma sends Mason an invoice for the final installment of her fee. Mason refused to pay, citing significant delays in the processing of the application as being Emma's fault. Emma sends him one more request for payment. **She is not required to provide any other explanation to Mason, and she can proceed with taking legal action against Mason for non-payment.** 
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False
    > Emma will have to follow the requirements of her provincial or territorial small claims court in order to file a complete claim, such as serving him notice of a claim, but she is not legally obligated to provide any explanation or to settle with him outside of taking legal action, as long as she has completed her obligations to him under their retainer agreement.  

    9. RCIC Caran has hired her first assistant. She has reviewed her business finances and confirmed that she can afford to pay for an assistant's salary, extended benefits, membership expenses, and perhaps even a Christmas bonus. Her assistant is experienced in temporary residence applications and does not need additional training on how to prepare applications. Nevertheless, what other resource should she prepare to ensure that her new employee's transition goes smoothly?  (Select the best answer.) 
        - [ ] A database of links to useful pages on the internet and on IRCC's website.
        - [ ] A list of contact information for IRCC's visa offices and the Client Service Centre.

        - [x] Access to the company's application and submission letter templates.

    10. RCIC Hester is considering hiring three employees in an effort to expand her business. What are some important factors she must keep in mind when developing her human resources strategy? Select all that apply.
        - [ ] The location of her business and proximity to public transit.
        - [x] Her ability to train her new employees.
        - [x] Her budget and financial ability to pay her new employees.
        - [x] Her performance review process.
        - [ ] The ethnicities of her prospective employees.

    11. RCIC Amisha manages a staff of two assistants and a bookkeeper. One of her assistants, Martha, is experienced in working on Family Class applications, while the other assistant, Nathan, is responsible for their practice's Express Entry applications.  Amisha would like them to each learn from the other so they can become more knowledgeable on other types of applications. Amisha should ask Martha and Nathan to each develop a training program and train each other on how they prepare the applications assigned to them.

        - [x] True
        - [ ] False

    15. Identifying mental health concerns that affect your professional competence is important. Mental health issues vary widely and may include anxiety, depression, and burnout. Manifestations or signs of mental health issues may include substance abuse, addictions, eating disorders and other issues.
