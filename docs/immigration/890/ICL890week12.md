## Notes

??? note "Tutorial notes"

    - Thursday 4:00pm.

??? note "Role of Advanced Analytics in Immigration Practice"

    - Advanced Analytics is a modern approach to data analysis, of which artificial intelligence is one tool. By employing the term "Advanced Analytics" instead of "Artificial Intelligence," IRCC is signalling that it uses a broad range of autonomous and semi-autonomous data analysis techniques beyond just AI.

## Quizzes

??? note "Knowledge Check 12.1: Advanced Analytics & Special Topics"

    1. The federal government has defended the use of Artificial Intelligence as a way to promote "efficient, accurate, consistent and interpretable" decisions under Acts of Parliament.  This means that at its core, **artificial intelligence is to be used alongside human decision-making processes**.

        - [ ] False
    > All decisions will continue to be subject to the rules of procedural fairness.

    > Advanced Analytics' role in immigration application processing has not been used to screen applicants for criminal histories, or to ensure a decision is bias-free (as human officers are required to make those decisions), or to screen for completion.  

    6. Canada is not the only country in the world using AI technology to improve the quality and efficiency of services and programs, many of which are powered by AI according to Lucia Nalbandian in the "Canada should be transparent in how it uses AI to screen immigrants" article. Canada is using an automated system trained on rules by experienced officers to identify characteristics in applications that: 
        - [ ] Indicate admissibility
        - [x] Have a higher likelihood of ineligibility
        - [ ] Are eligible
        - [ ] Review is needed for, by an immigration officer

What is one of his **concerns** with IRCC's current practice of using tools like Chinook to assist in processing files?
        - [ ] Risk indicators and flags are defined in such detail that it will be difficult for the decision to be judicially reviewed by the Federal Court.
        - [x] Applicants may be profiled in a manner that breaches procedural fairness.
        - [ ] Working notes will be kept on file for such an extended period of time that future applications may receive unfair bias.
        - [ ] By denying many applicants, the Federal Court will become backlogged with and increasing number of applicants seeking Judicial Review of decisions.

    10. Using critical thinking and personal insight to approach an application differently may involve seeking outside perspectives, such as retaining co-counsel, but it also includes independent techniques like stepping away from the file to refresh your mindset.
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False

    11. It has been argued that use of Advanced Analytics would gradually reduce procedural fairness concerns because the system renders impartial decisions. 
        - [ ] True

    12. Immigration software can streamline your operations to increase productivity and minimize some of your operational costs. In her article on “best immigrations software,” Bell R. Webster talks about the best immigration software for Canadian immigration professionals. Some of the tasks that are included in the different packages are (select all that apply):
        - [x] Securely store client information
        - [x] Reminder system 
        - [ ] **Library** of PNP and Federal forms in English, French, **Chinese and Hindi** 
        - [x] Facilitates collaboration for team members 
        - [x] Sync immigration assessment management to your website 
        - [x] Auto scores economic candidates
        - [x] Client management data base 
        - [ ] Document **fraud detection** system

    13. In IRCC's report "Algorithmic Impact Assessment," it is noted that a digital system will be replacing a human officer's role in determining eligibility assessment.
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False
    > **The system will automate the approval of the eligibility of some applicants for temporary resident visas.** For applications where the positive eligibility determination is automated by the system, the system determines only that an applicant is eligible, before the application is sent to an officer to screen for admissibility. Even in cases where the system approves the eligibility, officers continue to make the admissibility determination and the final decision on each application. As a result, there is officer review of all applications. If an officer encounters information in the course of their admissibility assessment that may affect the positive eligibility determination, they may revisit the eligibility determination of an application. For applications where there is no automated positive eligibility determination, the advanced data analytics system makes no determinations or recommendations vis-à-vis their ineligibility, and this must be determined by officers.

    14. It is important to identify a secure way of managing your client's passwords and application accounts for the following reason (select the best reason):  
        - [ ] Clients will be able to help you finalize applications and review information before submission.
        - [ ] Your staff will be able to access client's application accounts easily.
        - [ ] Your clients will not need to try to remember different passwords for different application systems.
        - [x] You will be able to maintain client confidentiality by preventing keylogging malware or accidentally releasing critical client information.
