# Module 1 - Legal Skills

## Notes

??? note "Tutorial notes"

    - Thursday 4:00pm.

??? note "The Domains of Reflective Practice"

    - **Self-reflection:** asks you to consider your personal and professional identity, your values and your personal development.  It includes reflection on your worldview, your beliefs, assumptions, and biases; but also on your inter-personal relationships, including professional relationships; self-care and your response to stress; and how you self-advocate. 
    - **Reflection on Practice:** takes as its starting point an act of some kind.  In the context of legal skills, reflection on practice often involves a consideration of the process of legal research, legal reasoning, and legal writing.
    - **Critical Reflection:** For an immigration consultant, this might include a critical assessment of the structures of law and the process of justice as experienced by vulnerable clients.  It might also involve an assessment of processes and practices that are not optimal - and then a consideration of how you might go about improving those situations.
