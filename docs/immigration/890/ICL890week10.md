??? note "IRCC Submission Portals"

    - **Prior to 2012**: all manner of immigration applications were submitted to IRCC **by mail**.  Applicants or their Authorized Representatives were expected to download an application package from the IRCC website, fill out all the application forms, and include copies of required and supporting documentation.  Many applications, such as those under business immigration programs, could have up to 500 pages of application forms and documents! 
    - **In September 2012**, IRCC introduced the **Authorized Representative Portal**, which is commonly referred to by practitioners as “the AR Portal” or simply “the Portal.”  The Portal allows authorized paid representatives (APR) to complete, pay for, and submit online applications on behalf of their clients. At the time, only temporary residence applications such as work permits, study permits, visitor records, or temporary resident visas could be submitted through the Portal. IRCC promised faster processing times, streamlined access to correspondence, and more.
    - **In January 2015**, IRCC introduced **a portal for submitting EE profiles** and full applications. It was game-changing for IRCC and for Authorized Representatives. It did have the effect of forcing representatives to do a lot of data entry (the profile is very repetitive) and to show the client the profile means screenshots of a LOT of pages. A summary page would be great, but we don’t have it as yet. 
    - **March 2020**. There was a distinct difference in service delivery standards between paper-based applications and electronic applications.  For this reason, among others, IRCC has worked hard to push through the use of online application methods, especially in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. Since March 2020, IRCC has digitized citizenship tests, moved citizenship ceremonies online, and launched an online “landing” process, which eliminated the need for approved permanent residents to be subjected to in-person landing interviews. 
    - **By 2022**, IRCC introduced at least six additional online portals to receive and manage applications.
        - The [PR Application Portal](https://prson-srpel.apps.cic.gc.ca/en/rep/login){:target="\_blank"} was introduced to the public in March 2021 and opened for authorized representatives in September 2021.  This Portal now processes all previously paper-based permanent residence applications.
        - The [Employer Portal](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/partners-service-providers/employer-portal.html){:target="\_blank"} was introduced between 2014 and 2015 to allow Canadian employers to submit their job offers directly to IRCC, for LMIA-exempt work permits. 
        - The **TR-to-PR Pathway Portal** was only open between May 5, 2021 and November 4, 2021 to receive and process applications that were received through that particular pathway program.
        - The [Citizenship Portal](https://citapply-citdemande.apps.cic.gc.ca/en/landing){:target="\_blank"} was opened in late 2021 for clients to apply for citizenship on their own.
        - The [Temporary Resident Visa and Study Permit Portal](https://portal-portail.apps.cic.gc.ca/signin?lang=en){:target="\_blank"}, which opened in mid-2021, allows representatives and applicants to submit temporary resident visas and initial study permits in a streamlined process.
        - **Canada Post e-Post Connect**, though not technically developed by IRCC, the department is now using this portal to receive and process applications in the **Hong Kong Pathway**. 
    - There are **three types of accounts** that authorized paid representatives (APRs) can use to complete and submit applications on behalf of their clients. The appropriate account depends on the type of application and client situation. 
        - [https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/partners-service-providers/authorized-paid-representatives-portal.html](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/partners-service-providers/authorized-paid-representatives-portal.html){:target="\_blank"} 
    - Individuals must select the correct portal based on their application type. Guidance on portal selection can be found here on the IRCC page "[Sign into your account](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/ircc-accounts.html){:target="\_blank"}". Examples of portals available to individual applicants include: 
        - IRCC Secure Account 
        - IRCC Portal 
        - Online Citizenship Application Portal 
        - Permanent Residence Portal 
    - Many practitioners are critical of IRCC’s practice of developing new portals to address the individual needs of different applications, instead of developing **a central, cohesive online system to manage intake and facilitate the processing of all applications**.

??? note "Authorized Representative Portal"

    - the Authorized Representative Portal (the “AR Portal”) was introduced in September 2012. It is currently the main portal used by practitioners to submit the following: 
        - Express Entry profiles
        - Permanent residence applications through Express Entry 
        - Temporary residence applications such as work permits, study permits, visitor status extensions, and temporary residence visas 
        - Electronic Travel Authorizations (eTAs)
        - Health care benefits for refugees 
    - What is unique to the AR Portal is that it is **linked** to IRCC’s own internal client information management system, called the Global Case Management System (**GCMS**).  Applications submitted to IRCC through the Authorized Representative Portal is immediately linked to GCMS, which **generates an “acknowledgement of receipt”, and a system file number immediately**.
    - The AR portal also allows you to **link an existing client file**, if you happen to be retained after the client has already begun an application on their own, or if the client wishes to change representatives. This is also unique to the AR Portal, as no other portal allows practitioners to link an existing application. Another unique feature is a list of applications you have begun on behalf of clients.

??? note "Employer Portal"

    - Under the International Mobility Program, every Canadian employer who plans to hire a foreign worker for an LMIA-exempt, employer-specific work permit must register their company in the **Employer Portal**. Companies are registered using their CRA Business Number, which is unique to each business.
    - Employers must submit an **Offer of Employment** and pay a **compliance fee** of $230 through the Employer Portal and obtain an ”**Offer of Employment Number**”. This mandatory piece of information must be included on the application for a work permit.

??? note "The Permanent Residence Portal"

    - Prior to the pandemic, applicants who had received approval on their applications were issued paper Confirmations of Permanent Residence documentation. Those who were residing in Canada were then instructed to exit Canada and, upon return, would have their permanent residence status “confirmed” by a Canada Border Services Agency.
    - In 2020, the department introduced a “virtual” way for new permanent residents to become “landed.” This became the first iteration of the Permanent Residence Portal. Applicants were asked to submit their Unique Client Identifier (UCI) number, application file numbers, a contact email, and to confirm whether they were physically located in Canada. They were then provided with **a temporary password** with which to **create an account on the Permanent Residence Portal**. Upon signing in, they were instructed to upload a digital, passport-style photo with which IRCC would issue their Permanent Resident Cards.
    - In March 2021, IRCC expanded the use of this portal to allow principal applicants to **apply for permanent residence online**. 
    - In September 2021, following this successful “soft launch”, the Permanent Residence Portal was made available to Authorized Representatives, and is now referred to as the "**Representative Permanent Residence (RPR) Portal**." Since then, the RPR Portal has become the main method of submission for all previously paper-based applications.
        - **Economic Programs**
            - Francophone Community Immigration Pilot 
            - Rural Community Immigration Pilot 
            - Provincial Nominee Program (PNP) 
            - Start-Up Business Class 
            - Quebec Skilled Workers Program 
            - Quebec Selected Investor Program
            - Quebec Entrepreneur Program 
            - Quebec Self-Employed Persons Program 
            - Atlantic Immigration Program 
            - Economic Mobility Pathways Pilot 
            - Federal Economic Mobility Pathways Pilot 
        - **Family Class** 
            - Spouse 
            - Common-law Partner 
            - Conjugal Partner 
            - Dependent Child 
            - Other Relative 
            - Adopted Child / Child to be Adopted in Canada 
            - Orphaned Sibling / Nephew / Niece / Grandchild 
        - **Refugee Program Categories** 
            - One-Year Window of Opportunity (OYW) 
            - The Private Sponsorship of Refugees (PSR) Program 
            - In Canada – Protected Person 
        - **Other**
            - In Canada – Humanitarian and Compassionate Considerations 
            - Permit Holder Class 
            - Permanent Residence Pathways for Hong Kong Residents 
            - Permanent Resident Card / Permanent Resident Travel Document applications  
    - **The RPR Portal is not linked to GCMS.** This means that any application submitted through the RPR Portal will be placed in a queue to be manually assigned and reviewed for completion under R10 of the Regulations before an officer will assign a file number and issue an acknowledgment of receipt. However, this process has also been standardized by an identical system at IRCC, so intake management has also been expedited using the PR Portal.
