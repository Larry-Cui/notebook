# Module 7 - Client Interviews

## Notes

??? note "Tutorial notes"

    - Thursday 4:00pm.

??? note "The Client Interview"

    - Develop a system to organize the information you need to effectively advise your client during the actual consultation. The simplest way to do this is to develop a **pre-assessment questionnaire** (PAQ). 
    - In general, the questionnaire should contain the following components:
        - the **date** of consultation or initial interaction with the client
        - the client’s **name**, date and place of birth, contact information, and citizenship
        - the client’s professional and educational **background**
        - any other relevant questions to determine the client’s **eligibility**
    - If you have a client who has a history with IRCC, and especially if they had an immigration interview of any kind, it is important to do an **Access to Information and Privacy (ATIP)** request to find out what happened.

??? note "Design an Interview Script"

    - **Introduce yourself:** Briefly explain your background and your firm's practice areas. Ask for a brief introduction in return, if you haven't already received one from a phone call or email.
    - **Address the client's main concerns:** Reiterate the client's main goals and concerns, so that you can clarify any misunderstandings or communication that may have taken place. Listening and signaling that you understand their questions are great ways to build rapport.
    - **Reassure the client:** If you feel that you are competent to handle the matter for the client, clearly state that you will be able to help them. Tell them your past experiences and provide some examples of similar cases, without compromising the confidentiality of your past clients.
    - **Tell the client what to expect:** Explain how you typically work with clients so they understand what your business relationship will be like. Explain your other services that are included in your service agreement. Remember to discuss legal fees and your scope of service. Avoid legal jargon and explain the process clearly.
    - **Allow the client to ask questions:** Clients should be allowed to jump in during the consultation to ask questions and be provided with a final opportunity to ask questions before wrapping up the consultation.
    - **Wrap up:** Thank the client for their time and emphasize your belief that you are the ideal practitioner to help them with their application.

??? note "Service Agreement"

    - In a consulting practice, a service agreement refers to the written contract between a Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultant (RCIC) and a client.
    - A service agreement must be signed with a client before the RCIC can undertake any services or receive funds from the client. You MUST have an initial consultation agreement signed for your first meeting with the client, even if you do not charge a fee.
    - Your service agreement must first and foremost identify the **primary objective** of your service — are you being retained to assist the client in applying for permanent residence under Express Entry?
    - It is important to keep in mind that a **separate** service agreement is required for each **distinct** immigration matter.
    - A service agreement must include the following components:
        - The client’s name, address, and telephone number (you may also include an email address) 
        - Your name, address, and telephone number 
        - The category of **application** that you have been retained for 
        - A detailed outline of the **scope of services** you will render to the client 
        - The **fees** that the client will be paying, payment terms and conditions, and any disbursements (expenses) that you will charge 
        - **Schedule of payments**, if any 
        - **CICC’s contact information** 
        - The process clients should follow in the event there is a **dispute** and if the client wishes to initiate a complaint 
        - The conditions for **terminating** the service agreement 
        - **Confidentiality** clause 
        - **Refund** policy, if any 
    - Make sure to consult **section 24(3) of the Code** of Professional Conduct for a full list of mandatory components that must be included in every service agreement. 
    - You may structure your fee payment schedule as you see fit, based on your desired income or expenses. Most RCICs prefer to charge fees by **milestone**, meaning they will send an invoice when the client’s application reaches the next stage in processing.
    - **Contingency** billing — where payment is collected only if the application is approved — is **strictly prohibited** by the regulator. 
    - **Scope of Your Services:** for example, if you are being retained to assist a client on a study permit application, you must describe all the necessary steps you will take in preparing this application.
    - You should not render any services that fall **outside the scope** that can be legally and ethically provided by an immigration consultant.
    - Your service agreement must have a clear statement as to the **total consulting fee** you will charge for your service, as well as applicable **taxes** or **disbursements** the client will also be expected to pay.
    - Billing by milestone is a popular and straightforward way of invoicing clients.  Under this method, clients will be billed according to the stage at which the application has progressed.  For example:
        - The first payment of $____ upon the execution of the service agreement (this would cover our initial consultation and preliminary research).
        - The second and final payment of $____ upon submission of the application (this would cover file preparation).
    - **Dispute resolution:** This mandatory clause sets out the process by which you can resolve any disputes arising from your services. In the event of a dispute, you are encouraged to resolve the matter between yourself and the client civilly. If the dispute cannot be resolved this way, then the client must be provided with the resources to file a complaint in writing to CICC. Your service agreement must provide the CICC’s complaints and discipline procedure, or an accessible link directly to the Make a Complaint page on the CICC website.
    - ***Force majeure:*** A *force majeure* clause is included in all service agreements to protect your practice when extraordinary or extreme events make it difficult or impossible to continue performing the scope of your services. The clause will often refer to language such as “war,” “natural disasters,” or “acts of God.” If such incidents beyond your control result in your inability to fulfil your obligations, you would not be found at fault.
    - **Changes in policy:** As with *force majeure*, you would also not be found liable for change in policy beyond your control. For example, if a certain province decided to terminate one of their PN programs, and this has an impact on your client's application to that province, you could not be found to be at fault.
    - Termination: Your service agreement can be terminated in any of the following circumstances:
        - You have **fulfilled** your obligations to the client (i.e., their application has been processed to finalization)
        - The client’s circumstances have changed to the extent where you can **no longer proceed** with the agreement under the same scope of services
        - The client chooses to **withdraw** their agreement
        - You choose to **withdraw** from representing the client

## Quizzes

??? note "Knowledge Check 7.1: Client Interviews and Service Agreements"

    1. Martha has asked to retain RCIC Oliver to assist her in applying for a Super Visa for her father. Her father signs a service agreement with Oliver and pays his professional fees in full. Just before the application is approved, Martha’s mother asks to retain Oliver to help her apply for a Super Visa, as well. Martha’s parents are divorced and will argue every time they see each other. The last time they were in the same room, they began physically fighting with each other. Oliver should decline to represent Martha's mother on her application.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
    > **Oliver is not obligated to decline representing Martha's mother unless their respective interests, rights, or obligation will conflict.** In this scenario, the conflict only exists in their personal relationship with one another. However, their conflict will not jeopardize each other's applications for temporary resident visas.

    2. Adanna wants to retain RCIC Ngozi to assist with a Temporary Resident Visa application for her sister. Ngozi sends her a service agreement to review and sign. Adanna asks whether she will receive a refund of Ngozi’s professional fees if the application is refused. Which of the following are appropriate responses for Ngozi? Select all that apply.
        - [ ] Ngozi should include a refund clause in the service agreement stating that Adanna will receive a full refund if the application is refused.
        - [ ] Ngozi should explain that his fees will be refunded as "unearned funds" if the application is refused.
        - [x] Ngozi should explain that his professional fees are not refundable if the application is refused.
        - [ ] Ngozi should explain that a partial refund will be issued if the application is refused.
        - [x] Ngozi should ensure that the service agreement clearly outlines his refund policy before Adanna signs it.
    > **C is correct because professional fees are charged for the services rendered, not based on the application outcome**. A refusal does not automatically entitle the client to a refund. **E is also correct because refund terms must be clearly outlined in the service agreement.**

    3. RCIC Manpreet is preparing to meet with a potential client who wishes to apply for permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Worker program. She has prepared printouts of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations (IRPR) provisions on Skilled Workers and language test equivalency charts. She has also prepared a pre-assessment questionnaire that she will ask the potential client to complete prior to their meeting. What are the necessary components of the questionnaire that Manpreet must include to help her determine the client's potential eligibility?
        - [x] The client's professional and educational background, the client's date of birth, the client's knowledge of English or French, and the client's family composition.
        - [ ] The date of the consultation, the client's knowledge of English or French, and the client's country of citizenship.
        - [ ] The client's educational background, the client's overseas work experience, and the client's knowledge of French.
        - [ ] The client's criminal background, the client's Canadian work experience, and the client's family composition.

    4. Shyla has asked to retain RCIC Ishaan to assist with a Temporary Resident Visa application for her father. During the initial consultation, Ishaan asks Shyla’s father about his financial situation. He mentions receiving rental income from an investment property and having several relatives in his home country. He also refers to Shyla’s stable, well-paying job in Canada but does not mention personal savings. How should Ishaan interpret this information? Select the best answer. 
        - [ ] Shyla's father does not have any personal funds or assets.
        - [ ] Shyla is expected to cover all expenses for her father's visit to Canada.
        - [ ] Financial support will come entirely from Shyla and her father's relatives.
        - [x] Shyla and her father's relatives may assist financially, but he may also have some personal income from rental property.

    5. During an initial consultation, RCIC Jackson notices that the potential client, Pinky, often changes the subject to avoid answering a question. After a minute or two of Pinky talking about a different topic, Jackson will remind Pinky of the original question and insist that she provide a proper answer. Pinky is becoming more flustered each time Jackson demands an answer. How should Jackson address the matter instead? Select the best answer.
        - [ ] Pay more attention to what Pinky is saying and try to "read between the lines" for the correct answer.
        - [ ] Ask Pinky to provide the actual answer in writing.
        - [x] Ask closed questions to summarize what Jackson knows of so far, and then ask clarifying questions that are relevant to the topics being discussed, then use Pinky's answers to ask more closed questions if necessary.
        - [ ] Advise Pinky of the consequences of misrepresentation if she does not answer questions truthfully on her application.

    6. Leslie has asked to retain RCIC Mousa to assist her in applying for a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) for her father. Mousa sends Leslie a service agreement to review and sign. Leslie notes that the service agreement does not specify which country's visa office will process her father's TRV application. Mousa tells Leslie that this information is not required on a service agreement. Leslie disagrees and tells Mousa that he must clearly outline the scope of his services, so the service agreement must correctly identify the Visa Office. Is this true or false?
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
    > The service agreement must specify the category of the client's application and the scope of services Mousa will provide to the client. The service agreement is **not required to specify the visa office location.** This information is fluid and outside the control of the RCIC.

    7. Michiyo has asked to retain RCIC Takeshi to assist her in applying for a Temporary Resident Visa for her mother. Takeshi sends Michiyo a service agreement to review and sign. Michiyo wants Takeshi to draft a Japanese version of the service agreement, or otherwise provide her mother with a Japanese translation of the service agreement, so that her mother is fully aware of the scope of Takeshi's services. Takeshi tells Michiyo that since the service agreement must be signed in English or French, he is not obligated to provide a translation to her mother. Is this true or false?
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False
    > Although Takeshi does not have to provide a Japanese translation of the service agreement, he should still **provide such a document in good faith** and in the interest in maintaining a positive client relationship.

    8. RCIC Paula will be meeting with her first client in a few days. She has had one phone call with the client and answered a few of his questions by email. Paula has a good idea of which application category the client is eligible for. Today, Paula is developing **an interview script** to refer to during the consultation, and she has highlighted several key points to focus on. **What are those key points?** Select the best answer.
        - [ ] The preferred method of communication with the client, how Paula will handle the application for the client, her fees, and where she will meet the client.
        - [ ] Providing the client with an accurate document checklist, answering all of the client's questions, and the retainer fees that Paula expects the client to pay.
        - [x] The client's immigration goal and existing concerns, the scope of Paula's services, the terms in her service agreement, and answering the client's questions.
        - [ ] Whether the client is inadmissible to Canada, how to overcome any inadmissibility issues, and how Paula can help the client extend their temporary resident status.

    9. During an initial consultation, RCIC Callie provides Francis with an overview of how the Express Entry system works, discusses whether he appears to meet the eligibility criteria for the Canadian Experience Class, and explains approximate processing timelines. She also gives a general estimate of his potential Comprehensive Ranking System (CRS) score. Francis then asks Callie to review his employment letter to confirm whether it would meet IRCC’s requirements. Callie is not yet retained and has not reviewed any of Francis’s documentation in detail. How should Callie respond to Francis? 
        - [ ] Review the letter and confirm whether it meets IRCC's requirements.
        - [ ] Decline to answer the question, as the consultation time is over.
        - [x] Advise Francis that she can review the letter and provide a detailed opinion once he has retained her services.
        - [ ] Offer to send Francis a sample employment letter template so he can assess his own document.

    10. RCIC Emma is a new practitioner who is in the process of creating a customized Pre-Assessment Questionnaire for her consultations. To eliminate confusion, Emma has included components that assess all types of immigration applications, including the Canadian Experience Class, Family Class, and Business Immigration categories. As a general principle, she plans to ask her clients to complete the entire questionnaire. This is the only way to ensure no information is left out.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
    > You are advised to create a **concise Pre-Assessment Questionnaire** with components customized to different categories of immigration. You can create as many different customized questionnaires as you would like but having a concise version will be less work for the client and will allow you to determine their eligibility in a reasonable amount of time.

    11. Sahil has asked to retain RCIC Leena to assist him in applying for a Temporary Resident Visa for his mother. Leena sends Sahil a service agreement to review and sign. Sahil reviews Leena's outlined scope of services and notices that Leena did not mention whether she will assist his mother with an interview at the visa office. He asks Leena to include this service in the agreement. Leena tells Sahil that in her experience, TRV applicants are rarely asked to attend an interview at the visa office. However, Leena promises Sahil that if his mother is selected by chance, she will prepare her for an interview. She tells Sahil it is not required to explicitly state this on the service agreement as it is not likely to happen. Is this true or false?
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False

    12. Olafemi has retained RCIC Barika to assist with a Study Permit application for his daughter. After signing the service agreement and paying Barika’s professional fees in full, Barika begins working on the file but realizes she is not sufficiently experienced with this type of application. She discusses the matter with Olafemi and suggests involving another RCIC, Julienne, to assist her. Olafemi agrees. If Julienne agrees to share the work on the file, what should happen next? Select all that apply.
        - [x] Update the service agreement to include Julienne's name and describe the services she will provide.
        - [ ] Ask Olafemi to provide written consent for Julienne to assist with the application.
        - [ ] Draft a new service agreement to be signed by Julienne and Olafemi only.
        - [x] Ensure that the service agreement reflects the roles of both RCICs involved.
    > Section 24(3)(e) of the Code requires that any person likely to assist in the provision of immigration or citizenship consulting services be **named in the service agreement**, along with a description of the services they will provide. The client should be made aware of who will assist and in what capacity.

    13. Barbara is currently in Toronto on a Post-Graduation Work Permit (PGWP) and has been working full-time as a graphic designer for the past year. She meets with RCIC Adam to explore her options for permanent residence. She tells Adam that her cousin owns a restaurant and is willing to offer her a job as a Cook, which is a targeted occupation under the category-based selection system.

        When Adam asks about her experience in the food industry, Barbara avoids answering directly and says, “I’d mostly be helping him with marketing, but we can list me as a Cook for immigration purposes. That way I might qualify if there’s another draw.” How should Adam respond?

        Select the best answer.

        - [ ] End the consultation and inform Barbara that she is not eligible to apply for permanent residence.
        - [ ] Caution Barbara that what she's proposing may amount to misrepresentation and recommend she consider alternative pathways to permanent residence.
        - [x] Ask clarifying questions to understand Barbara's actual job duties and explain that claiming experience in a role she does not perform would constitute misrepresentation.
        - [ ] Recommend that Barbara ask her cousin to create a Cook job offer and trust that the experience can be built over time.

    14. You’ve just begun a consultation with a potential client. During the conversation, you notice that the client is hesitant in answering questions, stutters, and repeatedly smooths the back of his hair while speaking. How should you best respond to these verbal and non-verbal cues?
        - [ ] Ask the client to write down his thoughts if he is struggling to express them verbally.
        - [ ] Offer the services of an interpreter in case the client is having difficulty with English.
        - [ ] Offer the client a glass of water to ease his discomfort and help with the stuttering.
        - [x] Give the client time to finish, then ask a clarifying question before continuing.
