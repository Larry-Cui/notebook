# Module 1 - Acquisition of Citizenship

## Notes

??? note "Tutorial notes"

    - Wednesday 4:00pm.

??? note "Introduction"

    - The importance of citizenship was recognized in *Benner v Canada (Secretary of State)*, 1997 CanLII 376 (SCC),  in which Iacobucci J stated: “I cannot imagine an interest more fundamental to full membership in Canadian society than Canadian citizenship” (para 68). This was reiterated in *Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v Tobiass*, 1997 CanLII 322 (SCC), in which the Supreme Court unanimously held that “[f]or some, such as those who might become stateless if deprived of their citizenship, it may be valued as highly as liberty” (para 108).
    - Accordingly, in this course, when we reference “the Act” we mean the ***Citizenship Act*** (RSC, 1985, c C-29), and when we reference the “the regulations” we mean the ***Citizenship Regulations*** (SOR/93-246).

??? note "Who is a Canadian?"

    - There are two ways someone can be a citizen without applying for it: jus soli and jus sanguinis.
    - **jus sanguinis** means citizenship by decent. It currently applies to the first generation born abroad (Bill C-24, 2008). Following the *Bjorkquist* decision (2023), Bill C-71 was introduced in 2024 and proposes to replace the second generation cut-off with a "substantial connection" test going forward.
    - jus soli means citizenship by birth on Canadian soil. Birthright citizenship is automatic but subject to limited exceptions, including: the children of diplomats and foreign officials, who are not granted citizenship because their parents enjoy diplomatic immunity.
    - [*Bjorkquist*](https://canlii.ca/t/k1vdj){:target="\_blank"} and Bill C-3 summary (first generation born abroad)
        - In 2008, a “second-generation cut-off” rule was implemented, which limited citizenship by descent to the first generation born abroad pursuant to s. 3(3)(a) Citizenship Act. In practical terms, if a Canadian obtained their citizenship by descent while being born abroad, the amendment prohibited them passing on their citizenship to their child also born abroad.
        - Bill C-3: An Act to amend the Citizenship Act (2025)  introduces a **substantial connection** test to allow a Canadian parent born abroad, who acquires Canadian citizenship by descent, to pass on citizenship to their child born abroad.
        - To meet the substantial connection test, a Canadian parent born abroad would need to demonstrate they have **accumulated at least 1,095 days of physical presence in Canada before the birth or adoption of the child.** The 1,095 day requirement is cumulative, not in a five (5) year period preceding the birth.
    - The Jus soli exception for diplomatic immunity was tested in the case of [*Vavilov*](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2019/2019scc65/2019scc65.html){:target="\_blank"}.
        - The government originally argued that, despite being born in Toronto, Vavilov did not enjoy birthright citizenship, because his parents were "employees or representatives of a foreign government." The decision was appealed to the Supreme Court, who ruled in Vavlov's favor and his citizenship was reinstated.
    - Applicants who have citizenship by birth or by descent do not need to apply for citizenship. They need to apply for **proof of citizenship** (i.e., citizenship certificates). This is a different application, which requires identity documents and is usually fairly straightforward. The application process can be expedited if the applicant needs citizenship urgently (e.g., for work-related issues).

??? note "Requirements for adult grants"

    - Adult grants are covered under **section 5(1) of the Citizenship Act**. Any of the above requirements can be assessed at any point (e.g., hearings or interviews) during the processing of an application for the grant of citizenship.
    - Make an application for Canadian citizenship or, in the case of a minor, have a person empowered to act on their behalf make the applications [s 5(1)(a)]
    - Be a permanent resident of Canada and have no unfulfilled conditions relating to that status [s 5(1)(c)]
    - Meet residency requirements which include (i) physical presence and (iii) income tax filing [s 5(1)(c)]
    - Have adequate knowledge of one of Canada’s official languages [s 5(1)(d)]
    - Demonstrate in one of Canada’s official languages adequate knowledge of Canada, and the responsibilities and privileges of citizenships [s 5(1)(e)]
    - Not be prohibited under section 21 or 22 of the Citizenship Act
    - Not be under removal order and not subject of a declaration by the Governor in Council made pursuant to section 20 [s 5(1)(f)]

??? note "Residency requirements"

    - Adult applicants must:
        - Be physically present in Canada for at least 1095 days during the 5 years immediately before the date of application; and
        - Meet any applicable requirement under the Income Tax Act to file a return of income for the 3 taxation years that are fully or partially within the 5 years immediately before the date of application
            - **There is no minimum income requirement**, but your client needs proof that taxes were filed and the Income Tax Act was followed, even if no taxes were owed or payment was not required due to an exemption (e.g. U.N. officials).
    - As of October 11, 2017, time spent in Canada as an authorized temporary resident or protected person may be partially used towards an applicant’s physical presence calculation.
        - Each day spent in Canada as a temporary resident or protected person, before becoming a permanent resident within the five-year period before the date of application will count as one **half day**, with a maximum of 365 days towards the physical presence calculation
        - Temporary resident status includes lawful authorization to enter or remain in Canada as a: visitor, student; worker, or temporary resident permit holder
        - A protected person is someone who was found to be in need of protection or a convention refugee by the Immigration and Refugee Board, or a person who received a positive decision on a Pre-Removal Risk Assessment (PRAA) from IRCC
        - Note: **time spent as a refugee claimant (or family member) before positive determination does not count**
    - Any part of a day spent in Canada counts as a full day (day trips should be declared but do not count as absence.)
    - **Count from date the application is signed** (not from when it is received by IRCC or mailed or assessed) and count back five years. This can be helpful or hurtful, but always be sure to leave a buffer.
    - There are exceptions for armed forces serving overseas and spouses (See Module 2 for details).
    - A **Travel History Report** is a record of a traveller's entries, exits or both into Canada as collected by CBSA. It is a new type of document that a representative can request for their client online, through a representative portal. It is a streamlined **ATIP process**, the results of which will be issued in 30 days or less. The retention period for a Travel History Report is listed as 15 years. ICES records are not infallible, as demonstrated by Abu v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), [2015 FC 1389](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2015/2015fc1389/2015fc1389.html?resultIndex=1){:target="\_blank"}.

??? note "Language and knowledge requirements"

    - Applicants between **18 and 54** years of age are required to demonstrate an adequate ability to communicate in either **English** or **French**, pursuant to paragraph 5(1)(d) of the Act
        - The results of an IRCC-approved third-party test, CLB/NCLC Level 4 or higher
        - Proof from certain government-funded language training programs, CLB/NCLC Level 4 or higher
        - Proof of completion of secondary or post-secondary education in English or French, in Canada or abroad
    - Applicants between **18 and 54** years of age are required to demonstrate that they have an adequate **knowledge** of Canada and the responsibilities and privileges of citizenship, pursuant to paragraph 5(1)(e) of the Act.
        - All knowledge test questions are based on information provided in the official citizenship study guide, Discover Canada: The Rights and Responsibilities of Citizenship. Written and oral versions of the test are made up of 20 questions and the passing mark is **75%** (15 out of 20 questions correctly answered).

## Quizzes

??? note "Module 1 Knowledge Check"

    1. Rhodri came to Canada as a refugee from Guyana on January 1, 2014. His daughter, Jemma, was born in December 2014. On January 1, 2015, he was granted refugee protection by the RPD. On January 1, 2016, he became a permanent resident. He has made four overnight trips to the U.S. for one night only but has not otherwise left Canada. In what month did he become eligible for citizenship based on his days of residency?
        - [ ] January 2019
        - [ ] January 2021
        - [ ] January 2018
        - [x] June 2018
    > Additionally, **any part of a day spent in Canada counts as a day of physical presence** – his overnight trips therefore do not deduct from the overall total as he spent at least part of each day in Canada.

    2. Which of the following are among the requirements for an adult grant of citizenship under s. 5 of the Act? (select all that apply)
        - [x] Demonstrating 3 out of 5 years of residence in Canada
        - [x] Filing income taxes
        - [ ] Declaring an intention to reside in Canada
        - [x] Completing a Canadian knowledge test

    3. Which of the following is **not an exception** to the physical presence requirements for residency under the Citizenship Act? (select all that apply)
        - [ ] An applicant who during the six years immediately before the date of their application, completed three years of service in the **Canadian Armed Forces**
        - [x] A permanent resident who is outside Canada accompanying a Canadian citizen who is their spouse or common-law partner or, in the case of a child, their parent
        - [ ] A permanent resident who is the **minor** child of a citizen, if an application for citizenship is made by a person authorized to make the application on their behalf
        - [x] A permanent resident who is outside Canada employed on a full-time basis by a Canadian business

    4. Which of the following individuals must complete an English language test for a regular grant of citizenship under s. 5 of the Act?
        - [ ] A 55 year old applicant with no formal education.
        - [ ] A 34 year old applicant who completed their post-secondary studies at Queen's.
        - [x] A 46 year old applicant who completed their post-secondary studies abroad in Spanish.
        - [ ] A 43 year old who completed LINC (Language Instruction for Newcomers to Canada) training and achieved a CLB of 4
    > Those who are above the age of **54** or who have completed post-secondary studies in English or French, or certain programs such as the LINC and achieved a CLB of 4 or greater, are all exempt from completing an English language test.

    5. Which of the following is **not an exemption to birthright citizenship (jus soli)** for a person if, at the time of his birth, neither of his parents was a citizen or lawfully admitted to Canada for permanent residence and either of his parents was:

        - [x] An employee of a foreign consulate or embassy without diplomatic privileges
    > The children of an employee or staff member of a foreign government in Canada without diplomatic privileges are not prevented from acquiring citizenship by birth in Canada. **They key is whether they enjoy diplomatic privileges and immunities**, as was the case with the son of Russian spies in the Supreme Court's seminal case of *Vavilov*.

    6. Citizenship applicants must have paid taxes for at least 3 of the last 5 years preceding their application for citizenship.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
    > Applicants are not required to have paid any amount in taxes; in many circumstances they may not owe taxes. However, they must have **filed their taxes** and otherwise met their tax filing obligations under the *Income Tax Act* for the appropriate relevant period.

    7. What is **maximum number of citizenship** an individual can hold under Canadian law?
        - [ ] Only Canadian citizenship.

He often pays many of his employees in cash to avoid payroll taxes. Which of the following is true with respect to his **tax obligation**s prior to applying for citizenship?
        - [ ] He must have complied with the tax filing obligations under the Income Tax Act for the last 5 years.
        - [ ] He must have complied with the tax filing obligations under the Income Tax Act for himself and his business for at least 3 of the last 5 years.
        - [x] He must have complied with the tax filing obligations under the Income Tax Act **for himself for the last at least 3 of the last 5 years**.
        - [ ] He must have complied with the tax filing obligations under the Income Tax Act since coming to Canada.
    > The requirements relate to **personal income tax returns**, not taxes for businesses that the applicant may own. They requirement is only **3 of the last 5 years**, however, when he files, the CRA may advise him that he owes back taxes for years past, which he would have to resolve.

    9. Which of the following is **not a method** of acquiring Canadian citizenship?
        - [ ] Jus soli (citizenship by birth)
        - [ ] Jus sanguinis (citizenship by descent)
        - [x] Jure matrimonii (citizenship by marriage)
        - [ ] Naturalization (citizenship by grant)

    10. Konstantina was born in Greece and sponsored to Canada by her husband, Christos, who had recently become a citizen. In Canada, they had a daughter, Maria. After several years, they decided to move back to Greece for work and to be closer to family. In Greece, they had a son, Bill. Which of the following is true regarding the citizenship status of the children?
        - [ ] Neither Maria nor Bill are citizens since Konstantina was not a citizen at the time of their birth.
        - [ ] Maria is a citizen, but Bill is not as he is the second generation born abroad.
        - [x] Both Maria and Bill are Canadian citizens.
        - [ ] Maria is a citizen by birth, but Bill must apply for a grant of citizenship.
    > Both children are citizens. Maria was born in Canada (jus soli), and the first generation born abroad rule does not limit Bill as at least one of his parents was naturalized in Canada after being born abroad (jus sanguinis). **Bill's children, however, would be considered the second generation born abroad and not entitled to citizenship.** Bill does not have to apply for a "grant" of citizenship, just proof of citizenship (i.e. a citizenship certificate application).
