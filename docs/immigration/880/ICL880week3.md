??? note "Prohibitions"

    - **Conviction** for an indictable offense under an Act of Parliament leads to a **4 year** prohibition from applying for or being granted citizenship (s. 22(2))
    - **Two distinctions** from IRPA:
        - Prohibition runs from the date of the conviction, not the completion of the sentence
        - No deeming provision. Hybrid offenses are not automatically considered indictable. Election of Crown prosecutor, whether to pursue as indictable or summary charge, is dispositive under Act.
    - A **conviction** for a foreign offence that could be the equivalent of an indictable offence under an Act of Parliament leads to a **4 year** prohibition to being granted citizenship (s. 22(3)). The individual is also prohibited from citizenship while **serving** a sentence abroad for such an offence (19(1)(a.1)).
        - Recall the equivalency analysis under the IRPA s. 36(1)(b), (2)(b) studied in ICL 870​, the *Hill* approach. 
        - Unlike domestic criminality, it does not matter how the prosecutor treated the charge abroad or how it may have treated it in Canada. ​
        - Distinction from IRPA: **No discretion or H&C waiver** is possible under the Citizenship Act.
    - A person is prohibited from citizenship while **ongoing charge, trial, or appeal** for a foreign offence that could be the equivalent of an indictable offence under an Act of Parliament (see. 22(1)(b.1).)
    - A **discretionary waiver by Minister** is possible (s. 22(1.1)) and can possibly be used in cases such as:
        - the applicant is facing an **unfounded charge** outside Canada; or
        - due to the judicial process in the foreign jurisdiction, it is unlikely that the applicant will **ever receive a trial**.
        - For any case where the charge against the individual will unlikely be dealt with (essentially resulting in the individual always being subject to this prohibition), and there exist compassionate grounds to override the prohibition, a waiver consideration may be warranted.
    - A person is prohibited from citizenship for **five years** if the person directly or indirectly **misrepresents** or withholds material circumstances relating to a relevant matter, which induces or could induce an error in the administration of the Act (s. 22(1)(e.1)(e.2))​.
        - There is **no *mens rea* or intent required** on behalf of the person to mislead (unlike revocation, which is discussed in Module 4)​. 
        - It is sufficient that the misrepresentation was material – it need not have prevented citizenship, as long as it affected the process or obfuscated a relevant avenue of inquiry. ​
        - **Indirect** misrepresentation made by third-party representatives count against applicant. ​
        - **Withholding** or omitting material circumstances counts (e.g., an unresolved criminal charge in foreign jurisdiction from many years in the past)

??? note "Time not counted"

    - When calculating physical presence, an applicant cannot count any time spent under **probation**, on **parole**, or serving a term of **imprisonment** (ss. 21(a)-(c))
    - However, the following notable exceptions may arguably apply:
        - **Time on probation as a result of a conditional discharge can count** toward physical presence if the probation was completed successfully (i.e., the applicant was not charged with a breach of probation or a failure to comply during that probation).
        - If the applicant received a **pardon/record suspension** for a conviction, time spent imprisoned, on parole, or on probation because of that conviction may be counted.
        - The prohibition may not count if the applicant was convicted under the **Youth Criminal** Justice Act (or previous Young Offenders Act) and successfully completed that sentence.
