??? note "Prohibitions"

    - **Conviction** for an indictable offense under an Act of Parliament leads to a **4 year** prohibition from applying for or being granted citizenship (s. 22(2))
    - **Two distinctions** from IRPA:
        - Prohibition runs from the date of the conviction, not the completion of the sentence
        - No deeming provision. Hybrid offenses are not automatically considered indictable. Election of Crown prosecutor, whether to pursue as indictable or summary charge, is dispositive under Act.
    - A **conviction** for a foreign offence that could be the equivalent of an indictable offence under an Act of Parliament leads to a **4 year** prohibition to being granted citizenship (s. 22(3)). The individual is also prohibited from citizenship while **serving** a sentence abroad for such an offence (19(1)(a.1)).
        - Recall the equivalency analysis under the IRPA s. 36(1)(b), (2)(b) studied in ICL 870​, the *Hill* approach. 
        - Unlike domestic criminality, it does not matter how the prosecutor treated the charge abroad or how it may have treated it in Canada. ​
        - Distinction from IRPA: **No discretion or H&C waiver** is possible under the Citizenship Act.
    - A person is prohibited from citizenship while **ongoing charge, trial, or appeal** for a foreign offence that could be the equivalent of an indictable offence under an Act of Parliament (see. 22(1)(b.1).)
    - A **discretionary waiver by Minister** is possible (s. 22(1.1)) and can possibly be used in cases such as:
        - the applicant is facing an **unfounded charge** outside Canada; or
        - due to the judicial process in the foreign jurisdiction, it is unlikely that the applicant will **ever receive a trial**.
        - For any case where the charge against the individual will unlikely be dealt with (essentially resulting in the individual always being subject to this prohibition), and there exist compassionate grounds to override the prohibition, a waiver consideration may be warranted.
    - A person is prohibited from citizenship for **five years** if the person directly or indirectly **misrepresents** or withholds material circumstances relating to a relevant matter, which induces or could induce an error in the administration of the Act (s. 22(1)(e.1)(e.2))​.
        - There is **no *mens rea* or intent required** on behalf of the person to mislead (unlike revocation, which is discussed in Module 4)​. 
        - It is sufficient that the misrepresentation was material – it need not have prevented citizenship, as long as it affected the process or obfuscated a relevant avenue of inquiry. ​
        - **Indirect** misrepresentation made by third-party representatives count against applicant. ​
        - **Withholding** or omitting material circumstances counts (e.g., an unresolved criminal charge in foreign jurisdiction from many years in the past)

??? note "Time not counted"

    - When calculating physical presence, an applicant cannot count any time spent under **probation**, on **parole**, or serving a term of **imprisonment** (ss. 21(a)-(c))
    - However, the following notable exceptions may arguably apply:
        - **Time on probation as a result of a conditional discharge can count** toward physical presence if the probation was completed successfully (i.e., the applicant was not charged with a breach of probation or a failure to comply during that probation).
        - If the applicant received a **pardon/record suspension** for a conviction, time spent imprisoned, on parole, or on probation because of that conviction may be counted.
        - The prohibition may not count if the applicant was convicted under the **Youth Criminal** Justice Act (or previous Young Offenders Act) and successfully completed that sentence.

??? note "Suspensions"

    - The Minister may **suspend** the processing of an application for as long as is necessary to receive any information or evidence or the results of any investigation or inquiry for the purpose of ascertaining whether the applicant meets the requirements of the Act or whether the applicant is or should be subject to an admissibility hearing or a removal order under IRPA (Citizenship Act, **s. 13.1**)​
    - Courts have found this provision provides the Minister broad latitude to suspend citizenship applications pending a variety of investigations (e.g. awaiting results of cessation proceedings, investigations into inadmissibility under the IRPA, and investigations of other people related to the applicant’s application for citizenship)​
    - However, Courts can “necessarily look at the **reasonableness** of the suspension and whether the suspension has been in effect for a longer time than is necessary.” In assessing when a suspension has become unreasonable, the Minister must provide the applicant and court some information on which to assess the reasonableness of a suspension. See: *Gentile v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2020 FC 452](https://canlii.ca/t/j8dwf){:target="\_blank"}
    - IRCC Webpage: [Suspending applications](https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canada.ca%2Fen%2Fimmigration-refugees-citizenship%2Fcorporate%2Fpublications-manuals%2Foperational-bulletins-manuals%2Fcanadian-citizenship%2Fadmininistration%2Fgeneral-file-processing%2Fprocedure-suspending-applications.html&data=05%7C01%7Cjam37%40queensu.ca%7C7bb5d112a91f433a1b1108dbdef21fed%7Cd61ecb3b38b142d582c4efb2838b925c%7C1%7C0%7C638348903726656244%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=JOCpttpLu85m7iGsKlFiO5KIY5wI4k7osi%2B%2BmwCjiSc%3D&reserved=0){:target="\_blank"}
        - Whenever an application is suspended, the officer would record this administrative action in a case note in GCMS.

??? note "Abandonment"

    - An application can be treated as abandoned when an applicant does not comply with **s. 23.1** by failing to provide requested documentation or information or to attend an event when requested, without a reasonable explanation (**s. 13.2**)​.
    - The IRCC policy states that at least **two notices** should be sent and an **additional 30 days** provided (on top of the 30 days already provided) before an application is declared abandoned. However, applicants and counsel should not rely on this as it is not required by the text of the Act.​
    - A reasonable explanation for a delay could potentially include documented medical condition, or evidence of having applied for the requested documentation (e.g. foreign police clearance) and waiting on the result. ​
    - Courts have held **explicit refusals** to provide further information or **bald claims of being unable to** provide further documentation can lead to abandonment declaration. There is no need for the Minister to assess the merits of the application based on what has already been provided, which is controversial because there is a difference between a negative decision and an abandonment. See: 
        - *Zhao v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2016 FC 207](https://canlii.ca/t/gngbw){:target="\_blank"}
        - *Kamel v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2017 FC 946](https://canlii.ca/t/hmnnn){:target="\_blank"}
    - Procedures: [Abandonment](https://can01.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.canada.ca%2Fen%2Fimmigration-refugees-citizenship%2Fcorporate%2Fpublications-manuals%2Foperational-bulletins-manuals%2Fcanadian-citizenship%2Fadmininistration%2Fgeneral-file-processing%2Fprocedure-abandonment.html&data=05%7C01%7Cjam37%40queensu.ca%7C7bb5d112a91f433a1b1108dbdef21fed%7Cd61ecb3b38b142d582c4efb2838b925c%7C1%7C0%7C638348903726812493%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=VUiGXlFHGhQ1T7oznPJYPyKRUItZR3Q33QvdExF1HXA%3D&reserved=0){:target="\_blank"}

??? note "Federal Court options"

    - A judicial review in Federal Court is available if an application is **refused**, declared **abandoned**, or another negative decision is made (e.g., denying medical or compassionate waiver)​
    - Judicial review must be applied for within **30 days** of negative decision (It's best to count from the date of the decision, not the receipt by the applicant or their counsel, so as to err on the side of caution).
    - ***Mandamus*** application is a request to the Federal Court to compel the Minister to perform a duty owed to the applicant. It's a possible option in cases where there has been significant delay without explanation or the application has been suspended for an inordinate amount of time. It requires a referral to a lawyer; see *Gentile v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2020 FC 452](https://canlii.ca/t/j8dwf){:target="\_blank"}.

## Quizzes

??? note "Module 3 Knowledge Check"

    1. For how many years is an individual prohibited from applying for citizenship after being convicted of an indictable offence under an Act of Parliament?
        - [ ] Four years after the completion of the sentence imposed
        - [x] **Four years after the date of conviction**
        - [ ] Five years after the date of conviction
        - [ ] Five years after the date of the offence
    > Pursuant to s. 22(2) of the Act, an individual must not have been convicted of an indictable offence in the **four years** prior to their application for citizenship. The **clock starts from the conviction date** not the date the sentence is compete, which is one important way the Citizenship Act differs from IRPA. 

    2. Vuong was convicted of an indictable criminal offence five years ago, for which he received a two-year term of imprisonment and is currently on probation. When can Vuong apply again for citizenship? 
        - [ ] Voung can apply now since it has been more than four years since the date of the his conviction. 
        - [ ] Vuong can only apply four years after the completion of his sentence.
        - [x] Vuong can apply when his probation is complete.
        - [ ] Vuong must first receive a pardon or record suspension.
    > While Vuong is prohibited from applying for citizenship **under s. 22(2) for four years** after the date of conviction, there is a separate prohibition to applying for citizenship **while still on probation or parole under s. 22(1)(a)** of the Act. Note also that unlike under IRPA, **a record suspension is not required in order to cure an inadmissibility for a Canadian conviction.** 

    3. Joel's citizenship application was recently refused based on a finding that he **misrepresented or withheld** material circumstances relating to a relevant matter, namely by failing to disclose a prior criminal conviction on his application. For how long is Joel prohibited from applying for citizenship? 
        - [x] Five years
        - [ ] Four years
        - [ ] Ten years
        - [ ] Until his criminal conviction his pardoned or received a record suspension
    > Pursuant to **s. 22(1)(e.2)** of the Act, an individual is prohibited from applying for citizenship for a period of **five (5) years** after their application is refused based on a finding of misrepresentation under **s. 22(1)(e.1)**. Note, this penalty is unrelated to any prohibition related to the criminal conviction itself in this case.  Note also that the **prohibition doubles to ten (10) years if the misrepresentation is discovered after citizenship has been granted and citizenship is revoked for that reason.** Therefore, the penalty differs depending on at what stage the misrepresentation is discovered and acted upon by IRCC.  

    4. Dina lived in Canada as a permanent resident for ten years working for Bell Canada. In 2014, she was sent abroad to Greece for a one-year work assignment. Unfortunately, upon returning to Canada in **2015**, she was convicted of a criminal offence by way of indictment and served a term of imprisonment of one year followed by one year parole. When, approximately, is the earliest she can apply for citizenship? 
        - [ ] 2019, four years after she was convicted
        - [ ] 2021, four years after she completed her sentence
        - [ ] 2020, four years after she completed her term of imprisonment
        - [x] 2020, assuming she has acquired three years (1095) days of residency in the last five-year period 
    > Dina's prohibition under s. 22(2) of the Act will expire four years after her conviction, by 2019. However, under s. 21, she cannot count her term of imprisonment or parole time (2015-2017) as part of her residency calculation. Accordingly, she must wait until at least 2020 to accumulate sufficient residency days, counting back five years not including her imprisonment and parole. 

    5. For how long can the Minister suspend a citizenship application to receive any information or evidence or the results of any investigation or inquiry for the purpose of ascertaining whether the applicant meets the requirements under the Act? 
        - [ ] For up to 6 months
        - [ ] As long as is reasonable
        - [x] **As long as is necessary**
        - [ ] Indefinitely
    > Under the prior version of the Act, the Minister could only suspend an application for up to 6 months under certain circumstances (see the cases of Stanizai and Magalong referenced in your readings). However, with the enactment of Bill C-24, s. 13.1 of the Act allows suspension "for as long as is necessary", which was intended to afford the Minister broad latitude and has been interpreted as such by the Courts. However, Courts have also held the language does **not allow indefinite suspension** as it must still be limited to some extent by what is reasonable in the circumstances (see *Gentile v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, 2020 FC 452).

    6. Jo-Ann recently received a negative decision on her citizenship application. She is seeking your advice as to her available options of appealing or challenging the decision. What option is available to her? 
        - [ ] She can file an appeal with IRCC to have the case considered by a Citizenship Judge.
        - [ ] She can file for judicial review in Federal Court within 15 days. 
        - [x] She can file for judicial review in Federal Court within 30 days. 
        - [ ] She can file an appeal with the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) of the IRB.  
    > Pursuant to **s. 22.1** of the Act, she has **30 days** to file for judicial review from the date she was notified or made aware of the decision (practically, counting from the date of the decision itself is the safest option unless there is a major discrepancy).  Note, that **this differs from the 15 days timeline under the IRPA and the two should not be conflated.**  There is **no appeal** option with the IRB. The IRB does not have jurisdiction over citizenship matters and there is no formal internal appeal with IRCC. While consultants do not practice in Federal Court it is important to know these possibilities and the timelines therefor so as to be able to properly advise clients of their available options. 

    7. Recently, Amir's counsel received a procedural fairness letter regarding Amir's citizenship application, which requested additional documents to corroborate Amir's residency. Amir has indicated that he does not have any further documents and directed his counsel to simply ignore the request and not respond within the 30 days provided or at all. Which of the following is the most likely outcome? 
        - [ ] Amir's application will be decided on the basis of the information and evidence available.
        - [ ] Amir's application will be refused. 
        - [ ] Amir's application will be suspended.
        - [x] Amir's application will be declared abandoned.  
    > Pursuant to **s. 13.2** of the Act, it is most likely Amir's application will be declared abandoned for failure to respond to the Minister in the time requested. Even if Amir responds but states that he is not providing the documents requested, the Minister may still declare the application abandoned unless Amir and his counsel provide a **sufficient reasonable justification for being unable to produce the documents at issue** (see *Zhao v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, 2016 FC 207). This is different and potentially worse than a refusal because the Minister will not attempt to make a decision as to residency based on the information and documents already provided, which could then be subject to judicial review on the reasonableness of the analysis. 

    8. Two years ago, Sally was convicted in Canada of a drug related offence punishable by way of indictment under the Criminal Code. Five months ago, Sally was charged in Ireland with a similar offence that if committed in Canada could constitute an indictable offence; the charge has yet to be adjudicated. Which of the following is true? 
        - [ ] Sally can apply for citizenship and ask the Minister for compassionate consideration to overcome her prior criminal history given that they were non-violent offences stemming from a drug addiction, for which she has since successfully completed an extensive rehabilitation program. 
        - [x] Sally can ask the Minister for compassionate consideration to overcome the charge in Ireland but not the Canadian conviction.
        - [ ] Sally can ask the Minister for compassionate consideration to overcome the Canadian conviction but not the charge in Ireland.
        - [ ] Sally cannot ask for any compassionate consideration under the Citizenship Act as s. 25 of the IRPA does not apply. 
    > Section **22(1.1)** of the Act specifically provides for **a potential waiver from the applicability of section 22(1)(b.1) on compassionate grounds.** This also serves to highlight how little discretion the minister is allowed with respect to the application of all other provisions regardless of any possible humanitarian factors and unlike the wide latitude afforded by s. 25 of IRPA.

    9. Joe applied for citizenship one year ago. At the time he submitted his application and when it was received by the IRCC, he was fully eligible for Canadian citizenship. His application was subsequently approved and he is scheduled to take his oath of citizenship next week. Yesterday, he was charged for robbery under s. 343 of the Criminal Code of Canada, but he has not yet been convicted or had his first hearing. Can Joe proceed to take the oath of citizenship as scheduled? 
        - [ ] Yes, because he was fully eligible for citizenship at the time his application was submitted and approved; it is therefore locked in. 
        - [ ] Yes, because he has only been charged and has not been convicted of any offence. 
        - [x] No, because he has been charged with an indictable offence under the Criminal Code. 
        - [ ] Yes, because the Minister may suspend his application but has not done so. 
    > Pursuant to **s. 22(6)** of the Act, **a person shall not take the oath of citizenship if they never met or they no longer meet the requirements for the grant of citizenship.** Section 22(b) prohibits anyone from citizenship who is not just convicted but also "while the person is charged with, on trial for, subject to or a party to an appeal" relating to an indicatable offence under an Act of Parliament.  

    10. Mark was convicted of a securities related offence in the United States two years ago, which could be treated as an indictable offence if committed in Canada. However, since that time, Mark was able to receive a full and unconditional Presidential Pardon, that completely sets aside the punishment for the federal crime. Assuming he meets all other requirements, is Mark now eligible to apply for Canadian citizenship? 
        - [ ] Yes, because he received a full foreign pardon that extinguished his conviction in the jurisdiction where he was convicted, further to the U.S. Constitution. 
        - [ ] No, because the Presidential Pardon is not the same as a Court expungement. 
        - [x] No, because he is prohibited regardless of whether he was pardoned or otherwise granted amnesty for the offence.
        - [ ] Yes, because the Presidential Pardon has the effect of erasing the conviction as it never existed. 
    > Further to **s. 22(3)** of the Act, and individual is prohibited from citizenship for a period of four years if the person has been convicted of an offence outside Canada that, if committed in Canada, would constitute an indictable offence under any Act of Parliament, **regardless of whether the person was pardoned or otherwise granted amnesty for the offence.** This is one of the ways in which the Citizenship Act differs and diverges from admissibility in the immigration context under the IRPA.
