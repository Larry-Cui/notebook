??? note "Minors - Two options for citizenship applications"

    - Application under s. 5(2). For Minors who are either:
        - Applying at the same time as a parent who is applying for a citizenship grant (**concurrent applications**); or
        - Already have a living parent (natural or adoptive) who is a Canadian citizen (**non-concurrent applications**).
        - For concurrent applications, the effective date of citizenship for minors under 14 years of age is the date the citizenship officer grants citizenship to the minor (after the parent has taken the Oath of Citizenship).
        - The effective date of citizenship for minors over 14 years of age, whether concurrent or non-concurrent application, is the date the minor takes and signs the oath of citizenship.
    - Application under s. 5(1).
        - **Under s 5 (1), minors can apply in the much the same way as an adult**; they must meet many of the same requirements, including **residency and tax requirements**.
        - Minors do not have to meet knowledge/language since only apply to those 18 - 54 years old.
        - The citizenship of a minor must be applied for on behalf of the minor by a person who has custody or allowed to act on their behalf (unless waived by the Minister).
        - Minors 14 - 17 must also counter-sign (i.e. co-sign) their application and take the Oath of Citizenship.
        - **Residency requirement can also be waived by Minister**
    - Advantage of **s. 5(2)**
        - Applications under s 5(2) can be more straightforward as they do not require a residency assessment. **They are based on the parent.**
    - Advantage of **s. 5(1)**
        - However, following Bill C-6 (2017), minors can now apply for citizenship without a Canadian parent, as the **age requirement for citizenship has been removed under subsection 5(1)**. Someone who is empowered to act on their behalf can apply for them the same as an adult.
        - This may be useful in myriad circumstances.
        - Residency requirements: If the minor has more residence in the Canada than the parents; for example, if they have spent time living with relatives in Canada or in boarding school while parents are abroad.
        - Criminality: Counsel may also consider this option if there are hurdles to obtaining the parents’ citizenship, such as a prohibition stemming from a prior criminal conviction or an active investigation. In certain circumstances, if minors have applied concurrently with parents under s 5(2) and application is suspended under s 13.1 of the Act because of parent, counsel may consider filing a separate application for the minors under s 5(1).
