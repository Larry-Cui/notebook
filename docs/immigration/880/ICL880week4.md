??? note "Revocation"

    - There are three related and overlapping bases for revocation under s. 10(1), if the individual obtained citizenship by:
        - Fraud
        - False representation
        - Knowingly concealing material circumstances
    - The **grounds** for revocation could have occurred at the time of applying for and obtaining citizenship or at the time of applying for permanent residence.
    - Previous grounds of revocation for national security offences committed after obtaining citizenship were **repealed** by Bill C-6 in 2017, but the IRCC website has not been updated.
    - **Burden of Proof**
        - It is the **Minister’s burden** to establish the required elements on a **balance of probabilities** (*Canada (MCI) v Halindintwali*, [2015 FC 390](https://canlii.ca/t/gkqq6){:target="\_blank"} at para. 32).
        - The balance of probabilities standard is satisfied if the evidence establishes that it is more probable than not that something occurred. That is, the Court must be satisfied that an event or fact in dispute is not only possible, but probable (*Rogan v Canada (MCI)*, [2011 FC 1007](https://canlii.ca/t/fmnhj){:target="\_blank"} [Rogan] at paras. 27-29.).
    - **Materiality**
        - A misrepresentation of a material fact includes an untruth, the withholding of truthful information, or a misleading answer which has the effect of foreclosing or averting further inquiries (*Canada v Brooks*, [1973 CanLII 5 (SCC)](https://canlii.ca/t/1nfn6){:target="\_blank"} at 873).
        - The **material character of the concealed facts** depends on “the significance for purposes of the decision in question of the information not disclosed” (*Odynsky*, [2001 FCT 138](https://canlii.ca/t/ppv){:target="\_blank"} at para. 156)
        - The Minister is **not required to prove** the false representation, fraud, or knowing concealment of material circumstances **would necessarily have led to the rejection of the application** for citizenship or permanent residence, but merely that it had the effect of foreclosing or averting further inquiries, even if those inquiries would not have necessarily led to a refusal (*Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Rogan*, [2011 FC 1007](https://canlii.ca/t/fmnhj){:target="\_blank"} at para. 31).
        - **Innocent misrepresentations are not to result in the revocation** of citizenship.” (*Canada v. Schneeberger*, [2003 FC 970](https://canlii.ca/t/1fx21){:target="\_blank"} at paras. 25-26; Rogan, [2011 FC 1007](https://canlii.ca/t/fmnhj){:target="\_blank"} at paras 32-35).
        - Likewise, the element of “materiality” does **not include inadvertent omissions** of immaterial information and mere technical transgressions. (*Canada (MCI) v Kljajic*, [2020 FC 570](https://canlii.ca/t/j6wf4){:target="\_blank"} at para. 95)
    - ***Mens Rea***
        - The Minister must have established the individual acted **intentionally** by deliberately concealing material circumstances or making false representations with the intent to mislead the decision-maker (*Canada (MCI) v Savic*, [2014 FC 523](https://canlii.ca/t/g7cd1){:target="\_blank"} at paras. 66-76). This ***mens rea*** applies equally to the current formulation of s. 10.1(1) (Canada (*Citizenship and Immigration) v Rubuga*, [2015 FC 1073](https://canlii.ca/t/gmlc8){:target="\_blank"} at para. 76)
        - This ***mens rea*** **differs from misrepresentation under section 22 (prohibition from applying for citizenship) of the Act or section 40 of IRPA**, which do not require intent to mislead and encompass even unintentional, inadvertent, or indirect misrepresentations.
        - In situations where a parent signs the application for a minor child, any allegation must pertain to the acts or omissions of the parent and thus, the child does not have to intend to mislead the decision-maker (*Canada (MCI) v Zakaria*, [2014 FC 864](https://canlii.ca/t/gdrm4){:target="\_blank"} at para. 84).
    - The step-by-step process
        - **Step 1:** A “Request for Information” letter is sent, including bare basics of the allegation and providing an opportunity to respond. It is a strategic decision whether to provide substantive submissions at this stage or wait for the formal Notice of Intent to Revoke Citizenship.
        - **Step 2:** A "Notice of Intent to Revoke Citizenship" is issued per the requirements set out in **s. 10(3)** of the Act. The Notice must set out the specific grounds and reasons for revocation, including reference to materials, on which the Minister is relying to make their decision.
            - The Notice of Intent is usually sent as comprehensive package containing all evidence the Minister relies upon for the allegation.
            - The citizen is given **60 days to respond**, but extensions can be granted.
        - **Step 3:** In response, the citizen has two options:
            - To **request that the Minister make the final decision** taking personal circumstances into consideration such as, but not limited to, the best interests of a child directly affected (s 10(3.1)). or
            - If not, the **default is that the citizen is entitled to a full hearing before Federal Court** on the merits of the allegation (s 10.1(1)). At the conclusion of the hearing, a judge of the Federal Court will decide whether the Minister has met the burden to prove their case on a balance of probabilities.
    - Note that the request for the Minister to make the final decision can include both arguments on the merits of the allegation (e.g. whether the facts in question were false or sufficiently material), as well a consideration of personal circumstances including an **H&C-type package** of compassionate submissions and supporting documents regarding establishment, best interests of the child, etc.
        - Note also that the exact scope of discretion and factors under consideration are currently in contention – see this week’s video with Laura Best and the recent decision in:  *Xu v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2021 FC 1248](https://canlii.ca/t/jkkth){:target="\_blank"}.
    - Consequences
        - A person under revocation proceedings remains entitled to all rights and privileges of Canadian citizenship (including passport and travel) until and if their citizenship is revoked.
        - If citizenship is revoked due to false representation or fraud or knowingly concealing material circumstances with respect to the citizenship application/process (e.g., lying about residence in Canada during the relevant period), **the person becomes a permanent resident as per s. 46(2) of IRPA**.
        - If citizenship is revoked on the grounds they became a permanent resident by false representation or fraud or knowingly concealed material circumstances, **the person will revert to foreign national status as per s. 46(2) of IRPA**.
        - In addition, following revocation, the person is **barred for 10 years from applying for citizenship** under s. 22(1)(f) of the Citizenship Act.

??? note "Renunciation and Resumption"

    - Under **s. 9(1)** of the Act, a Canadian citizen may **renounce** their citizenship if they:
        - are a citizen of a country other than Canada, or, if their application is accepted, will become a citizen of a country other than Canada
        - are not the subject of a declaration by the Governor in Council under section 20 (i.e. security declaration)
        - are not a minor
        - are not prevented from understanding the significance of renouncing citizenship by reason of having a mental disability, and
        - do not reside in Canada
    - A waiver in the discretion of the Minister is possible on compassionate grounds for two of the above requirements, namely:
        - that the applicant understand the significance of renouncing citizenship, and
        - that the applicant not reside in Canada
    - A former Canadian citizen may be granted resumption of citizenship under **s. 11** if they:
        - submit an application
        - were not the subject of an order made under section 10 (i.e. the person’s citizenship was not revoked)
        - are not subject to a declaration made under section 20 (i.e. security declaration)
        - are not prohibited
        - are not under a removal order
        - have become **a permanent resident** within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act after having ceased to be a Canadian citizen and have no unfulfilled conditions relating to their status as a permanent resident
        - have been physically present in Canada as a permanent resident for at least **365 days during the two years** immediately before the date of the application, and
        - met any applicable requirement under the Income Tax Act to file a return of income in respect of the **taxation year immediately before** the year in which the application is made

??? note "Review of Laura Best interview"

    - Part 1: Common issues and pitfalls on citizenship applications
        - What is the most common pitfall on citizenship applications? **Proving residency requirements**
        - What's a residency questionnaire? It’s a questionnaire from IRCC asking you to provide more evidence about your residency. If you provide sufficient evidence on residency requirements with the initial application, you’ll save time later, because you’ll skip this step.
    - Part 2: Latent admissibility issues
        - What are three most common types of latent admissibility issues that might be triggered by a citizenship application? **Criminality, cessation, and misrepresentation**
        - What is cessation? The RPD may determine that refugee protection has ceased if, for example, the refugee has voluntarily traveled back and reavailed themself of the protection of their country of nationality. See IRPA s 108 (2) for other reasons for cessation.
        - According to Best, what should counsel do if they discover a latent admissibility issue during the citizenship application process?
            - Be honest with your clients. You cannot misrepresent. You are ethically obligated by the professional code of conduct not to mispresent.
            - There are some cases (refugee cessation and criminality) where **time may resolve the issue**, if not “cure” it. Explore whether “waiting it out” may open the door to citizenship at a later date.
    - Part 3: Citizenship revocation
        - In what context/s can citizenship be revoked?
            - **Misrepresentation** on citizenship application
            - **Misrepresentation** on PR application, even if the citizenship application was accurate
            - **Misrepresentation** on refugee application
        - How does the revocation process work?
            - Step 1: IRCC is sending out a request for information letter. But these letters don’t attach the evidence on which reliance is made.
            - Step 2: IRCC sends out the official statutory notice with their case for revocation, evidence and a deadline for reply.
            - Step 3: If your client admits they committed a material misrepresentation, they can ask for the decision to be made under the Minister's discretion. You will need to provide reasons why the Minister should use this discretion. The factors are similar to **H&C: establishment, etc**.
        - What personal circumstances should the Minister consider?
            - It was not clear in Fall 2021. Three cases were at the Federal Court, where it was being decided whether circumstances in the country of origin, for example, are relevant. Two of those cases have been decided. See the following for updated information.
    - Addendum on citizenship revocation cases
        - *Xu v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2021 FC 1102](https://canlii.ca/t/jjs9c){:target="\_blank"}
            - In Xu, the Court found the Senior Analyst’s interpretation of paragraph 10(3.1)(a) of the Citizenship Act, such that the **consequences of removal are not considered** among the personal circumstances warranting special relief in all of the circumstances of the case was **reasonable**.
            - The Court agreed that a citizenship revocation decision has many **parallels to** the equitable humanitarian and compassionate considerations that are consider by the **IAD in misrepresentation cases** for permanent residents. (para. 62)
            - However, the Court found those **similarities do not extend to the consideration of ‘foreign hardship’ or the consequences of removal**, as the IAD hears the appeal of a removal order whereas a citizenship revocation decision renders the individual a foreign national, but does not automatically result in removal. (para. 64)
            - the Court notes that decision-makers in all misrepresentation cases **must consider** the **blameworthiness** of the individual, the **reasons** for the misrepresentation, and the **extenuating circumstances** thereof.
            - Likewise, the Court held it is **incorrect** to find **establishment based on misrepresentation can never be sufficient to warrant special relief**, owing simply to the fact the establishment would not have been possible but for the initial misrepresentation. Such reasoning is again circular. (para. 75)
        - *Gucake v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2022 FC 123](https://canlii.ca/t/jm637){:target="\_blank"}
            - In *Gucake*, the Court issued a briefer decision that again upheld the Minister’s Delegate’s finding that consideration of removal is premature at the citizenship revocation stage. (para 51)
