# Week 3: Competence and Scope of Practice

## Notes

??? note "Tutorial notes"

    - Case Study 1: Potential Misrepresentation
        - Group 1: What is the first point at which a competency issue arises in this scenario? Why, and what is the nature of the competency issue? 
        - Group 2: Upon first learning of the possible discrepancy, what steps should Karim have taken?   
        - Group 3: If Karim had properly assessed his own competence upon first learning of some incorrect information on the work permit forms, and concluded he was not competent to advise Josephine on the potential misrepresentation, what were his options under the Code?
        - Group 4:  Is the matter of advising Josephine about how to handle a potential misrepresentation inside or outside Karim's scope of licence? Is it inside or outside his scope of practice? Explain.
        - Group 5: Assume that Josephine has now informed Karim she is making a complaint to the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants. Does she have a legitimate complaint for breach of competency? Explain.
        - Group 6: If Josephine advises Karim that she intends to make a complaint to the College due to his mistakes, what are Karim’s obligations under the Code? What is the most relevant section?
    - Case Study 2: Criminal Inadmissibility
        - Groups 1 & 2: Is Jennie competent to accept this consultation?  What provisions of the Code are most applicable?
        - Groups 3 & 4: Sometimes it is possible to become competent on a matter quickly, and this is allowable if it can be done without unreasonable delay, risk or expense to the client.  Do you think it is feasible for Jennie to do some research to become competent quickly enough to advise Lorne? What impact does her own scope of practice have on the ability to become competent quickly?
        - Groups 5 & 6: With careful reference to the wording of sections 19(1), 20(1) and 20(2) of the Code, what should Jennie do in these circumstances if she concludes she is not competent to advise Lorne? Explain.

??? note "Competence and Client Service"

    - If consulted about a matter for which they lack the required competence, a consultant should:
        - **decline to act** and **refer** the client to a practitioner who is competent in that matter; *or*
        - obtain the client's instructions to **retain, consult, or collaborate with another licensed practitioner** who is competent in the matter.
    - Federal Court Decisions: Relief will sometimes be provided to the client (Applicant) where the incompetence is so serious as to amount to a lack of procedural fairness. However, the Applicant must also prove there is a reasonable probability (and not just speculation) that the **result would have been different** had the representative been competent.
    - It is important to know that licensed consultants must purchase **Errors and Omissions (E&O) insurance** annually for any inadvertent errors made in their practice.
    - When clients bring a successful claim against them for negligence or inadvertent errors or omissions, an insurance company lawyer will be appointed to represent the consultant. That is why you must **immediately notify the insurer** (**section 30** of the Code) of any possible claims so they may start advising you from the outset to attempt to resolve the issue as well as minimize the damage to the client and develop a legal strategy. 
    - Currently, E&O insurance is offered to licensees through **Acera Insurance** (formerly Smith Petrie Carr & Scott) and costs about **$200** per year. For more details, check out Smith Petrie Carr & Scott Insurance Brokers, "Key Questions about the CICC-CCIC Professional Liability Insurance Program" (last visited 20 August 2024), [online](https://www.spcs-ins.com/cicc-ccic-errors-and-omissions-coverage/){:target="\_blank"}.
    - The insurance does not cover the consultant or protect clients in the case of an RCIC’s **intentional fraud**. The same is true for lawyer’s insurance.
    - The licence issued to an RCIC by the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants (CICC) will be either a **Class L2-RCIC licence** or a **Class L3-RCIC-IRB licence**. The vast majority of current licensees have the L2-RCIC-Restricted Practice licence. As of July 1, 2023, RCICs cannot represent parties at the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) unless they hold the Class L3-RCIC-IRB licence.
    - **Graduates of the Queen’s GDipICL Program**, and its French counterpart, **will be issued the Class L3-RCIC-IRB – Unrestricted Practice licence** upon admission to the College. This is the most comprehensive licence the College can issue.
    - **“immigration or citizenship consulting services”** can be presumed to mean those services which require a licence for anyone charging the public, namely advice or representation about immigration or citizenship matters.
    - Licensed paralegals in Ontario have a specific scope of practice established by the LSO which allows them to undertake only certain types of work for the public. This includes court work in some matters and appearances before tribunals, including the IRB. See the Law Society of Ontario's [Q&A page on the "Paralegal Licensing Process"](https://lso.ca/becoming-licensed/paralegal-licensing-process/faqs#who-needs-a-licence--5.){:target="\_blank"} for more detail. **Paralegals who wish to advise or represent in all areas of IRPA and the Citizenship Act must become members of the College.**
    - **Section 91** of the **Immigration and Refugee Protection Act** prohibits anyone from charging fees directly or indirectly for advice on matters under IRPA. **Exceptions**, those who can charge, are identified in **section 91(2)** as: lawyers, other members of a law society (only Ontario paralegals at present), Quebec notaries, and members of the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants.
    - The only other exceptions, as per **sections 91(3) and (4)**, are articled students supervised by a lawyer and agencies authorized by the government under various agreements, such as the Visa Application Centres.
    - The **scope of practice** refers to the knowledge and experience an immigration consultant possesses to adequately advise or represent a client on a particular immigration-related matter. An individual licensee’s scope of practice will be determined by their actual competency as that concept is prescribed in section 19(2) of the Code of Professional Conduct.
    - Section **19(2)(a) of the Code** of Professional Conduct sets the bar for whether you are sufficiently competent enough to advise or represent a client on a matter.
        - 19(2) To fulfill their professional obligations competently, a licensee must
            - (a) have the knowledge and experience necessary to provide the required immigration or citizenship consulting services and offer sound and comprehensive advice to a client, including in-depth knowledge of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and the Citizenship Act and any related programs and policies;
    - In deciding whether you meet the above test, or can quickly become competent to do so, there are well-known standard factors relevant to making this **assessment** for the consultant to consider. These include:
        - the complexity and specialized **nature of the matter**
        - the consultant’s **general experience**
        - the consultant’s training and experience in the **particular subject** matter or legal issue
        - how related the current matter is to the consultant’s **past experience**
        - the **time**, preparation and study the consultant is able to give the matter
        - any delay caused to the client by the consultant’s **need to learn**
        - the **risk** to the client if not sufficiently competent
        - any **additional costs** to the client
        - whether it is **appropriate or feasible to refer** the matter to, or associate or consult with, a senior practitioner of established competence in the area in question. 
    - It follows from the above that the legal authorization to represent a client with respect to a certain matter, as determined by the practitioner’s scope of licence, is distinct from the competency to do so.
    - the College in late 2022 put in place a **Mentoring Program** which ran as a pilot until May 30, 2023 and became permanent thereafter. The Mentoring Program must be completed by all new licensees within the first year of their license.
    - Consequences of Incompetence:
        - The first and most immediate risk is that the client’s case may be **refused** solely due to the professional’s errors, which should never happen.
        - If the client can show their consultant’s incompetence was serious enough to  effectively be denied procedural fairness, the Court may set aside the officer’s decision – this means the client’s application is still alive, but at substantial **cost** and unnecessary **delay** to the client.
        - Third, the client may lodge a **complaint** to the College alleging the consultant has breached the competency requirements of the Code of Professional Conduct.
        - Finally, the client has the right to **sue the RCIC** in civil court for negligence, seeking monetary compensation for their losses incurred due to consultant’s incompetent assistance.
    - In the alternative, and with the client’s informed **consent**, it is acceptable for an RCIC who lacks the necessary competence in a matter to obtain **assistance** from another licensed practitioner as permitted in **sections 20(1)(b) and 20(2)** of the Code.  This is **not a referral**, as the RCIC continues to remain involved and both professionals will handle the matter for the client in the manner agreed upon. In this case, **both practitioners retain all professional obligations towards the client**.
    - A referral is where the RCIC refers the matter to another licensed professional and is no longer involved. It can be a referral of the entire matter, or, sometimes a narrower issue can be referred.
    - The major qualities that make up emotional intelligence are: **self-awareness**, **mood management**, **self-motivation**, **impulse control** and **people skills**, which are all qualities that can be developed during life and professional work.
