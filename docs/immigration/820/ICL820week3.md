# Week 3: Competence and Scope of Practice

## Notes

??? note "Tutorial notes"

    - Case Study 1: Potential Misrepresentation
        - Group 1: What is the first point at which a competency issue arises in this scenario? Why, and what is the nature of the competency issue? 
            - doesn't have experience in misrep
            - was first informed of mis-rep/PFL
            - s 19(2)(a)
        - Group 2: Upon first learning of the possible discrepancy, what steps should Karim have taken?   
            - get the facts and docs so he can clarify the situation
            - decide if he's competent
            - would he assess himself as being competent? NO
        - Group 3: If Karim had properly assessed his own competence upon first learning of some incorrect information on the work permit forms, and concluded he was not competent to advise Josephine on the potential misrepresentation, what were his options under the Code?
            - decline
            - s 20(1) cease to act or get assistance
            - terminate as 35(1)(d), actions under s 36
        - Group 4:  Is the matter of advising Josephine about how to handle a potential misrepresentation inside or outside Karim's scope of licence? Is it inside or outside his scope of practice? Explain.
            - outside, because this is likely to be a judicial review.
            - should Karim refer the case to a lawyer? Yes.
            - Why not work with a lawyer? not in the bests interests of the client.
        - Group 5: Assume that Josephine has now informed Karim she is making a complaint to the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants. Does she have a legitimate complaint for breach of competency? Explain.
            - Yes, s 19(2)(a)
        - Group 6: If Josephine advises Karim that she intends to make a complaint to the College due to his mistakes, what are Karim’s obligations under the Code? What is the most relevant section?
            - s 30(1)
    - Case Study 2: Criminal Inadmissibility
        - Groups 1 & 2: Is Jennie competent to accept this consultation?  What provisions of the Code are most applicable?
            - safest: decline per s19(1)
            - why not get help? it is not in Lorne's interests for Jennie to participate for her own learning purposes.
        - Groups 3 & 4: Sometimes it is possible to become competent on a matter quickly, and this is allowable if it can be done without unreasonable delay, risk or expense to the client.  Do you think it is feasible for Jennie to do some research to become competent quickly enough to advise Lorne? What impact does her own scope of practice have on the ability to become competent quickly?
            - High stake, time restriction
            - what factor are important in deciding if you can do some research to become competent quickly?
                - Nature of case: complexity
                - own knowledge and experience in the particular area
                - related experience
                - risk of misrepresentation
                - timeliness
                - delay in becoming
                - importance to the client
            - Think from Lorne's point
        - Groups 5 & 6: With careful reference to the wording of sections 19(1), 20(1) and 20(2) of the Code, what should Jennie do in these circumstances if she concludes she is not competent to advise Lorne? Explain.
            - No！ Lorne is not a client.
            - not in Lorne's interest to hire two consultants.
    - How can NEW RCICs get experience then? internship, work at a company, *pro bono*

??? note "Competence and Client Service"

      - If consulted about a matter for which they lack the required competence, a consultant should:
          - **decline to act** and **refer** the client to a practitioner who is competent in that matter; *or*
          - obtain the client's instructions to **retain, consult, or collaborate with another licensed practitioner** who is competent in the matter.
      - Federal Court Decisions: Relief will sometimes be provided to the client (Applicant) where the incompetence is so serious as to amount to a lack of procedural fairness. However, the Applicant must also prove there is a reasonable probability (and not just speculation) that the **result would have been different** had the representative been competent.
      - It is important to know that licensed consultants must purchase **Errors and Omissions (E&O) insurance** annually for any inadvertent errors made in their practice.
      - When clients bring a successful claim against them for negligence or inadvertent errors or omissions, an insurance company lawyer will be appointed to represent the consultant. That is why you must **immediately notify the insurer** (**section 30** of the Code) of any possible claims so they may start advising you from the outset to attempt to resolve the issue as well as minimize the damage to the client and develop a legal strategy. 
      - Currently, E&O insurance is offered to licensees through **Acera Insurance** (formerly Smith Petrie Carr & Scott) and costs about **$200** per year. For more details, check out Smith Petrie Carr & Scott Insurance Brokers, "Key Questions about the CICC-CCIC Professional Liability Insurance Program" (last visited 20 August 2024), [online](https://www.spcs-ins.com/cicc-ccic-errors-and-omissions-coverage/){:target="\_blank"}.
      - The insurance does not cover the consultant or protect clients in the case of an RCIC’s **intentional fraud**. The same is true for lawyer’s insurance.
      - The licence issued to an RCIC by the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants (CICC) will be either a **Class L2-RCIC licence** or a **Class L3-RCIC-IRB licence**. The vast majority of current licensees have the L2-RCIC-Restricted Practice licence. As of July 1, 2023, RCICs cannot represent parties at the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) unless they hold the Class L3-RCIC-IRB licence.
      - **Graduates of the Queen’s GDipICL Program**, and its French counterpart, **will be issued the Class L3-RCIC-IRB – Unrestricted Practice licence** upon admission to the College. This is the most comprehensive licence the College can issue.
      - **“immigration or citizenship consulting services”** can be presumed to mean those services which require a licence for anyone charging the public, namely advice or representation about immigration or citizenship matters.
      - The five classes of licence are set out in section 10.1 of the By-laws of the College (formerly the Council) as follows:
          - 10.1 Classes of Licence - The Council shall have the following classes of licence:
              - (a) Class L1 - RCIC – Conditional Practice;
              - (b) Class L2 – RCIC – Restricted Practice;
              - (c) Class L3 – RCIC-IRB – Unrestricted Practice;
              - (d) Class L4 – RISIA – Conditional Practice; and
              - (e) Class L5 – RISIA – Unrestricted Practice
          <br>Source: College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants, ["By-Laws, Regulations and Policies," (17 November 2021) [section 10.1 of the By-laws]](https://college-ic.ca/about-the-college/regulations-and-policies/By-laws){:target="\_blank"} .
      - "Since the scope of the Class L3-RCIC-IRB licence is unrestricted, it allows an RCIC to charge for advice and representation in any matter falling under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, including all matters before all divisions of the Immigration and Refugee Board, as well as any matter under the Citizenship Act. In terms of the College’s authority granted under the College Act, this is the broadest possible scope of licence, i.e., the broadest possible scope of services an RCIC can provide." onQ [link](https://onq.queensu.ca/d2l/le/content/938607/viewContent/5582869/View){:target="\_blank"}.
      - Licensed paralegals in Ontario have a specific scope of practice established by the LSO which allows them to undertake only certain types of work for the public. This includes court work in some matters and appearances before tribunals, including the IRB. See the Law Society of Ontario's [Q&A page on the "Paralegal Licensing Process"](https://lso.ca/becoming-licensed/paralegal-licensing-process/faqs#who-needs-a-licence--5.){:target="\_blank"} for more detail. **Paralegals who wish to advise or represent in all areas of IRPA and the Citizenship Act must become members of the College.**
      - **Section 91** of the **Immigration and Refugee Protection Act** prohibits anyone from charging fees directly or indirectly for advice on matters under IRPA. **Exceptions**, those who can charge, are identified in **section 91(2)** as: lawyers, other members of a law society (only Ontario paralegals at present), Quebec notaries, and members of the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants.
      - The only other exceptions, as per **sections 91(3) and (4)**, are articled students supervised by a lawyer and agencies authorized by the government under various agreements, such as the Visa Application Centres.
      - The **scope of practice** refers to the knowledge and experience an immigration consultant possesses to adequately advise or represent a client on a particular immigration-related matter. An individual licensee’s scope of practice will be determined by their actual competency as that concept is prescribed in section 19(2) of the Code of Professional Conduct.
      - Section **19(2)(a) of the Code** of Professional Conduct sets the bar for whether you are sufficiently competent enough to advise or represent a client on a matter.
          - 19(2) To fulfill their professional obligations competently, a licensee must
              - (a) have the knowledge and experience necessary to provide the required immigration or citizenship consulting services and offer sound and comprehensive advice to a client, including in-depth knowledge of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and the Citizenship Act and any related programs and policies;
      - In deciding whether you meet the above test, or can quickly become competent to do so, there are well-known standard factors relevant to making this **assessment** for the consultant to consider. These include:
          - the complexity and specialized **nature of the matter**
          - the consultant’s **general experience**
          - the consultant’s training and experience in the **particular subject** matter or legal issue
          - how related the current matter is to the consultant’s **past experience**
          - the **time**, preparation and study the consultant is able to give the matter
          - any delay caused to the client by the consultant’s **need to learn**
          - the **risk** to the client if not sufficiently competent
          - any **additional costs** to the client
          - whether it is **appropriate or feasible to refer** the matter to, or associate or consult with, a senior practitioner of established competence in the area in question. 
      - It follows from the above that the legal authorization to represent a client with respect to a certain matter, as determined by the practitioner’s scope of licence, is distinct from the competency to do so.
      - the College in late 2022 put in place a **Mentoring Program** which ran as a pilot until May 30, 2023 and became permanent thereafter. The Mentoring Program must be completed by all new licensees within the first year of their license.
      - Consequences of Incompetence:
          - The first and most immediate risk is that the client’s case may be **refused** solely due to the professional’s errors, which should never happen.
          - If the client can show their consultant’s incompetence was serious enough to  effectively be denied procedural fairness, the Court may set aside the officer’s decision – this means the client’s application is still alive, but at substantial **cost** and unnecessary **delay** to the client.
          - Third, the client may lodge a **complaint** to the College alleging the consultant has breached the competency requirements of the Code of Professional Conduct.
          - Finally, the client has the right to **sue the RCIC** in civil court for negligence, seeking monetary compensation for their losses incurred due to consultant’s incompetent assistance.
      - In the alternative, and with the client’s informed **consent**, it is acceptable for an RCIC who lacks the necessary competence in a matter to obtain **assistance** from another licensed practitioner as permitted in **sections 20(1)(b) and 20(2)** of the Code.  This is **not a referral**, as the RCIC continues to remain involved and both professionals will handle the matter for the client in the manner agreed upon. In this case, **both practitioners retain all professional obligations towards the client**.
      - A referral is where the RCIC refers the matter to another licensed professional and is no longer involved. It can be a referral of the entire matter, or, sometimes a narrower issue can be referred.
      - The major qualities that make up emotional intelligence are: **self-awareness**, **mood management**, **self-motivation**, **impulse control** and **people skills**, which are all qualities that can be developed during life and professional work.

## Quizzes

??? note "Module 3: Knowledge Check"

    1. Sergio represents Vladimir Zegrovtich who was approved as a Manitoba nominee. Vladimir is now being screened for admissibility by IRCC.  He served as a high-ranking officer in the Serbian army during the Bosnian war, all of which is disclosed on his military history form.   IRCC sent a procedural fairness letter alleging Vladimir may be inadmissible for human or international rights violations under s. 35 of IRPA due to his military history. He has 30 days to respond.   Sergio responds with more explanations from the client doing his best as this is his first s. 35 case.  The application is refused for inadmissibility.  At what point in time should Sergio have recognized his own lack of competency?
        - [ ] At the initial consultation
        - [x] Upon completing the forms answering the military questions.
        - [ ] Upon receiving the procedural fairness letter.
        - [ ] Upon getting the refusal.
        <br>Correct. Answering questions about military history of an officer from a war-torn region with known human rights abuses raises issues of competency, ie knowing the impact of the client's military role.

    2. There are many standard ways for a consultant to gain competence in a potential new area of practice.  However, other strategies for acquiring competency in a new area should be avoided.  A poor way to learn to apply for an LMIA (Labour Market Impact Assessment), a complex application, would be through:
        - [ ] referring the LMIA to an experienced practitioner to represent, while you work on it pro bono to learn.
        - [ ] when you have opportunity to take your first case, inform the the client you will find co-counsel to assist as per s 20(1)(b).
        - [x] taking seminars and researching as much as possible.
        - [ ] finding an experienced RCIC to jointly take on the file with you.
        <br>This is not an effective way to learn LMIAs. Seminars and research can suffice in areas that are an adjunct to your current practice but are unlikely to make you competent in a major new specialized area. Remember, you need experience as well as knowledge.

    3. The scope of an RCIC's licence will be determined by the class of licence they are granted by the licensing body.  The licensing body, in the case of immigration consultants, is the College.  **The College's legal authority to grant and revoke licences is established by**:
        - [ ] section 91(1)(c) of IRPA.
        - [x] the ***College Act***.
        - [ ] section 21.1(2)(c) of the Citizenship Act.
        - [ ] the Board of Directors of the College.
        <br>Correct. The College and its mandate are established under the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants Act, S.C. 2019, c 29, s 292 (the College Act).  Section 2 defines the maximum scope of a licence of an immigration and citizenship consultant, and the College can and does also issue restricted licences.

    4. Peter is an immigration consultant in Calgary and has worked in the field for 20 years.   Before that, he was an immigration officer with IRCC for 10 years, mostly assigned to H&C cases.  For the past two decades his practice has largely focused on corporate immigration and foreign workers, namely employment-related immigration.  Which type of case is most likely outside Peter's scope of practice?
        - [ ] The City of Calgary's request to hire an architect if he has never processed an architect.
        - [ ] A humanitarian and compassionate case on medical grounds.
        - [x] A refugee case.
        - [ ] All of the above.
        <br>Correct.  He has never worked in this area and has only limited knowledge. It is a complex area, which is not easy to learn quickly by reading when you have no background or experience. He would not be competent.

    5. Claire Lavoie, an RCIC working in Newfoundland, specializes in obtaining permanent residence for foreign workers and their families.  She is representing a USA citizen, Hans Heinen, who qualifies in the Canadian Experience Class.   Claire sent Hans her standard questionnaire to fill out with all the information needed for the forms and process. He replied "None" so Claire took his case. However, when his FBI  certificate came back, he had a conviction for DUI in Idaho in 2014 with a minor penalty.   This raises several issues for Claire, as she does not feel competent to advise him on the impact of the criminal record.  Claire might have avoided this situation by:
        - [ ] not taking the case.
        - [ ] insist Charles get his FBI  certificate before entering into a service agreement.
        - [x] a more robust screening process regarding criminal records.
        - [ ] it was probably not avoidable.
        <br>Correct.  Given the consequences of any past criminal charges to the case, more upfront steps are needed to avoid this situation, such as more detailed questions; the phrase "criminal record" is open to interpretation and does not reflect the exact questions on immigration forms; more specificity and probing is needed.

    6. Alice Huang is preparing a family class sponsorship for a Canadian citizen who is sponsoring her husband Francois Gerard for permanent residence.  When Francois' police certificate came back, it showed a conviction for theft in Paris in 2006.  Francois is adamant he has no criminal record and it must be a case of mistaken identity.  This is Alice's first encounter with this problem.   As a first step, her best course of action is to:
        - [ ] submit the record to IRCC with an explanation about mistaken identity and see what happens.
        - [ ] insist the client own up to it otherwise she will not represent them.
        - [x] seek the client's permission to discuss the record with a colleague knowledgeable about French police certificates.
        - [ ] cease representing the client.
        <br>Correct.  This is permitted under s 20(1)(b), and a sensible first step as it is possible there is a known issue, or process to pursue or a simple solution. The client's consent is needed due to the likely necessity to use names.

    7. Immigration consultants are not permitted to provide any immigration advice or services outside the scope of their RCIC licence. Which of the following matters would be outside the scope of an RCIC's licence?
        - [ ] Asking an immigration officer to re-consider a study permit refusal.
        - [ ] Making a citizenship application for a child born abroad.
        - [x] Advising an unsuccessful applicant on the merits of judicial review in Federal Court.
        - [ ] Exploring options for a foreign worker is who is out of status.
        <br>Correct – Advising on any Federal Court matters is outside the scope on any RCIC licence.

    8. An RCIC who receives an email from a potential client requesting help with a sponsorship appeal when they do not work in that area may take the following action:
        - [ ] forward the email to a colleague who does these appeals.
        - [x] ask the potential client if they would like a referral.
        - [ ] contact a capable colleague to see if they would pay a referral fee for the case.
        - [ ] **tell the client you do not work in this area but could learn it if desired, as it is within the scope of your licence**.
        <br>Although honest, you cannot learn a whole new complex area of practice this way, and so are not competent to enter a service agreement for it

    9. Johan is a new practitioner who recently opened his office in Brandon, Manitoba, hoping to build up his practice in employment immigration. He has been conducting outreach to numerous companies in the agricultural sector across western Canada offering to provide services.  Johan took on a case for a Saskatchewan hog producer, not realizing the province has additional requirements for representatives bringing foreign workers to that province, which credentials he does not have and cannot quickly obtain. Therefore, he was not competent to take this case.  The most specific provision of the Code regarding this type of incompetence is:
        - [ ] section 19(1).
        - [ ] section 19(2)(f).
        - [x] section 19(2)(c).
        - [ ] none of the above.
        <br>Correct – this is specific to provincial licensing requirements which Johan was unaware of.

    10. IRCC is increasingly moving to online applications, using numerous platforms and digital processes.  Part of being competent means that immigration consultants must have appropriate and effective technology for delivering services.  The most relevant provision in the Code which requires this is:
        - [x] section 19(2)(e).
        - [ ] section 22(1)(b).
        - [ ] section 22(2).
        - [ ] section 22(1)(e).
        <br>Correct – this addresses technology specifically as a competency issue
