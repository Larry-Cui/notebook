# Week 4: Conflicts of Interest

## Notes

??? note "Tutorial notes"

      - Case 1: Discussion Questions
          - Groups 1 & 2: Assuming that Jacques may be unable to come to Canada due to his inadmissibility, consider the impacts on (1) the company and (2) Carly. In light of these, what office procedures might Carly adopt to reduce the possibility of being in this situation in the future?
          - Groups 3 & 4: Using the definition of “conflict of interest” in section 1(2) of the Code, would you say that Carly’s situation, at the point where she pulls out the Code, amounts to an actual conflict of interest or a potential conflict of interest?  Explain. What is her immediate next step and why? Your answer should include who her clients are, and what role confidentiality plays in this scenario.
          - Groups 5 & 6: Sections 5, 6, 15(1), and 28(3) of the Code all bear on this scenario. Carly’s plan will necessarily depend on whether Jacques is willing to disclose this offence to the company. Either way (if Jacques will not disclose; if Jacques will disclose) can you devise a plan in each case for Carly that would fulfill her duties to both parties?  Be specific.
      - Case 2: Family Involvement
          - Groups 1 & 2: At the time when Samesh first retained Raj, did Raj have an actual conflict of interest? Was there a potential conflict of interest? Explain your answer with reference to the facts and the definition of “conflict of interest” in section 1(2) of the Code.
          - Groups 3 & 4: Using the definition of “conflict of interest” in section 1(2) of the Code, describe the nature of the conflict of interest that Raj now has on this file after Devinder fired Samesh. Your answer should take into account the status of Raj and Devinder under the Code and Raj’s Code obligations.
          - Groups 5 & 6: A client in this situation may desperately want Raj to continue – they may not know anyone else and have no income to hire someone. Considering ss 15(1) and 15(2), is this a situation where Raj could have Samesh consent in writing for Raj continue to be his Representative despite the conflict of loyalties Raj faces between the interests of Samesh and Devinder? Explain your answer.

??? note "Conflicts of Interest"

      - A conflict of interest is a situation in which **your duty of loyalty to the client** or the representation of the client can be **adversely affected by**:
          -  your own interests, or
          -  your duties to another client (a current, former or joint client) or
          -  the interests of a third party such as a family member of your client
      - Even a **perceived conflict** is sufficient to impede the relationship and violate your duties under the Code of Professional Conduct.
      - [Xiao v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)](https://canlii.ca/t/jl62z){:target="\_blank"}, 2021 FC 1360.
          - According to IRCC’s guidelines for submitting a Family Class sponsorship application, an application is considered to be “made” at the time IRCC receives the complete application. The age of the dependent child is therefore **“locked-in” when IRCC receives an application**. (para 32)
          - However, where the incompetence or negligence of the applicant’s representative is sufficiently specific and clearly supported by the evidence **such negligence or incompetence is inherently prejudicial to the applicant and will warrant overturning the decision**, notwithstanding the lack of bad faith or absence of a failure to do anything on the part of the tribunal. (para 39)
          - The Applicant contends that by continuing to act for the Applicant in the appeal before the IAD, the Consultant placed himself in a **conflict of interest** with the Applicant. The Applicant argues that the **Consultant’s self-interest** was to not admit any error on his part and continue to make un-meritorious arguments, while the **Applicant’s interest** was to explain that she suffered a miscarriage of justice due to the Consultant’s error. (para 45)
          - See [paragraph 53](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2021/2021fc1360/2021fc1360.html#53){:target="\_blank"} of the decision explaining the rationale for the duty to recommend the client seek legal advice once you realize you have made an error prejudicing their case – this obligation is required by section 30(1)(b) of the Code of Professional Conduct for the very reasons that arose in this case.

      - **JOINT RETAINER AGREEMENTS:** The relevant provisions affecting joint clients can be found in sections 6.1 through 6.4 of the Retainer Agreement Regulation as follows:
          - 6.1 Before agreeing to represent more than one Client in a matter, a Licensee shall advise the Clients that: (a) Clients being simultaneously represented by a Licensee on a common matter should agree that the Licensee may **share information** among all Clients as required; and (b) if a **conflict** between Clients develops and cannot be resolved, the Licensee cannot continue to represent all Clients, and may have to **withdraw as the Client’s representative for one or all Clients**.
          - 6.2 If a Licensee has a continuing relationship with one Client for whom they act regularly before agreeing to act for that Client and another Client in a matter, the Licensee shall advise the other Client of the **continuing relationship**.
          - 6.3 Although all parties concerned may consent, a Licensee shall avoid acting for more than one Client if it is likely that **an issue contentious** between them will arise or their interests, rights, or obligations will diverge as the matter progresses.
          - 6.4 Where there is more than one Client, **both Clients must date and sign** the Joint Retainer Agreement
      - *Code*:
          - **Section 1(2)(a)** – Defines the conflict of interest where your own private interests or a third party’s interests (such as your spouse, friend or business partner) conflict with your client’s interests
          - **Section 1(2)(b)** – Defines the conflict of interest where the interests of another client or former client conflict with the interests of an existing client
          - **Section 5** – The duty of loyalty includes the duty to avoid conflicts of interest [as defined in s 1(2)]
          - **Section 15(1)** – Main rule regarding conflicts of interest: Not provide services in cases of actual or potential conflicts ("would or could result in a conflict of interest") unless....
          - **Section 15(1)** – An exception is where written disclosure of the details of the conflict or potential conflict is made to all parties and they give free and informed consent in writing for you to act for them
          - **Section 15(1)** – “Subject to sections 16 to 18” means that the rules in sections 16, 17 or 18 will take precedence where they apply; in other words, the disclosure and written consent referred to in section 15(1) will not suffice in the situations described in sections 16, 17 or 18, as more rules apply
          - **Section 15(2)(a)** – Disclosure and written consent will also not suffice where a reasonable person would think you could not be objective regarding your client’s interest, or develop the necessary trust with the client
          - **Section 15(2)(b)** – Disclosure and written consent will not suffice where a reasonable person would think you would necessarily have to compromise the confidentiality of any client or former client
          - Section 16 – Unauthorized behaviours – the situations in 16(1)(a), (b) and (c) are deemed to be conflicts of interest, and cannot be consented to by the client with the one exception set out in 16(2)
          - **Section 16(1)(a)** – No borrowing money from, or lending money to a client, directly or indirectly
          - **Section 16(1)(b)** – No additional services or arrangements outside of immigration services may be offered directly or indirectly to clients (such as employment, real estate sales or insurance services) except as per 16(2)
          - **Section 16(1)(c)** – No intimate relationships with the client for one year after services have ended, unless the services are for your spouse or common-law partner (‘conjugal relationship for at least one year’)
          - **Section 16(2)** – Additional transactions outside of immigration services are permitted, despite16(1)(b), if three conditions are met: the client consents; the terms are fair and reasonable; and the client confirms in writing they obtained independent advice about the transaction
          - **Section 17(1)** – Employment recruitment services defined in a unique way for Code purposes
          - **Section 17(2)** and (3) – Conditions applicable where the RCIC is advising or representing both the employer and the foreign worker
          - **Section 18(1)** – Student recruitment defined in a unique way for Code purposes
          - **Section 18(2) and (3)** – Conditions applicable when the RCIC is advising or representing both the education institution and the foreign student
          - **Section 24(3)(o)** - The service agreement must identify any actual or potential conflict of interest and describe the manner of dealing with it, for example, any special terms applicable to joint clients

## Quizzes

???+ note "Module 4: Knowledge Check - Conflicts of Interest"

    1. A conflict of interest can be best described as a conflict of:
        -  [ ] instructions
        -  [ ] workload
        -  [ ] timelines
        -  [x] **loyalties**
        > Correct. Aspects of the duty of loyalty include the commitment to the client's cause, honesty and candour as well as confidentiality.  The rules protect all these duties from impairment due to conflicting interests.  See section 5.

    2. A start-up visa is a unique visa available to innovative companies, usually in the high-tech sector, allowing them to obtain faster work permits to relocate a few key employees simultaneously to start-up a business in Canada.   An immigration consultant wishing to represent three such employees on the same application under this program must consider that this situation:
        - [ ] constitutes an actual conflict of interest.
        - [ ] requires independent legal advice for the 3 applicants.
        - [x] constitutes a **potential conflict** of interest for the reason that the RCIC has three joint clients on the application.
        - [ ] requires verbal consent of the 3 applicants.
        > Correct – joint clients on the same application always give rise to a potential conflict of interest, and their written authorization is required to receive services as joint clients, waiving confidentiality between them

    3. Some conflicts of interest can be managed and some conflicts are absolutely prohibited.  Which situation below is a conflict of interest that would be absolutely prohibited under the Code?
        - [ ] Representing the sponsor and their spouse at an IAD hearing.
        - [ ] Your fees being paid by the client's uncle.
        - [ ] Providing both immigration and employment recruitment services.
        - [x] Dating a current client.
        > Correct. There is an absolute prohibition on this conflict of interest which cannot be consented to by the client – see s 16(1)(c).

    4. A consultant must avoid situations where their personal interests may come into conflict with a client's interests. This may occur, for example, when the consultant buys into the client's business. Such situations are to be avoided because:
        - [x] the consultant's financial interests may impede the duty of loyalty owed to client.
        - [ ] the client may be vulnerable.
        - [ ] they are strictly prohibited under the Code.
        - [ ] all of the above.

    5. Under the Code of Professional Conduct, different types of conflicts of interest must be managed in different ways. Some conflicts can be managed with full disclosure and informed consent. Other types of conflicts require the client to obtain independent advice first, which must be confirmed in writing to the RCIC. In applying the Code, which of these situations would require the client to get independent advice?
        - [ ] The client is a foreign student asking you to apply for her study permit after you recruited her for Brenton College where you work as an education agent.
        - [x] Your spouse owns a travel agency, and wants to hire your client as receptionist.
        - [ ] Your client seeks investment advice and you recommend a well-known investment company that you use but have no personal involvement in.
        - [ ] You obtained an LMIA for an employer and the worker wants you to represent him on the work permit.
        > Correct as per s 16(1)(b) and 16(2) as this is an additional transaction which you cannot undertake indirectly (ie through your spouse) unless the terms are fair and reasonable and the client obtains independent advice on the transaction.

    6. Jaspreet focusses her RCIC practice on recruiting foreign students from the Punjab in India.  She is not officially an education agent for any college or university but helps potential students to find the right education institution and program of study in any part of Canada that best suits their needs.  Once a program is identified, Jaspreet helps them with the forms and process to enroll in the specific program.  If they receive an acceptance letter for the program of study, Jaspreet represents them to apply for a  study permit.  She charges $800 for the services up until the student receives an acceptance letter from the school, and $2000 for the study permit.  Under section 18 of the Code, is this practice permissible?
        - [ ] Yes, provided she is transparent with the student in the service agreement.
        - [ ] Yes, as long as she keeps the fees fair and reasonable.
        - [ ] No, as finding a school and assisting with enrollment is outside her scope of licence.
        - [x] No, as she is not allowed to charge for finding a school and enrollment.
        > She is considered to be providing recruitment services as defined in **s 18(1) so all the conditions in 18(3) apply, including not charging for recruitment**.

    7. Oluwapelelumi (“Olu”) is an RCIC in Moncton, New Brunswick who brings in foreign workers to the Atlantic region in the health care sector. Triston Health Solutions hired her to obtain a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) for ten long-term care workers.  There were numerous problems along the way, but Olu has finally filed the LMIA application with Service Canada. The company has now contacted Olu to say they waited until their LMIA was filed to save time but are very unhappy with her services. They wish to cancel the service agreement with Olu. They have already found a lawyer across town and want their file transferred to her.  Plus, they do not want to pay the $2000 still owing.  In this situation, Olu should:
        - [ ] require the outstanding payment be made before she will transfer the file.
        - [x] terminate the service agreement and transfer the file regardless of payment.
        - [ ] explain why this is not in in their best interests and recommend they get independent advice first.
        - [ ] terminate and transfer the file if they will pay an additional discharge fee for her time.
        > **35(1)(a) and 36(2) and (3)**

    8. As a consultant, you should avoid situations where your private interests will likely come into conflict with a client's interests. Examples include investing in the client's business, hiring the client as staff, or arranging with a relative to employ your client. These relationships are problematic because:
        - [x] you are wearing two hats, which divides your loyalties.
        - [ ] the regulatory body prohibits such transactions.
        - [ ] it is impossible to maintain client confidentiality.
        - [ ] All of the above.

    9. Your firm has just been retained for a Start-Up Visa application by a robotics company.  Three business partners from Germany are seeking work permits to start up their company in Canada, and you will be handling this for them.  Their company manufactures a unique device which can turn over a bed-ridden hospital patient safely using an electro-mechanical device.  It avoids heavy lifting by nurses and has huge market potential.   A representative from a British company contacts your firm to request a consultation about applying for a start-up visa for a hospital device to turn over patients. In this situation, your firm should:
        - [ ] cease representing the German company.
        - [ ] book the consultation to get more details on the nature of the British product.
        - [ ] obtain written consent from the German company.
        - [x] not meet with the British company.
        > It will create an **ongoing conflict** to advise or represent business competitors with a related product, even with consent – the duties of loyalty and ability to maintain confidential information are compromised, or conceivably will be, which creates a substantive risk under s 1(2)(b). Also see **s 15(2)**.

    10. Your immigration consulting firm specializes in labour immigration, bringing large numbers of temporary foreign workers to Canada. In this capacity, it represents both employers and foreign workers. During an in-house training session with the firm's senior consultant Lisa Nguyen, Lisa explains that an immigration consultant is not allowed to:
        - [x] charge the workers for recruitment services.
        - [ ] charge the workers for immigration or recruiting services.
        - [ ] charge the employer for recruitment services.
        - [ ] charge the employer for both immigration and recruiting services.
        > See s **17(3)(c)** of the Code.
