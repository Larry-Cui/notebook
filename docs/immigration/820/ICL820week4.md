# Week 4: Conflicts of Interest

## Notes

??? note "Tutorial notes"

      - Case 1: Discussion Questions
          - Groups 1 & 2: Assuming that Jacques may be unable to come to Canada due to his inadmissibility, consider the impacts on (1) the company and (2) Carly. In light of these, what office procedures might Carly adopt to reduce the possibility of being in this situation in the future?
          - Groups 3 & 4: Using the definition of “conflict of interest” in section 1(2) of the Code, would you say that Carly’s situation, at the point where she pulls out the Code, amounts to an actual conflict of interest or a potential conflict of interest?  Explain. What is her immediate next step and why? Your answer should include who her clients are, and what role confidentiality plays in this scenario.
          - Groups 5 & 6: Sections 5, 6, 15(1), and 28(3) of the Code all bear on this scenario. Carly’s plan will necessarily depend on whether Jacques is willing to disclose this offence to the company. Either way (if Jacques will not disclose; if Jacques will disclose) can you devise a plan in each case for Carly that would fulfill her duties to both parties?  Be specific.

??? note "Conflicts of Interest"

      - A conflict of interest is a situation in which **your duty of loyalty to the client** or the representation of the client can be **adversely affected by**:
          -  your own interests, or
          -  your duties to another client (a current, former or joint client) or
          -  the interests of a third party such as a family member of your client
      - Even a **perceived conflict** is sufficient to impede the relationship and violate your duties under the Code of Professional Conduct.

          - According to IRCC’s guidelines for submitting a Family Class sponsorship application, an application is considered to be “made” at the time IRCC receives the complete application. The age of the dependent child is therefore **“locked-in” when IRCC receives an application**. (para 32)
          - However, where the incompetence or negligence of the applicant’s representative is sufficiently specific and clearly supported by the evidence **such negligence or incompetence is inherently prejudicial to the applicant and will warrant overturning the decision**, notwithstanding the lack of bad faith or absence of a failure to do anything on the part of the tribunal. (para 39)
          - The Applicant contends that by continuing to act for the Applicant in the appeal before the IAD, the Consultant placed himself in a **conflict of interest** with the Applicant. The Applicant argues that the **Consultant’s self-interest** was to not admit any error on his part and continue to make un-meritorious arguments, while the **Applicant’s interest** was to explain that she suffered a miscarriage of justice due to the Consultant’s error. (para 45)
          - See [paragraph 53](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2021/2021fc1360/2021fc1360.html#53){:target="\_blank"} of the decision explaining the rationale for the duty to recommend the client seek legal advice once you realize you have made an error prejudicing their case – this obligation is required by section 30(1)(b) of the Code of Professional Conduct for the very reasons that arose in this case.

      - **JOINT RETAINER AGREEMENTS:** The relevant provisions affecting joint clients can be found in sections 6.1 through 6.4 of the Retainer Agreement Regulation as follows:
          - 6.1 Before agreeing to represent more than one Client in a matter, a Licensee shall advise the Clients that: (a) Clients being simultaneously represented by a Licensee on a common matter should agree that the Licensee may **share information** among all Clients as required; and (b) if a **conflict** between Clients develops and cannot be resolved, the Licensee cannot continue to represent all Clients, and may have to **withdraw as the Client’s representative for one or all Clients**.
          - 6.2 If a Licensee has a continuing relationship with one Client for whom they act regularly before agreeing to act for that Client and another Client in a matter, the Licensee shall advise the other Client of the **continuing relationship**.
          - 6.3 Although all parties concerned may consent, a Licensee shall avoid acting for more than one Client if it is likely that **an issue contentious** between them will arise or their interests, rights, or obligations will diverge as the matter progresses.
          - 6.4 Where there is more than one Client, **both Clients must date and sign** the Joint Retainer Agreement
      - *Code*:
          - **Section 1(2)(a)** – Defines the conflict of interest where your own private interests or a third party’s interests (such as your spouse, friend or business partner) conflict with your client’s interests
          - **Section 1(2)(b)** – Defines the conflict of interest where the interests of another client or former client conflict with the interests of an existing client
          - **Section 5** – The duty of loyalty includes the duty to avoid conflicts of interest [as defined in s 1(2)]
          - **Section 15(1)** – Main rule regarding conflicts of interest: Not provide services in cases of actual or potential conflicts ("would or could result in a conflict of interest") unless....
          - **Section 15(1)** – An exception is where written disclosure of the details of the conflict or potential conflict is made to all parties and they give free and informed consent in writing for you to act for them
          - **Section 15(1)** – “Subject to sections 16 to 18” means that the rules in sections 16, 17 or 18 will take precedence where they apply; in other words, the disclosure and written consent referred to in section 15(1) will not suffice in the situations described in sections 16, 17 or 18, as more rules apply
          - **Section 15(2)(a)** – Disclosure and written consent will also not suffice where a reasonable person would think you could not be objective regarding your client’s interest, or develop the necessary trust with the client
          - **Section 15(2)(b)** – Disclosure and written consent will not suffice where a reasonable person would think you would necessarily have to compromise the confidentiality of any client or former client
          - Section 16 – Unauthorized behaviours – the situations in 16(1)(a), (b) and (c) are deemed to be conflicts of interest, and cannot be consented to by the client with the one exception set out in 16(2)
          - **Section 16(1)(a)** – No borrowing money from, or lending money to a client, directly or indirectly
          - **Section 16(1)(b)** – No additional services or arrangements outside of immigration services may be offered directly or indirectly to clients (such as employment, real estate sales or insurance services) except as per 16(2)
          - **Section 16(1)(c)** – No intimate relationships with the client for one year after services have ended, unless the services are for your spouse or common-law partner (‘conjugal relationship for at least one year’)
          - **Section 16(2)** – Additional transactions outside of immigration services are permitted, despite16(1)(b), if three conditions are met: the client consents; the terms are fair and reasonable; and the client confirms in writing they obtained independent advice about the transaction
          - **Section 17(1)** – Employment recruitment services defined in a unique way for Code purposes
          - **Section 17(2)** and (3) – Conditions applicable where the RCIC is advising or representing both the employer and the foreign worker
          - **Section 18(1)** – Student recruitment defined in a unique way for Code purposes
          - **Section 18(2) and (3)** – Conditions applicable when the RCIC is advising or representing both the education institution and the foreign student
          - **Section 24(3)(o)** - The service agreement must identify any actual or potential conflict of interest and describe the manner of dealing with it, for example, any special terms applicable to joint clients
          - **Section 35(1)(c)** – Termination of the service agreement is mandatory in the event a conflict of interest arises, unless consent under section 15 is applicable and is obtained.
