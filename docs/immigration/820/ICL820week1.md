# Week 1: Introduction to Ethical Practice

## Notes

??? note "tutorial notes"

    - case study: from most important to least important issues. use headings. don't copy codes or facts, use your own language.
    - the goal of CICC code: to protect the public.
    - key features of the code: 44 sections, 9 parts. Positive requirements (Competency, honesty, candor, trustworthiness, confidentiality, acting in client’s best interests, etc) and negative requirements (fraud, illegality, conflicts of interest, coercion, intimidation, assisting clients to misrepresent facts , helping fraudsters).
    - Licensees of the College: RCIC and RISIA
    - services includes pro bono services.
    - charging fees: not written in stone, as long as it's "reasonable".
    - RCIC is responsible for everything his/her staff does.
    - Quality Services: s 22(1)
    - best practices: have client review anything before submitted. always send copy to client. forward any correspondence from government to client immediately.
    - confidentiality goes on forever.
    - joint retainer: no confidentiality issue between joint clients.
    - Cast Study 1:
        - Group 1: Using the Code, identify the two most significant ethical violations potentially resulting in refusal of the application that Manuel has committed up to the point where he returned to work. Explain precisely when, and how, his actions or omissions breached each of the two provisions you identify.
            - s 22(1)(a) Meet applicable deadlines: Manuel is responsible
            - s 22(2) submission of necessary information to IRCC: Manuel and Jim are both responsible
        - Group 2: Considering the definition of a “client” in s 1(1) of the Code, is Serwaah a client of Jim’s? Explain why or why not with reference to this definition. Is the fact of Jim doing this for free relevant to whether Serwaah is a client? What about the fact there is no service agreement with Jim?
            - s 1(1)(b) definition of client. yes
            - no s 1(1)(c)
            - pro bono doesn't matter. Jim is at fault.
        - Group 3: It would be possible for Manuel to request an extension of time from IRCC to submit the Procedural Fairness response; that request would likely be granted. In terms of “efficient and cost-effective” services required under s. 22(1)(b), would this be a good option? why or why not? Keep in mind that Manuel is not fully incapacitated (the College has a system for that, which does not apply here).
            - not cost-effective or time-effective.
            - there is a risk of extension not being granted: plan b must be organized.
        - Group 4: Besides the main ethical violations as per Question 1, Manuel has failed to meet at least three other important duties to his client Serwaah. Identify at least three additional provisions of the Code applicable, and what Manuel could have done to avoid breaching them. You can identify more if you see them.
            - s 28: confidentiality
            - s 22(1)(c): communicate
        - Group 5: Assuming that Jim is willing to help Manuel, what sections of the Code would guide them to properly share the work in these circumstances? Use these provisions to explain what Manuel and Jim should do. Keep in mind we do not have access to Manuel’s service agreement, so we do not know what it says.
            - s 24(2)(c)(ii): possible? yes. practical? no. not efficient.
            - terminate Manuel and retain Jim? possible but not efficient.
            - proper way: Jim draft the submission, Manual reviews and sends it.
        - Group 6: Manuel now knows the material submitted by Jim was not sufficient to protect Serwaah’s interests, and her file may be rejected as a result. Once he discovers this error – what are Manuel’s duties under the Code?
            - s 30 applies
    - Case study 2:
        - Group 1: Identify who is Fathima’s client(s) here, with reference to the definition of client.
            - s 1(1)(a): both spouses are clients.
        - Group 2: Explain how section 28 (Confidentiality) applies to Fathima’s relationship with Juanita and Daniel.
        - Group 3: Identify at least three provisions of the Code which may have been breached by Fathima before the case was filed; explain at what point in time she breached each provision you identify, and how her actions or omissions constitute a breach.
            - s 5, 6 and 8
            - s 15
            - s 22(1)(c)
            - s 15/35(1)(c): conflict of interest
        - Group 4: Was there any ethical problem with Fathima filing the application when she did? Why or why not?
            - not an issue with filling the application.
            - relationship change after filling doesn't matter.
        - Group 5: Describe Fathima’s situation from the perspective of terminating the service agreement in these circumstances given Sections 35 and 36 of the Code. Your explanation should clearly indicate you understand how this would apply to Fathima and any steps she must or should take.
            - s 35(1)(a)
            - s 36(1), 35(2)
        - Group 6: Should Fathima assist Juanita with an H&C application? Why or why not?
            - not for Fathima to do this.

??? note "Citing Regulations"

    - A new code of conduct, the [*Code of Professional Conduct for College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants Licensees*, SOR/2022-128](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2022-128/){:target="\_blank"}, has now been established by federal regulation for licensees of the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants. It was pronounced to be in force **effective June 10, 2022**. The parent act for establishing this regulation is the [*College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants Act*](https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-33.6/FullText.html){:target="\_blank"}, SC 2019, c 29, s 292 [*College Act*], and specifically the authority given to the Minister in s 43 of that act to establish the initial code of conduct for the new College members, including RCICs and RISIAs.
    - When the Minister published the Code on June 22, 2022, a background document was also published with it, called the [Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement (RIAS)](https://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2022/2022-06-22/html/sor-dors128-eng.html){:target="\_blank"}.
    - The [*Interpretation Guide*](https://onq.queensu.ca/content/enforced/938607-ICL820F24/M1/PC_Code%20Guide-EN.pdf?isCourseFile=true&ou=938607){:target="\_blank"} is intended to provide clarification and guidance, with reference to current best practices, for Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultants (RCICs) and Regulated International Student Immigration Advisors (RISIAs) (collectively licensees), on the Code of Professional Conduct for Licensees of the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants. The Guide should be read in conjunction with the Code. However, it must be noted that the Guide itself is not a substitute for the Code. **All work and submissions made to support an argument in your written assignments must refer to the Code rather than the Interpretation Guide.**
    - In 2023, a new [summary of professional standards for College licensees](https://college-ic.ca/protecting-the-public/professional-standards-of-practice?l=en-CA){:target="\_blank"}, drafted in conjunction with licensees themselves, was adopted by the College Board.
    - Many guidelines such as rules of court or standards of professional conduct are structured as regulations made pursuant to the act under which they are promulgated.
    - It is acceptable in formal written work to shorten this to “**the Code**” or just “**Code**”, or **another term of your choosing**, as long as you use the full title the first time you use it and put the short form you choose in square brackets after it. Example:
        - ***Code of Professional Conduct for College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants Licensees***, SOR/2022-128 [***Code***].
    - In addition to referring to the Code itself, you will need to refer to specific section numbers in your written assignments. For example, in a written assignment, you wish to refer to the requirement to know when and how to apply for an adjournment at a hearing. To refer to this element of competency (knowing when and how to apply for an adjournment), you would write “**section 19(2)(b)(iii)**”. The abbreviation would be “**s 19(2)(b)(iii)**”.
    - In Case Study 2 in this Module, the consultant is representing a husband and wife on a spousal sponsorship file. This is generally referred to as a **joint retainer** and **both clients must sign the Service Agreement**. In joint retainers, special rules apply because the consultant has a duty of loyalty to advance the interests of both parties equally and can only do so as long as they are **sharing all relevant information and their interests (and instructions to the consultant) are aligned** throughout the process.
    - Law Society of Ontario, "[Steps for Dealing with the Paralegal Joint Retainer Rules](https://lso.ca/paralegals/practice-supports-and-resources/topics/the-paralegal-client-relationship/joint-retainers/steps-for-dealing-with-the-paralegal-joint-ret-(1)){:target="\_blank"}" (last visited 7 December 2022): Law Society of Ontario.
    - you should not accept a joint retainer if:
        - it is likely that a contentious issue between the parties will arise or their interests, rights or obligations will diverge as the matter progresses; or
        - the interests of the parties are not sufficiently similar to allow you to act in the best interests of all of the parties to the joint retainer.
    - Where the clients have consented to a joint retainer and a contentious issue between them or some of them arises, **refrain from advising** any of them on the contentious issue unless the clients have previously agreed that you may **continue to advise one of them** about the contentious matter.
    - **Complaints Committee** of **CICC** either determines the penalty or may refer the matter to the Discipline Committee if the evidence shows very serious violations (e.g. involving fraud or exploiting vulnerable clients) for large fines, suspension or revocation of licence.
    - The **Discipline Committee** is an independent tribunal which conducts hearings in keeping with rules of procedural fairness; the **College** is represented by counsel and the **RCIC** may retain counsel if they wish. Decisions of the Discipline Committee are subject to **Judicial Review** in the Federal Court.
    - During the course, you will do **two** entries in your **Reflective Practice Journal**. The first is due at the end of **Module 2**. The second is due at the end of **Module 5**. Each of your two journal entries must be 300 to 400 words. Please put your word count at the bottom of your document.

## Quizzes

??? note "Module 1: Knowledge Check"

    1. Codes of conduct in the legal sector generally will cover such things as:
        - [x] Professional misconduct, competence and advance payment rules
        - [ ] Quality of service, civility and minimum technology requirements
        - [ ] Confidentiality, withdrawing from representation and annual Continuing Professional Development (CPD) requirements
        - [ ] Conflicts of interest, errors and omissions and maximum fees

    2. The current Code of Professional Conduct for College licensees was made by whom, and under what authority?
        - [ ] Minister of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship, under section 91 of IRPA regarding who may provide immigration advice for a fee
        - [ ] Board of Directors of the College, under the authority of the College Act
        - [x] The Minister responsible, as a federal Regulation authorized under the College Act
        - [ ] IRCC (Immigration, Refugees, Citizenship Canada)

    3. Over the years, since regulation of immigration consultants began in 2004, several ethics codes have been in place from time to time.  However, only one Code is in effect now.  This is the one which we study in the GDipICL Program and refer to as “the Code”.  It is the:
        - [ ] RCIC Code of Professional Ethics
        - [ ] ICCRC Code of Conduct for Immigration Consultants
        - [ ] CICC Code of Professional Conduct for Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultants
        - [x] Code of Professional Conduct for College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants Licensees

    4. Statutory interpretation principles apply when interpreting the Code, as the Code is a federal regulation.  Which of the following explains a key principle of statutory interpretation and gives a correct example:
        - [ ] In the definition of a "client" in section 1(1), the word "or" separates clauses (b) and (c), meaning that a person who meets any one of the three conditions would be considered a client.
        - [ ] Given the definition of a "client" in section 1(1), a person who does not fit within any of the three clauses is not considered a client.
        - [ ] Section 22(1) of the Code lists a variety of elements from (a) to (f) that constitute "quality services" which must be delivered to clients.  Because the word "and" connects clauses (e) and (f), this means that all items on the list must be complied with
        - [x] All of the above.

    5. Ihab is an Iranian citizen currently studying engineering at the University of British Columbia.  He has been trying to get the necessary police certificate to prepare for his Express Entry application for over a year now.  He has encountered one obstacle after another with Iranian authorities.  Your client Ghada – also from Iran – had similar problems but finally figured out a way to do it.  You would like to put Ihab in touch with Ghada to discuss it. Under the principles of client confidentiality, it is correct to say that:
        - [ ] Seeking Ghada's consent to help another client is never appropriate
        - [ ] You know Ghada would not object and would likely be happy to help, making this a case of implied consent to pass on her contact information
        - [ ] This is not possible, as conveying contact information of a client is a breach of confidentiality
        - [x] This would not be a breach of confidentiality if Ghada consents to her contact information being shared for this purpose
        <br><i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i> What is otherwise a breach of confidentiality can be overcome by simply seeking the client's (or former client's) consent.  This is contemplated in **s 28(2)(a)**.

    6. When referring to formal legal materials such as a statute, regulation or judicial decision, there are standard protocols (called “citation”) for how to reference it correctly in a formal written document to ensure that legal readers can locate the source material if they wish. Although there are different legal citation systems used in the Canadian legal sector, the GDipICL program uses the McGill Guide for formal written assignments (not necessary for informal uses like the Discussion Board).   According to the McGill Guide summarized in “Citing Regulations” in Module 1, which sentence below has fully correct citation when referencing our Code:
        - [ ] According to Section 3, the Code applies to RCICs whether they charge fees or not.
        - [ ] Section 22 (1)(a) requires an RCIC to meet deadlines.
        - [ ] Section 22 (3) (a) would require an RCIC to notify clients of any correspondence they receive from IRCC on their file.
        - [x] According to section 1(1)(b) of the Code, a person can be a client despite even without a written agreement with the RCIC.
        <br><i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i> This has the proper spacing in the provision (no spaces), the use of the lower case "s" for "section" and italics for the word "Code".

    7. The field of immigration consulting first became a regulated profession in 2004, when the federal government created the first regulatory body, CSIC.  This followed a key decision of the Supreme Court of Canada in 2001 called the ***Mangat*** case. The reason the ***Mangat*** case was so important was because:
        - [ ] the Court granted approval for CSIC (Canadian Society of Immigration Consultants) to be established
        - [x] the Court determined that the federal government's jurisdiction to regulate immigration consultants was paramount over the provincial jurisdiction to regulate professions
        - [ ] the provincial law societies were given permission to regulate immigration consultants
        - [ ] the Supreme Court created the CICC (College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants).

    8. Hyungee is excited to be starting up her immigration consulting business.  She will focus on student recruitment from Korea.  She cannot believe her good fortune when a famous fashion model in Korea, Kim Hee Jeong, contacts her to ask about a study permit.  During the initial consultation, Hyungee determines that Kim is a great candidate to start a fashion design course at Vancouver College.  They enter into a service agreement to commence the study permit application. The next week at a conference of education agents, Hyungee runs into other Korean RCICs. "You will not believe who I am representing", she exclaimed – the famous Kim Hee Jeong!" You overheard this and correctly determine that:
        - [x] This is a breach of confidentiality
        - [ ] This is not a breach of confidentiality as everyone else at the conference are also professionals and will treat it as confidential
        - [ ] This is not a breach of confidentiality because no information was disclosed about Kim's application
        - [ ] This is not a breach of confidentiality because Kim is already famous and in the public eye

    9. You have an immigration practice in Prince George in which you largely serve the Philippine community.  Your friend from the community association, Flora Negano, is very active in the community, always trying to help immigrants from the Philippines and their relatives wanting to come here. At a Christmas party, your assistant told her Flora's own cousin Imee Negano had inquired about possible immigration. Flora is thrilled and calls you the next day to see if it is true and how she can help. The ethical issues are:
        - [ ] None, as you yourself did not breach confidentiality
        - [ ] A breach of confidentiality by staff
        - [x] A breach of confidentiality and likely failure to train staff properly.
        - [ ] None, because Imee is not yet a client
        <br><i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i> **Confidentiality is owed to potential clients** as well who approach you for possible services.

    10. In general, it is considered a breach of confidentiality to discuss your client's identity or any other identifying details about their immigration case with:
        - [x] your spouse
        - [ ] another RCIC at your immigration firm
        - [ ] your paralegal at the office
        - [ ] an immigration officer
        <br><i class="fa-solid fa-triangle-exclamation"></i> The client has not authorized you to discuss the matter with your family, so that is **a breach of s 28(1) – no exceptions under 28(2) apply**.
