# Week 6: Interpreters and Working in a Digital World

## Notes

??? note "Tutorial notes"

    - **Case 1: Refugee Claim**
        - Group 1: Identify as many errors as you can regarding the way in which the interpreter Fredrico has carried out his duties - just identify his errors, not the correct approach (that is Group 2).
        - Group 2: Identify what Fredrico should have done as a professional interpreter, according to the CISOC "Guide to Working with Interpreters".
        - Group 3: Identify as many errors as you can made by the consultant Samantha -- just identify her errors, not the correct approach (that is Group 4).
        - Group 4: Identify what actions Samantha should have taken to handle this interpretation process correctly.
        - Group 5: Hiring an interpreter is a judgment call for an RCIC to make, as s 22(1)(e) only requires this be done “when necessary”. Based on what you know about immigration and refugee cases so far, post a factual situation where you believe it would be necessary to use a professional interpreter. Try to identify the factors that you think are important in making this decision in the case you raise, and generally what factors are important in deciding when to hire a professional to interpret rather than using family or friends.
        - Group 6: Given the “Six Rules” of the Code of Conduct for IRB Interpreter Service Contractors in the Required Readings, pick one of the rules that apply at the IRB that would also be expected of Fredrico as a professional interpreter in this scenario, and explain how his conduct violated the spirit of that rule.

???+ note "onQ module"

    - It may be appropriate to have a direct conversation with a client with help from **a relative or friend** interpreting for them when **setting appointments or obtaining general information** but not for the purposes of preparing **an affidavit** for them. 
    - the appropriate and effective use of **technology** is one of the requirements of being competent found in section **19(2)(e)** of the Code of Professional Conduct.
    - ***Code* using interpreters:**
        - Section 22(1)(e) – retain interpreter/translator services when necessary
        - Section 22(4) – dealing with interpreters and translators
        - Section 24(3)(e) – disclosure of names of anyone assisting in the service agreement
    - ***Code* using appropriate technology:**
        - 22(1)(b) – conduct the client’s affairs in an efficient and cost-effective manner
        - 19(2)(e) – deliver services using appropriate and effective technology
        - 43 – public statements
        - 44 – marketing
        - 45 – client endorsements
        - 46 – logos
    - The Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) provides **interpreters free of charge** in the language and dialect needed for a fair hearing before its tribunals. The applicant must request this on their forms. Because refugee hearings can involve life or death decisions for claimants, the standards and protocols for interpretation at the IRB are extremely rigorous.
    - *He v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2022 FC 112](https://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/fc-cf/decisions/en/item/520620/index.do){:target="\_blank"}.
        - In this case, the translation was done by the spouse’s company lawyer who acknowledged he had made **a mistake in translating** a key question on the work permit application form that resulted in the applicant providing inaccurate information. Given the inaccurate information, the officer found the spouse **inadmissible for misrepresentation** and refused the work permit.
    - *Memari v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2010 FC 1196 (CanLII)](https://canlii.ca/t/2dq0v){:target="\_blank"}.
        - [59] The applicant appears to have been consistent from the outset with respect to the dates, according to the Persian calendar, of his detentions and his escape from Iran. However, he was unable to read the English translation of those dates into the Gregorian calendar, or to verify the accuracy of the translated dates as they were interpreted to him at the port of entry and in his counsel’s office. He therefore had to rely on Ms. Leggett in that regard. He was clearly **prejudiced by her failure** to adequately represent him in relation to those critical aspects of his claims.
    - The IRB provided all the affected parties the opportunity to have their **cases re-opened** if they so wished.
        - Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, "IRB Acts to Address Misconduct by an Interpreter" (last modified 27 January 2023), [online](https://irb.gc.ca/en/news/2023/Pages/interpreter-misconduct.aspx#:~:text=%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B,without%20authorization%20by%20the%20IRB%20){:target="\_blank"}.
    - IRCC is embracing the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a major way in its decision-making processes for temporary and permanent residence applications.  The platform currently in use is called "**Chinook**", which allows for **targeting, compiling and presenting data to officers from across multiple client applications** – for example, it is possible to see all applications from a certain country or region, or a demographic factor such as ethnic group, age or religion - any characteristic of interest to the officer with the aim of making decisions more efficiently.
    - **Pulling certain groups of applications** also allows IRCC to identify patterns not otherwise visible, for example concerning the work of a certain representative, or evidence that a ‘ghost consultant’ may be involved in the files.
    - Cases at the Federal Court have begun to **challenge Chinook**, but as yet no applicants have been able to show that an officer’s discretion was fettered by use of this tool in a way that undermined procedural fairness.
    - *Khosravi v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2023 FC 805 (CanLII)](https://canlii.ca/t/jxn8b){:target="\_blank"}
        - [12] I note that Ms. Khosravi’s application was “processed with the assistance of Chinook 3+”. I do not know if the shortcomings outlined above result from the use of this tool. I will simply say that the use of assisted decision-making tools does not relieve officers from the duty to fully consider an application, most importantly the study plan. **If the use of such a tool gives the officer a truncated vision of the application, the resulting decision may well be unreasonable.**
    - *Raja v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2023 FC 719 (CanLII)](https://canlii.ca/t/jxfdq){:target="\_blank"}
        - [30] I agree with the Respondent. While it was open to the Applicant to raise the ways that the Chinook processing tool specifically resulted in a breach of procedural fairness in the Officer’s assessment of his case, he has not provided any evidence of such a connection. I would also note that the **Chinook tool is not** intended to process, assess evidence, or make decisions on applications, and the Applicant has failed to raise any evidence countering this or demonstrating that the tool **impacts the fairness of the decision-making process**.
    - Section 99(1)(a) of the *Customs Act*, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (2nd Supp.) currently allows border officers to examine any “goods” carried by the traveler. CBSA has maintained this section gives officers authority to search electronic files contained on personal digital devices, and has developed policy to guide officers in applying it.
        - 99 (1) An officer may<br>(a) at any time up to the time of release, examine any goods that have been imported and open or cause to be opened any package or container of imported goods and take samples of imported goods in reasonable amounts;
    - However, two recent court cases, *Pike* in Ontario and *Canfield* in Alberta [see links in Optional Readings] have found this section of the Customs Act to be **unconstitutional** for violating section 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, namely the right to be secure against unreasonable searches.
    - Bill S-7, An Act to amend the Customs Act and the Pre-clearance Act, 2016, it set out the government’s proposed reform of border searches of digital devices. The test now being proposed in S-7 is that the officer needs "**reasonable grounds to suspect**" the device might show conduct unlawful under federal law (such as the *Criminal Code*, *Customs Act* or *IRPA*).
