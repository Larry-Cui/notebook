# Week 6: Interpreters and Working in a Digital World

## Notes

??? note "Tutorial notes"

    - s 22(1)(e): must hire interpreters and translators when necessary
    - s 22(4): instruct accuracy
    - **Case 1: Refugee Claim**
        - Group 1: Identify as many errors as you can regarding the way in which the interpreter Fredrico has carried out his duties - just identify his errors, not the correct approach (that is Group 2).
        - Group 2: Identify what Fredrico should have done as a professional interpreter, according to the CISOC "Guide to Working with Interpreters".
        - Group 3: Identify as many errors as you can made by the consultant Samantha -- just identify her errors, not the correct approach (that is Group 4).
        - Group 4: Identify what actions Samantha should have taken to handle this interpretation process correctly.
        - Group 5: Hiring an interpreter is a judgment call for an RCIC to make, as s 22(1)(e) only requires this be done “when necessary”. Based on what you know about immigration and refugee cases so far, post a factual situation where you believe it would be necessary to use a professional interpreter. Try to identify the factors that you think are important in making this decision in the case you raise, and generally what factors are important in deciding when to hire a professional to interpret rather than using family or friends.
        - Group 6: Given the “Six Rules” of the Code of Conduct for IRB Interpreter Service Contractors in the Required Readings, pick one of the rules that apply at the IRB that would also be expected of Fredrico as a professional interpreter in this scenario, and explain how his conduct violated the spirit of that rule.
    - **Case Study 2: Medical Inadmissibility**
        - Group 1: This consultation will be on Zoom. Discuss the applicability of the Code to virtual meetings – are there any differences in RCIC obligations when client meetings are virtual? What do you think is the most applicable section of the Code?
        Group 2: Based on the matters raised in the section titled “Virtual Meetings, Hearings and Interviews” at page 39 of the CBA article “Legal Ethics in a Digital Context”, identify at least two technical matters the RCIC should consider when setting up this virtual meeting.
        - Group 3: Under the “Professional Conduct” sections of the Code (sections 4-18), do you believe that Juan’s plan violates any of these provisions?  Explain.
        - Groups 4: Under the “Competence” sections of the Code (sections 19-22), do you believe that Juan’s plan violates any of these provisions? Explain.
        - Group 5: Under sections 23-28 of the “Relationship to Clients” provisions of the Code, do you believe that Juan is in breach of any of these provisions? Explain.
        - Group 6: Assume this Zoom meeting went ahead as planned. After a few minutes, Maria realized that Juan knew very little about medical inadmissibility and could not answer any of her questions about what was likely to happen in her case. She pointedly asked him whether he had ever dealt with a cancer case before. What do you think Juan should do?

??? note "onQ module"

    - It may be appropriate to have a direct conversation with a client with help from **a relative or friend** interpreting for them when **setting appointments or obtaining general information** but not for the purposes of preparing **an affidavit** for them. 
    - the appropriate and effective use of **technology** is one of the requirements of being competent found in section **19(2)(e)** of the Code of Professional Conduct.
    - ***Code* using interpreters:**
        - Section 22(1)(e) – retain interpreter/translator services when necessary
        - Section 22(4) – dealing with interpreters and translators
        - Section 24(3)(e) – disclosure of names of anyone assisting in the service agreement
    - ***Code* using appropriate technology:**
        - 22(1)(b) – conduct the client’s affairs in an efficient and cost-effective manner
        - 19(2)(e) – deliver services using appropriate and effective technology
        - 43 – public statements
        - 44 – marketing
        - 45 – client endorsements
        - 46 – logos
    - The Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB) provides **interpreters free of charge** in the language and dialect needed for a fair hearing before its tribunals. The applicant must request this on their forms. Because refugee hearings can involve life or death decisions for claimants, the standards and protocols for interpretation at the IRB are extremely rigorous.
    - *He v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2022 FC 112](https://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/fc-cf/decisions/en/item/520620/index.do){:target="\_blank"}.
        - In this case, the translation was done by the spouse’s company lawyer who acknowledged he had made **a mistake in translating** a key question on the work permit application form that resulted in the applicant providing inaccurate information. Given the inaccurate information, the officer found the spouse **inadmissible for misrepresentation** and refused the work permit.
    - *Memari v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2010 FC 1196 (CanLII)](https://canlii.ca/t/2dq0v){:target="\_blank"}.
        - [59] The applicant appears to have been consistent from the outset with respect to the dates, according to the Persian calendar, of his detentions and his escape from Iran. However, he was unable to read the English translation of those dates into the Gregorian calendar, or to verify the accuracy of the translated dates as they were interpreted to him at the port of entry and in his counsel’s office. He therefore had to rely on Ms. Leggett in that regard. He was clearly **prejudiced by her failure** to adequately represent him in relation to those critical aspects of his claims.
    - The IRB provided all the affected parties the opportunity to have their **cases re-opened** if they so wished.
        - Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, "IRB Acts to Address Misconduct by an Interpreter" (last modified 27 January 2023), [online](https://irb.gc.ca/en/news/2023/Pages/interpreter-misconduct.aspx#:~:text=%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B,without%20authorization%20by%20the%20IRB%20){:target="\_blank"}.
    - IRCC is embracing the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in a major way in its decision-making processes for temporary and permanent residence applications.  The platform currently in use is called "**Chinook**", which allows for **targeting, compiling and presenting data to officers from across multiple client applications** – for example, it is possible to see all applications from a certain country or region, or a demographic factor such as ethnic group, age or religion - any characteristic of interest to the officer with the aim of making decisions more efficiently.
    - **Pulling certain groups of applications** also allows IRCC to identify patterns not otherwise visible, for example concerning the work of a certain representative, or evidence that a ‘ghost consultant’ may be involved in the files.
    - Cases at the Federal Court have begun to **challenge Chinook**, but as yet no applicants have been able to show that an officer’s discretion was fettered by use of this tool in a way that undermined procedural fairness.
    - *Khosravi v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2023 FC 805 (CanLII)](https://canlii.ca/t/jxn8b){:target="\_blank"}
        - [12] I note that Ms. Khosravi’s application was “processed with the assistance of Chinook 3+”. I do not know if the shortcomings outlined above result from the use of this tool. I will simply say that the use of assisted decision-making tools does not relieve officers from the duty to fully consider an application, most importantly the study plan. **If the use of such a tool gives the officer a truncated vision of the application, the resulting decision may well be unreasonable.**
    - *Raja v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2023 FC 719 (CanLII)](https://canlii.ca/t/jxfdq){:target="\_blank"}
        - [30] I agree with the Respondent. While it was open to the Applicant to raise the ways that the Chinook processing tool specifically resulted in a breach of procedural fairness in the Officer’s assessment of his case, he has not provided any evidence of such a connection. I would also note that the **Chinook tool is not** intended to process, assess evidence, or make decisions on applications, and the Applicant has failed to raise any evidence countering this or demonstrating that the tool **impacts the fairness of the decision-making process**.
    - Section 99(1)(a) of the *Customs Act*, R.S.C. 1985, c. 1 (2nd Supp.) currently allows border officers to examine any “goods” carried by the traveler. CBSA has maintained this section gives officers authority to search electronic files contained on personal digital devices, and has developed policy to guide officers in applying it.
        - 99 (1) An officer may<br>(a) at any time up to the time of release, examine any goods that have been imported and open or cause to be opened any package or container of imported goods and take samples of imported goods in reasonable amounts;
    - However, two recent court cases, *Pike* in Ontario and *Canfield* in Alberta [see links in Optional Readings] have found this section of the Customs Act to be **unconstitutional** for violating section 8 of the Canadian Charter of Rights and Freedoms, namely the right to be secure against unreasonable searches.
    - Bill S-7, An Act to amend the Customs Act and the Pre-clearance Act, 2016, it set out the government’s proposed reform of border searches of digital devices. The test now being proposed in S-7 is that the officer needs "**reasonable grounds to suspect**" the device might show conduct unlawful under federal law (such as the *Criminal Code*, *Customs Act* or *IRPA*).

## Quizzes

??? note "Module 6: Knowledge Check"

    1. Jenny, an immigration consultant in Halifax, is a bit nervous.  She is about to hire her first professional interpreter to assist her with a sponsorship appeal where the applicant speaks Swahili, a language she has no knowledge of.  She found the interpreter through a local immigrant services agency and has arranged for a Zoom conference with the parties this afternoon.  From her reading on the protocols for professional interpreters, Jenny can expect the interpreter to:
        - [ ] engage in small talk with the client before the formal start of the meeting so they can get to know each other.
        - [ ] remain after the meeting with her to clarify anything the client said that Jenny does not understand.
        - [x] raise a hand to interrupt if there appears to be a misunderstanding.
        - [ ] keep notes of the session for future reference.

    2. Tewedros was trying to submit a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) application on the new (and not very user-friendly) online system of Employment and Social Development Canada (ESDC). He completed the application and "signed" the Attestation as a third-party representative, as permitted. However, when he clicked submit, he was returned to the summary page. He tried it with both Chrome and Microsoft Edge. No luck. He is beyond frustrated as he is going on holiday for two weeks tomorrow and planned to get this uploaded before leaving. What ethical guidance, if any, does the Code provide?
        - [ ] None – it does not address computer glitches that are the fault of government websites.
        - [ ] He is **still responsible** to the client despite technical barriers.
        - [ ] He can be **candid with the client** about the glitch and his holiday plans, and **seek instructions to wait for two weeks**.
        - [x] Both B and C.

    3. The Code of Professional Conduct requires RCICs to use technology that is appropriate and to use technology effectively.  These obligations are specifically stated in the Code as part of the duty of:
        - [ ] delivering quality services.
        - [ ] proper record-keeping.
        - [ ] dilegence.
        - [x] competence.
        > **s 19(2)(e)**

    4. Michael, an immigration consultant in Waterloo, Ontario has hired a professional Punjabi interpreter to help him prepare for a detention hearing. After introductions and some ground rules, Michael starts by asking the client: Where were you born? The client speaks briefly. The interpreter tells Michael: He says he was born in Chandigarh. As a competent consultant Michael knows:
        - [ ] this interpretation sounds efficient and proper.
        - [ ] this is not the best way to interpret, but the meaning is clear and that is the main thing.
        - [x] this is not a proper way to interpret and he should stop the interpreter.
        - [ ] it is not proper interpretation, but is too minor to stop.

    5. As immigration practice increasingly moves towards digitalization, it is important for consultants to understand key security and privacy risks and adopt good cybersecurity hygiene. Good **cybersecurity** hygiene in a legal context includes such practices as:
        - [x] **Password protection**, **data encryption** and **up-to-date software**.
        - [ ] Firewalls, two-step identification and cloud storage.
        - [ ] Anti-virus software and banning digital signatures.
        - [ ] Device location tracking software with remote wipe capabilities and one back-up.

    6. Sarah conducts refugee cases before the Immigration and Refugee Board.  Her current client Yin Chin is a Chinese citizen who claims persecution based on being a proponent of Falun Gong¸ a practice which is banned in China. Sarah has no ability to communicate in Mandarin and Yin Chin has no ability to communicate in English. However, Yin Chin has a cousin who has offered to attend meetings and interpret for her. Yin Chin would prefer to do that than pay for a professional interpreter. Sarah’s best course of action is to:
        - [ ] accept the cousin's offer gratefully, to save the costs.
        - [ ] decline the offer as family is banned as interpreters by the College.
        - [x] advise the parties that **a professional interpreter will be needed**.
        - [ ] ask the cousin to obtain certification as a professional interpreter.

    7. Which of the following statements is currently correct as it pertains to the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in processing immigration applications?
        - [x] AI will **revolutionize** the delivery of immigration services.
        - [ ] AI will find limited to no use in the delivery of immigration services.
        - [ ] AI has improved the individualized assessment of applications.
        - [ ] AI is in charge of making decisions on various types of applications.

    8. Digital client data may be deleted once client information is no longer needed to comply with any College requirements for keeping client records. Deleting unneeded client data minimizes the negative impact if you are victim of a future security breach of your devices and files – as client information cannot be accessed. When deleting client digital data, the most practical and secure method is to:
        - [ ] Use the standard "delete" function on your device.
        - [ ] Physically destroy the device.
        - [x] Wipe or scrub the device with a proper tool for this purpose.
        - [ ] Transfer the client digital data to another secure device.

    9. Cloud-based storage of data by businesses is increasingly common. Cloud services have many benefits for practitioners in the legal sector, such as access to data from anywhere. However, there are some drawbacks as well, as cloud services require placing your data in the hands of third parties.  Some ethical matters to consider when using cloud storage include:
        - [ ] how to access your data and costs.
        - [x] protection of confidentiality and where the server is located.
        - [ ] who owns the encryption keys and competency.
        - [ ] access to local back-up and conflicts of interest.

    10. Professional interpreters are often members of an organization that promotes professional standards and ethics for interpreters.  **Standard elements** found in codes of ethics for **professional interpreters** include provisions on:
        - [ ] confidentiality, fees and conflict of interest.
        - [ ] accuracy, impartiality and dress code.
        - [ ] confidentiality, conflict of interest and qualifying exams.
        - [x] **accuracy**, **confidentiality** and **conflict of interest**.
