# Week 1: Introduction to Ethical Practice

???+ note "Citing Regulations"

    - A new code of conduct, the [Code of Professional Conduct for College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants Licensees, SOR/2022-128](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/SOR-2022-128/){:target="\_blank"}, has now been established by federal regulation for licensees of the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants. It was pronounced to be in force **effective June 10, 2022**. The parent act for establishing this regulation is the [*College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants Act*](https://laws.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/C-33.6/FullText.html){:target="\_blank"}, SC 2019, c 29, s 292 [*College Act*], and specifically the authority given to the Minister in s 43 of that act to establish the initial code of conduct for the new College members, including RCICs and RISIAs.
    - When the Minister published the Code on June 22, 2022, a background document was also published with it, called the [Regulatory Impact Analysis Statement (RIAS)](https://www.gazette.gc.ca/rp-pr/p2/2022/2022-06-22/html/sor-dors128-eng.html){:target="\_blank"}.
    - The [*Interpretation Guide*](https://onq.queensu.ca/content/enforced/938607-ICL820F24/M1/PC_Code%20Guide-EN.pdf?isCourseFile=true&ou=938607){:target="\_blank"} is intended to provide clarification and guidance, with reference to current best practices, for Regulated Canadian Immigration Consultants (RCICs) and Regulated International Student Immigration Advisors (RISIAs) (collectively licensees), on the Code of Professional Conduct for Licensees of the College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants. The Guide should be read in conjunction with the Code. However, it must be noted that the Guide itself is not a substitute for the Code. **All work and submissions made to support an argument in your written assignments must refer to the Code rather than the Interpretation Guide.**
    - In 2023, a new [summary of professional standards for College licensees](https://college-ic.ca/protecting-the-public/professional-standards-of-practice?l=en-CA){:target="\_blank"}, drafted in conjunction with licensees themselves, was adopted by the College Board.
    - Many guidelines such as rules of court or standards of professional conduct are structured as regulations made pursuant to the act under which they are promulgated.
    - It is acceptable in formal written work to shorten this to “**the Code**” or just “**Code**”, or **another term of your choosing**, as long as you use the full title the first time you use it and put the short form you choose in square brackets after it. Example:
        - ***Code of Professional Conduct for College of Immigration and Citizenship Consultants Licensees***, SOR/2022-128 [***Code***].
    - In addition to referring to the Code itself, you will need to refer to specific section numbers in your written assignments. For example, in a written assignment, you wish to refer to the requirement to know when and how to apply for an adjournment at a hearing. To refer to this element of competency (knowing when and how to apply for an adjournment), you would write “**section 19(2)(b)(iii)**”. The abbreviation would be “**s 19(2)(b)(iii)**”.
    - In Case Study 2 in this Module, the consultant is representing a husband and wife on a spousal sponsorship file. This is generally referred to as a **joint retainer** and **both clients must sign the Service Agreement**. In joint retainers, special rules apply because the consultant has a duty of loyalty to advance the interests of both parties equally and can only do so as long as they are **sharing all relevant information and their interests (and instructions to the consultant) are aligned** throughout the process.
    - Law Society of Ontario, "[Steps for Dealing with the Paralegal Joint Retainer Rules](https://lso.ca/paralegals/practice-supports-and-resources/topics/the-paralegal-client-relationship/joint-retainers/steps-for-dealing-with-the-paralegal-joint-ret-(1)){:target="\_blank"}" (last visited 7 December 2022): Law Society of Ontario.
    - you should not accept a joint retainer if:
        - it is likely that a contentious issue between the parties will arise or their interests, rights or obligations will diverge as the matter progresses; or
        - the interests of the parties are not sufficiently similar to allow you to act in the best interests of all of the parties to the joint retainer.
    - Where the clients have consented to a joint retainer and a contentious issue between them or some of them arises, **refrain from advising** any of them on the contentious issue unless the clients have previously agreed that you may **continue to advise one of them** about the contentious matter.
