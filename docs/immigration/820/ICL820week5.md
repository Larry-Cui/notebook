          - Group 6: Assuming Mitzi identifies as a member of the LGBTQ+ community and tells you this at your next meeting with her, can you see how a conflict of interest might arise with this new information between your own interests and your duty of loyalty to Mitzi's interests?

## Quizzes

??? note "Module 5: Knowledge Check"

    1. Ali Butros has operated his own refugee practice for many years. Several of his clients from war-torn countries have been traumatized by their experiences. Ali has been having great difficulty getting his client Ibrahim Kuol from South Sudan to open up about his experiences enough to make the strongest possible case for him.  It would be appropriate for Ali to accommodate his traumatized client by:
        -  [ ] requiring Ibrahim to see a counsellor.
        -  [ ] offering to terminate the service agreement.
        -  [x] arranging meetings on the weekends when the office is quiet, and no other clients are booked.
        -  [ ] contacting a mental health worker to attend for support.

    2. Self-care includes setting appropriate boundaries for your work with clients.  For instance, you may establish hours when you can be contacted, time frames for your response to emails, procedures when a client does not pay as agreed, etc.  A good indicator of whether you are setting proper boundaries with clients is:
        - [ ] the amount of time you spend on client files.
        - [x] the amount of **stress caused by client actions**.
        - [ ] the amount on revenue from clients.
        - [ ] the amount of preparation before undertaking a file.

    3. Immigration consultants are frequently called upon to demonstrate cultural sensitivity to clients from a wide variety of backgrounds.  The need to demonstrate culturally sensitive for an RCIC is:
        - [ ] important in serving diverse clients, but not strictly required by the Code.
        - [ ] part of the duty of competence in the Code.
        - [x] a mandatory aspect of delivering quality services to clients.
        - [ ] necessary to include in the service agreement.
        > This is an obligation stated in s 22(1)(d) of the *Code*.

    4. The acronym "EDI" generally stands for:
        - [ ] Empowerment, Determination and Inclusivity.
        - [x] **Equity, Diversity and Inclusion**.
        - [ ] Equality, Diversity and Inclusion.
        - [ ] None of the above.

    5. The Chairperson of the Immigration and Refugee Board has the authority to pass Guidelines for its four tribunals: the IAD, the ID, the RPD and the RAD. The authority to do so is provided in the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act, in s. 159(1)(h). [Several of these were initially issued under the previous Immigration Act, s. 65 but have been continued under IRPA].  The Guidelines provide principles for adjudicating and managing cases by Panel members and IRB staff for the benefit of certain disadvantaged groups bringing cases before the IRB.  These Guidelines:
        - [ ] have the force of law and are mandatory to be followed by IRB decision-makers.
        - [x] **are expected to be followed by IRB decision-makers unless there are valid reasons to depart**.
        - [ ] are handed down verbally.
        - [ ] must be issued and applied by IRB decision-makers for all EDI categories.

    6. A mother Johanna is watching television with her young daughter Sylvie.  One of the characters in the show Wanda is a big woman who is experiencing chest pains and is on her way to the hospital to get checked out.  Johanna voices her opinion that people like Wanda are obese because “they overeat and lack the willpower to control their weight and just need to go on a diet and get more exercise”.  Which of the following concepts is best illustrated by Johanna’s comments about Wanda?
        - [ ] micro-aggression.
        - [ ] unconscious bias.
        - [x] **stereotype**.
        - [ ] discrimination.
        > **If these comments were said to Wanda, or in her presence, it may be considered a micro-aggression** but there is another concept on the list that is a more specific fit.

    7. We all make assumptions about other people – it is human nature and is not necessarily a bad thing.  However, we should try to be conscious of our assumptions, because sometimes they can be wrong and even harmful if we act on them.   RCICs often work with people across cultures; we must be alert to our own biases and assumptions when providing services and building a relationship of trust with clients. The reason the “camera exercise” recommended in the training video for those conducting the IRCC Immigration Medical Exams in the Required Readings is so powerful is because:
        - [ ] almost everyone has a camera on their cell phone these days to take pictures as needed for evidence.
        - [x] it helps bring unconscious biases into your conscious awareness.
        - [ ] it identifies micro-aggressions.
        - [ ] none of the above.
        > Seeing through a camera lens allows you to see "what is there", objectively without judgment. It records just facts, without interpretation. Your other interpretations and conclusions about the person are your assumptions.

    8. There is an old riddle that goes like this:  A father and his son were in a car accident.  The father was killed and the son was taken to the hospital.  The doctor looked at the boy and said: “I can’t operate on that boy – he’s my son!”.  Who is the doctor? The answer to this riddle is the doctor is the boy’s mother. This riddle is effective (and stumps many people) because it illustrates:
        - [x] a common **stereotype about gender**.
        - [ ] an conscious bias.
        - [ ] a micro-aggression.
        - [ ] none of the above.

    9. The letters "SC" at the end of the acronym "SOGIESC" refer to 'sex characteristics'.  The letters "SOGIE" stand for:
        - [ ] sexual organization, gender identity or expression.
        - [ ] sexuality or gender identity and expression.
        - [x] sexual orientation, gender identity and expression.
        - [ ] None of the above.

    10. Trauma and violence-informed approaches refer to:
        - [ ] laws intended to benefit victims of crime.
        - [x] policies and practices that **recognize the connection** between trauma and behaviors.
        - [ ] the IRB Chairperson's Guidelines.
        - [ ] the policies and practices in place to treat trauma.
