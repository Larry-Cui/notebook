## Skills Reflection

### Step 1: Self-Assess

Prepare to track your development in this course by establishing a baseline for comparison. Review the [Competency Inventory](https://onq.queensu.ca/content/enforced/497280-GDipICLProgramPortal/Engagement/GDipICL%20Competency%20Inventory%20.docx?isCourseFile=true&ou=497280){:target="\_blank"} and the nine core Skills and Values in relation to the course learning outcomes for this course (OnQ Course page > Content > Start Here > Syllabus > Course Learning Outcomes).

### Step 2: Engage

Complete the Engagement activities you find in the Engagement Checklist at the beginning of each module. The activities are also marked with banners.

### Step 3: Reflect on Engagement

Throughout the course, review the list of core Skills and Values at the top of this page (and reproduced in your course syllabus). Track both your successes as well as challenges. Using the [Kolb model of Reflective Practice](https://onq.queensu.ca/d2l/common/dialogs/quickLink/quickLink.d2l?ou=497280&type=content&rcode=Queens-2642419){:target="\_blank"} as a guide, reflect on those successes and challenges using specific examples from your course experience: what did you do well? What did you do poorly? Where are there still gaps in your skill set? What can you do next time to improve your performance?

### Step 4: Create your Skills Reflection

In 400 words (plus or minus 50 words), write a reflective narrative in two parts:

**Part 1**

Describe the changes you observe in your skill set, considering where you started from at the beginning of the course.

- Where did you see the most change in the nine Skills and Values from your initial self-assessment? Address one or two of the skills on the list of nine that you feel you made the most progress in during this course. Remember, it is not about immigration knowledge you gained, but about your growth in those one or two skills through your participation in the Engagement activities.
- What specific Engagement activities led to or fostered that change?
- What was it about your experience with those elements that created growth? (Keep in mind that failures as well as successes contribute to growth and the development of competency.)

**Part 2**

Identify those skills areas where growth did not occur or where further growth is necessary. Outline a concrete plan to initiate or advance further growth in those areas.

- What competencies are still developing for you? What skills are they related to?
- What did you observe that made you aware of your areas of weakness?
- Where did you hope to see change, but it didn’t materialize?
- What could you do differently? What is your plan for effective future growth in those areas?

Think of questions 1 to 3 of Part 2 as necessary "pre-work" for question 4. You need to identify the skills you want to work on before you can plan how to address them. Question 4 is the ultimate focus of Part 2.

### Step 5: Build and submit a compendium of Skills Reflections

A [template](https://onq.queensu.ca/content/enforced/497280-GDipICLProgramPortal/Engagement/Skills_Reflections_Template.docx?isCourseFile=true&ou=497280){:target="\_blank"} has been created for your Skills Reflections, which includes a header for each course in the GDipICL. Please submit your Skills Reflections using the template. You can either write directly in the template or cut and paste your reflections into it.
