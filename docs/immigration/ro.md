## Residency Obligation ("RO") to keep your PR status

**If you have been a permanent resident for five (5) years or more:**

you must have been physically present in Canada for a minimum of `730` days within the past five (5) years.

**If you have been a permanent resident for less than five (5) years:**

you must show that you will be able to meet the minimum of `730` days of physical presence in Canada within five (5) years of the date you became a permanent resident.

!!! warning "Note"
    In both of above two situations, the `730` days **don't** have to be continuous.

## When does this obligation begin?

As soon as an immigrant obtains his/her PR status.

!!! warning "Note"
    PR Status begins before you receive your PR card

An immigrant receives his/her permanent resident status when he/she crosses the Canadian border with an **immigration visa**. After going through the necessary immigration procedures at a Port of Entry, which is the first airport or land crossing they stop at in Canada, the immigrant is granted full permanent residence rights.

A few days after, the immigrant gets sent their PR card by mail. This card serves as proof of their status and needs to be reissued every five years. 

## Relations between PR status and PR card

The PR card is an entry pass. Without their card, a Canadian resident cannot legally re-enter the country, but he/she can always apply to IRCC for a [travel document](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/new-immigrants/pr-travel-document.html){:target="_blank"}, so long as the applicant maintains the PR status.

An individual's residency status has nothing to do with their PR card’s expiration date. Similar to a passport, a PR card is nothing more than an official means of identification. Having an expired PR card does not mean that an individual’s PR status is lost. Similarly, having a valid PR card does not guarantee an individual's PR status, if this person doesn't satisfy the RO.


## Do I have to be physically present in Canada for 730 days to satisfy RO?

The short answer is: NO!

If you were outside Canada for more than 1095 days (that's the rest of five years), you may count days you spent outside Canada towards the days required for you to meet the residency obligation in these situations:

- [x] **Employment outside Canada:** you are an employee of, or under contract to, a Canadian business or the public service of Canada or of a Canadian province or territory; or
- [x] **Accompanying a Canadian citizen outside Canada:** you accompanied a Canadian citizen outside Canada as long as this person is your spouse, common-law partner or parent; or
- [x] **Accompanying a permanent resident outside Canada:** you accompanied a permanent resident if he/she falls into the above "Employment" category and your relationship falls into the above "Accompanying" category.

## I meet RO in past 5 years, but I didn't meet it before 5 years ago, am I good? 

Yes, you are good!

On Page 15, [Permanent Residency Status Determination](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/resources/manuals/op/op10-eng.pdf){:target="_blank"}, it says:


> For persons who have been permanent residents of Canada for more than five years, the only
five-year period that can be considered in calculating whether an applicant has met the
residency obligation is the one immediately before the application is received in the visa
office. A28(2)(b)(ii) precludes a visa officer from examining any period other than the most
recent five-year period immediately before the date of receipt of the application.

> Even if a person had resided away from Canada for many years, but returned to Canada and
resided there for a minimum of 730 days during the last five years, that person would comply
with the residency obligation and remain a permanent resident. An officer is not permitted to
consider just any five-year period in the applicant’s past, but must always assess the most
recent five-year period preceding the receipt of the application.

## Can I return to Canada as a PR after living outside for many years (failing to comply with RO)?

Usually you need a valid PR card to re-enter Canada. But if your PR card has expired, you may not apply for a PR travel document, as you need to prove you meet the RO in order to apply for travel document. 

Of course, not all airliners check your traveling documents thoroughly, and you may also enter Canada through land ports on US-Canada border by any transportation means. Now comes the question: 

**What a border services officer at CBSA will do with you?**

Cases like this are particularly tricky: 

Most of the success (enter into Canada without any consequences) depends on the actions of the officer handling your case. The officer is legally allowed to do one of two things: 

- allow the resident to freely enter the country; or 
- choose to initiate the revocation process of your PR status. 

!!! warning "The immigration officer will take several factors into account when making their decision:"
    - the amount of time the individual had spent outside of Canada after the initial five-year period had passed;
    - how often the individual left and re-entered the country previously;
    - what prompted the individual to return to Canada;
    - the residency status and location of the individual’s immediate family;
    - what caused the individual to fail to comply with the requirements of their status;
    - the individual’s status and ties to Canada (i.e., home ownership, family, employment, business, etc.)

In essence, the **only way** to “restore status” (that is, to enter Canada with an expired PR card or after failing to fulfill the two-year requirement) is to convince the officer to let you into Canada without any legal consequences. This can be done by providing documents to support your case and referring to applicable legislation.
