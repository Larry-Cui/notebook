## Background

Before 27 June 2023, foreign workers in Canada cannot enrol in any study programs that last longer than six month. Otherwise, he/she must apply for a study permit.

## New policy release

Starting from 27 June 2023, however, [IRCC](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship.html){:target="_blank"} implements a new policy called "[New measure to benefit foreign workers looking to improve their skills](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2023/06/new-measure-to-benefit-foreign-workers-looking-to-improve-their-skills.html){:target="_blank"}", removing the barrier on the way to foreign workers who would like to pursue a study program full time or part time while he/she is staying in Canada on a working permit status.

## Duration of the new policy
This is a 3-year temporary measure, which means it ends on 26 June 2026. However, history indicates that if a new policy receives positive feedbacks, it's very likely for IRCC to extend its duration or even make it a permanent one. 

## Benefits of the new policy

The imminent benefit the new policy brings is that any foreign workers on longer need to apply for a study permit for any program longer than 6 months. 

As the new policy says, many foreign professionals can "improve their education and receive more training, ... upskill or validate their foreign credentials through certain programs."

## Pay attention to drawbacks

For those who want to apply PR through [CEC](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/experience/qualifying-work-experience.html){:target="_blank"} stream, they should be very careful when relying on this policy to study after work.

> "Any Canadian work experience gained during a period of full-time study does not count toward eligibility for the Canadian Experience Class."

This means even if your body can handle a full time work and a full time study challenge, you will lose your credit on full time work experience. 

So for PR seekers who are relying on CEC stream, if you want to study while working, you get to study on part time. 

Then, it comes a new question: is there any foreign credentials validation program that are held on part time? 

Maybe yes, but a bad news for foreign lawyers is: 

[Foreign-Trained Lawyers Program](https://law.ucalgary.ca/future-students/post-jdllb-certificate-programs/foreign-trained-lawyers-program){:target="_blank"}, which is a program being held by some Canadian law schools that aiming to help foreign lawyers to get a Canadian lawyer license through an express path, has to be attended in person, full time.
