# Week 5: Notes and Quizzes

## Notes

??? note "5.1: Permanent residence status & residency requirements"

    - IRPA s27:
        - (1) A permanent resident of Canada has the right to enter and remain in Canada, subject to the provisions of this Act.
        - (2) A permanent resident must comply with any conditions imposed under the regulations or under instructions given under subsection 14.1(1).
    - Right of entry to Canada for PRs
        - Notice that the right of entry to Canada attaches to **Permanent Resident status**, not to any document such as the Permanent Resident card
        - PRs do not need a visa to enter Canada but need evidence that they meet s. 28 IRPA, and they are not eligible for a Canadian passport because they are not citizens
    - PR status is **permanent** unless/until it is **relinquished** or **revoked** through formal proceedings, whether or not the person has a valid PR card.
    - In the following scenarios a permanent resident would **lose status**:

        <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i> On a final determination under s. 109 IRPA to vacate a decision to allow their claim for **refugee protection** or a final determination to vacate a decision to allow their application for protection.

        <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i> When they become a Canadian **citizen**.

        <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i> On a final determination of a decision made outside of Canada that they have failed to comply with the **residency obligation** under section 28.

        <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i> On a final determination under subsection 108(2) IRPA that their **refugee** protection has ceased for any of the reasons described in paragraphs 108(1)(a) to (d).

    - Under s. 46 of the IRPA, simply being reported for **inadmissibility** does **NOT** cause a loss of status unless **a removal order** is made which then “comes into force”. We will discuss the meaning of “coming into force” shortly.
    - PR status is not truly permanent – it can be lost and a removal order can be issued if a PR becomes **inadmissible** under certain categories of inadmissibility.
    - PR breach of conditions: Failure to meet residency obligation (s. 28 IRPA) results in non-compliance with the Act (s. 41 IRPA).
    - PR inadmissibility:
        - Serious criminality (s. 36(2) IRPA)
        - Organized criminality/transnational crime (s. 37 IRPA)
        - Inadmissibility on the grounds of:
            - Security (s. 34 IRPA)
            - Human or international rights violations (s. 35 IRPA)
        - Misrepresentation (s. 40 IRPA)
        - Non-compliance with IRPA (s. 41 IRPA)
        - Inadmissible family member (s. 42 IRPA)
    - A permanent resident outside Canada who does not have a valid PR card to travel home may apply for a permanent resident **travel document** (s. 31(3) IRPA). A negative decision on such an application is called a “negative residency determination”, which can result in **a loss of status** if the person fails to appeal, or if the person appeals and loses.
    - In s. 46 of IRPA, PR status is not lost until either a final determination of a **decision** made outside of Canada that they have failed to comply with their residency obligation or until a **removal** order is made and it comes into force.
    - There is no “final determination” until **appeal** rights to the Immigration Appeal Division are **exhausted**.
    - Note that a negative residency determination made **inside Canada** or at the port of entry results in a **removal order**, while a residency determination made at a visa post outside Canada does not.
    - How can you demonstrate active listening to a client?
        - Active listening is both **verbal** and non-**verbal**
        - Verbal responses should be **non-judgmental**, and leading questions should be avoided
        - Non-verbal responses could be things like making eye contact, nodding, leaning forward slightly, and the occasional "mm-hmmm"
        - It is effective to **repeat** back to the client what they have told you, to let them know you are following what they say. It can also help to make sure you have not missed anything
    - How can you show empathy to your client?
        - **Empathy** and **sympathy** are different concepts – sympathy is simply feeling sorry for a person's circumstances, but empathy involves putting yourself in the client's shoes and attempting to truly identify with their experience
        - Empathy can be reflected in statements such as "That must have been embarrassing for you" or "That seems to have made you angry"
        - Empathy might also be reflected in your body language or facial expressions, such as exhibiting a look of genuine concern, or nodding your head (be aware however that different cultures may have different ways of expressing empathy)
    - How reliable is a person's non-verbal communication?
        - Non-verbal communication can be a very **valuable** source of information about a client's unspoken feelings, but it can also be **easily misunderstood**, especially when dealing cross-culturally. For example, in North American culture, eye contact means honesty. In other cultures, looking someone directly in the eye can be interpreted as disrespect.
        - It is therefore important to **reflect** your thoughts back to the client by asking questions or prompting discussion in order to confirm that your understanding is correct. For example, "I notice that you are moving around in your chair a lot. I am wondering what you are feeling."

## Quizzes

??? note "5.1 Chapter 4 of Cochran's Interviewing Skills"

    1. Which of the following might send you a signal that the client is highly-anxious?
        - [ ] Looking at the floor
        - [ ] Sweating
        - [ ] Fidgeting
        - [ ] Tears
        - [x] All of the above

    2. You are about to meet a very traumatized new refugee client. What might you do to make the client more comfortable and willing to open up to you?
        - [ ] Offer coffee or tea
        - [ ] Sit very close to the client
        - [ ] Minimize noise distractions
        - [ ] Set a plant on the table
        - [ ] Choose a less formal meeting room instead of the board room
        - [x] All of the above except B (sitting very close to the client may trigger fear, especially if there has been a sexual assault)
        - [ ] All of the above except D and E
        - [ ] None of the above

    3. True or False: There is no additional preparation required for an online interview.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**Preparation is vital for all interviews, but online interviews require even more preliminary work, including ensuring minimizing technical glitches and distractions (p. 69).**

    4. Which of the following is **NOT** an important reason to minimize visual and audio distractions during a client interview?
        - [x] The client might decide not to hire you ~ a client is unlikely to make this decision based only on distractions during the meeting, and in any event your focus should be on the client's needs
        - [ ] It short-changes the client if you fail to give them your full attention
        - [ ] The client may forget to mention important details
        - [ ] The client may feel unimportant to you
        - [ ] You might miss something that the client has said

    5. How might you make sure during the interview that the client remains focused?
        - [x] Give a subtle verbal cue such as "Do you have any questions about that?"
        - [ ] Ask them directly if they are paying attention (this is too confrontational, and is condescending)
        - [ ] Don't talk for long periods without stopping
        - [ ] Pay attention to their facial expressions and body language

    6. An example of an internal distractor that can negatively impact a client interview include:
        - [ ] Music playing in the background
        - [ ] The colour/décor of the room
        - [ ] Phone calls, text messages, and emails on your smartphone
        - [x] Things happening in your personal life
        <br>**Internal distractors that may impact your focus and attention include personal things going on in your life, biases, lack of sleep, hunger etc. (pp. 75-76).**

    7. You are interviewing a client who has experienced a stressful move recently. You notice that in the middle of the interview the client's attention is wandering.  A good strategy to refocus the client is to:
        - [ ] Carry on with the interview, the client will regain focus on their own.
        - [ ] Cut the interview short and reschedule the interview for another day/time
        - [x] Ask the client if they need a break to help refocus their attention
        - [ ] Call the client out on their lack of focus and remind the client that your time is valuable.
        <br>**Clients are subject to the same internal distractions that we are, and especially those who have experiences stress and trauma. As Cochran notes in Chapter 4, it is important to be sensitive to a client's ability to focus by demonstrating an empathic and flexible approach, such as inviting them to take a break or stretch their legs (pp. 77-78).**

    8. True or False: As an interviewer, you have no control over the physical environment that the interview takes place in.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**There are many aspects of the physical space that the interviewer has control over including the location, size of room, and distractions (pp. 72-74).**

    9. True or False:  To maintain professionalism, interviews should always be conducted in your office.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**While it may be the most professional setting, it may not always be possible or ideal to have an interview in your office.  Some clients may have difficulties (due to finances or disability) traveling to your office for a meeting (p. 74).**

    10. Which of the following is not an ideal way to prepare for an online interview?
        - [ ] Minimizing distractions in the background
        - [ ] Adjusting the camera to be at eye level
        - [ ] Ensure you have a strong internet connection
        - [x] Have all your notes and supporting documentation on the computer screen
        <br>**There are additional challenges and preparation required for online interviews, including ensuring that you have the technical requirements and supports to conduct an online interview, have minimized distractions in your background, have a professional appearance, and have the camera set up so that it is at eye level (pp. 69-72).  <span class="Coral">It is not recommended to have your screen cluttered with notes and documents that you read off the screen</span>.**

??? note "5.1 Module 5: Chapter 5 of Cochran's Interviewing Skills"

    1. According to Cochran, what are the three things that active listening communicates:
        - [ ] Content; Emotion; Response
        - [ ] Sympathy; Empathy; Understanding
        - [ ] Observation; Non-Verbal cues; Verbal communication;
        - [x] Interest; Understanding; Concern
        <br>**Cochran states that active listening communicates interest, understanding and concern (p. 102).**

    2. Which is the following is **NOT** a useful way to demonstrate empathy to a client?
        - [x] Kind phrases like, "I feel so sorry for you".
        - [ ] Eye contact
        - [ ] Facial expressions
        - [ ] Modulations of voice
        <br>**Choice "A" is an example of sympathy – it does not show the client that you are trying to put yourself in their shoes.**

    3. The hallmarks of **active listening** include:
        - [x] Use of minimally intrusive responses such as mm-hmm, is that so? really?
        - [x] Avoiding any comment that could be interpreted as judgmental.
        - [ ] Silence
        - [ ] Giving examples of your own similar experiences
        - [x] A and B
        - [ ] D and E
        - [ ] A and C
        - [ ] B and D

    4. Which of the following is **NOT** an attribute of a good listener:
        - [ ] Pays attention to what you are saying
        - [x] Asks lots of questions
        - [ ] Ignores distractions
        - [ ] Sends you verbal and non-verbal cues
        <br>**Under the section called "The Art of Listening" (pp. 90-91), Cochran sets out a few key attributes of a good listener. A good listener doesn't ask a lot of questions to fill up space, but is responsive and allows the other person to tell their story without interruption.**

    5. True or False:  About **90% of what we communicate is non-verbal** in nature.
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False
        <br>**In Chapter 5 (p. 85) Cochran states that as a rule of thumb 90% of what we communicate is non-verbal.**

    6. A good listener does the following:
        - [x] Conveys their interest in both what the speaker is saying and in the speaker themself
        - [ ] Interjects frequently to clarify points
        - [ ] Ensures the client knows the breadth of the listener’s expertise
        - [ ] Stops the client from straying into areas which are irrelevant

    7. True or False:  You should always make a digital recording of your interviews with clients in order to get an accurate account of all the information obtained.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**There are many reasons why it's may not be a good idea to record your client interviews, including that it might put off your clients, and it's time consuming to review the recording and transcribe it. As indicated in Chapter 5, a better option is to take good notes instead (p. 82).**

    8. Which of the following is **NOT** a good reason to avoid audio recording your client interview?
        - [x] If you make a mistake, there will be no proof – avoiding responsibility is not a good reason for anything – furthermore, if you’ve taken good notes then there will still be evidence of your error
        - [ ] May make the client uncomfortable and less apt to be forthcoming
        - [ ] Could generate mistrust with the client
        - [ ] Makes more work for the interviewer (reviewing the recording to take notes)
        - [ ] May put the client off

    9. Client needs are often entangled with legal and non-legal components. A reason why being attuned to the emotional aspects of your client's needs is important is because:
        - [x] Unless you deal with the emotional components of your client's needs, it will interfere with the legal aspects of their needs
        - [ ] Legal professionals have a responsibility and duty to solve their client's emotional concerns
        - [ ] It helps to categorize clients better in relation to their problems
        - [ ] All of the above
        <br>**Legal professionals are not therapists, however ignoring or diminishing a client's emotional needs hinders your ability to serve their legal needs.  Helping clients with their legal problems can often alleviate some of the emotional difficulties they are experiencing (p. 104).**

    10. Which if the following are good note-taking habits:
        - [x] Use the client’s own language when taking notes.
        - [x] Review the notes with the client before concluding the interview.
        - [x] Develop a shorthand or use a laptop to enable regular eye contact with client.
        - [ ] Use a red pen
        - [x] All but D

    11. True or False:  The best way to overcome any biases you observe in your own conduct is to ignore them
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**You should observe and pay close attention to your own perceptions and biases. At Cochran notes in Chapter 5, once your are aware of your biases you may be able to avoid the distortions they cause and create a more objective interviewing experience.**

    12. In a client interview setting **pauses and silences**:
        - [x] may provide surprising opportunities that produce valuable information
        - [ ] are something you should try to avoid at all costs
        - [ ] should be immediately filled with questions or comments
        - [ ] are always discomforting and awkward for clients
        <br>**Pauses and silences can be an effective non-verbal technique and are not always a negative thing to be avoided.  Deliberate use of pauses and silences can sometime be used as opportunities for clients to provide more information (p. 88).**

    13. The listening process can be broken down into two components: passive and active listening.  An example of good **active listening** is:
        - [ ] Silences to allow the interviewee an opportunity to speak
        - [ ] Gestures such as smiling and body language
        - [x] Comments that acknowledge the emotional content of what was said
        - [ ] Asking open-ended questions
        <br>**Good active listening involves responding to the speaker's comments to demonstrate you heard and understood the content and also acknowledging the emotional content of the comments (pp. 97-101). "B" This is an example of passive listening (pp. 94-95)**
