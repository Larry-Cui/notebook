# Week 5: Notes and Quizzes

## Notes

??? note "5.1: Permanent residence status & residency requirements"

    - IRPA s27:
        - (1) A permanent resident of Canada has the right to enter and remain in Canada, subject to the provisions of this Act.
        - (2) A permanent resident must comply with any conditions imposed under the regulations or under instructions given under subsection 14.1(1).
    - Right of entry to Canada for PRs
        - Notice that the right of entry to Canada attaches to **Permanent Resident status**, not to any document such as the Permanent Resident card
        - PRs do not need a visa to enter Canada but need evidence that they meet s. 28 IRPA, and they are not eligible for a Canadian passport because they are not citizens
    - PR status is **permanent** unless/until it is **relinquished** or **revoked** through formal proceedings, whether or not the person has a valid PR card.
    - In the following scenarios a permanent resident would **lose status**:

        <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i> On a final determination under s. 109 IRPA to vacate a decision to allow their claim for **refugee protection** or a final determination to vacate a decision to allow their application for protection.

        <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i> When they become a Canadian **citizen**.

        <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i> On a final determination of a decision made outside of Canada that they have failed to comply with the **residency obligation** under section 28.

        <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i> On a final determination under subsection 108(2) IRPA that their **refugee** protection has ceased for any of the reasons described in paragraphs 108(1)(a) to (d).

    - Under s. 46 of the IRPA, simply being reported for **inadmissibility** does **NOT** cause a loss of status unless **a removal order** is made which then “comes into force”. We will discuss the meaning of “coming into force” shortly.
    - PR status is not truly permanent – it can be lost and a removal order can be issued if a PR becomes **inadmissible** under certain categories of inadmissibility.
    - PR breach of conditions: Failure to meet residency obligation (s. 28 IRPA) results in non-compliance with the Act (s. 41 IRPA).
    - PR inadmissibility:
        - Serious criminality (s. 36(2) IRPA)
        - Organized criminality/transnational crime (s. 37 IRPA)
        - Inadmissibility on the grounds of:
            - Security (s. 34 IRPA)
            - Human or international rights violations (s. 35 IRPA)
        - Misrepresentation (s. 40 IRPA)
        - Non-compliance with IRPA (s. 41 IRPA)
        - Inadmissible family member (s. 42 IRPA)
    - A permanent resident outside Canada who does not have a valid PR card to travel home may apply for a permanent resident **travel document** (s. 31(3) IRPA). A negative decision on such an application is called a “negative residency determination”, which can result in **a loss of status** if the person fails to appeal, or if the person appeals and loses.
    - In s. 46 of IRPA, PR status is not lost until either a final determination of a **decision** made outside of Canada that they have failed to comply with their residency obligation or until a **removal** order is made and it comes into force.
    - There is no “final determination” until **appeal** rights to the Immigration Appeal Division are **exhausted**.
    - Note that a negative residency determination made **inside Canada** or at the port of entry results in a **removal order**, while a residency determination made at a visa post outside Canada does not.
    - How can you demonstrate active listening to a client?
        - Active listening is both **verbal** and non-**verbal**
        - Verbal responses should be **non-judgmental**, and leading questions should be avoided
        - Non-verbal responses could be things like making eye contact, nodding, leaning forward slightly, and the occasional "mm-hmmm"
        - It is effective to **repeat** back to the client what they have told you, to let them know you are following what they say. It can also help to make sure you have not missed anything
    - How can you show empathy to your client?
        - **Empathy** and **sympathy** are different concepts – sympathy is simply feeling sorry for a person's circumstances, but empathy involves putting yourself in the client's shoes and attempting to truly identify with their experience
        - Empathy can be reflected in statements such as "That must have been embarrassing for you" or "That seems to have made you angry"
        - Empathy might also be reflected in your body language or facial expressions, such as exhibiting a look of genuine concern, or nodding your head (be aware however that different cultures may have different ways of expressing empathy)
    - How reliable is a person's non-verbal communication?
        - Non-verbal communication can be a very **valuable** source of information about a client's unspoken feelings, but it can also be **easily misunderstood**, especially when dealing cross-culturally. For example, in North American culture, eye contact means honesty. In other cultures, looking someone directly in the eye can be interpreted as disrespect.
        - It is therefore important to **reflect** your thoughts back to the client by asking questions or prompting discussion in order to confirm that your understanding is correct. For example, "I notice that you are moving around in your chair a lot. I am wondering what you are feeling."
    - If the officer believes that the person is inadmissible for any reason, including non-compliance for violating the residency obligation, they can issue a **s.44 Report**.
    - The important take-away from s. 44(2) IRPA: The report is referred to the Minister’s delegate. If the person reviewing the report believes the report is well-founded, she **may**:
        - Refer the report to the Immigration Division for an admissibility hearing
        - Issue a removal order
        - Decide not to proceed with the matter (often based on H & C considerations)
    - Under s. 44(2) IRPA, if the Minister’s Delegate finds the report to be well-founded, they will either issue a removal order or refer the matter for a hearing in front of the Immigration Division of the IRB. This is governed by s. 228 IRPR.
    - Permanent residents always get a hearing before the Immigration Division **unless** the report is based only on failure to meet residency obligation, in which case a removal order is directly issued.
    - Due to the combined operation of **s. 36 of IRPA** (criminal inadmissibility) and **s. 64(2) of IRPA** (no right of appeal to the IAD), Mr. Sidhu faces the prospect of deportation without any evaluation of his personal circumstances.
    - s. 63(3) IRPA - A permanent resident or a protected person may **appeal** to the Immigration Appeal Division against a decision to make a removal order against them made under **subsection 44(2)** or made at an **admissibility hearing**.
    - s. 63(4) IRPA - A permanent resident may appeal to the Immigration **Appeal** Division against a decision made outside of Canada on the **residency obligation** under section 28.
    - The following permanent residents are **not eligible to appeal** their removal order (s. 64 IRPA):
        - Inadmissible on grounds of security, violating human or international rights, or organized criminality
        - Inadmissible for **serious criminality** (defined in s. 64(2) IRPA - includes crimes punished in Canada by a prison term of six months or more)
    - A removal order that may not be appealed to the IAD may be judicially reviewed in the Federal Court of Canada. The relevant limitation period is 15 days, because it is a decision made inside Canada. Only a lawyer has standing to represent a client in Federal Court.
    - s. 46 IRPA states that loss of PR status occurs when a removal order “comes into force” (becomes effective). Read s. 49(1) IRPA regarding when a removal order comes into force (becomes effective). A removal order comes into force on the latest of the following dates:
        - (a) the day the removal order is made, if there is no right to appeal;
        - (b) the day the appeal period expires, if there is a right to appeal and no appeal is made; and
        - (c) the day of the final determination of the appeal, if an appeal is made.
    - PR status is not lost until a removal order is made and it comes into force. At any point until this happens, PR status is retained along with full rights.
    - A s.44 Report is just an allegation until it is ruled upon, and even then if there is a right of appeal to the IAD, the decision is not final.

    - 3 (1) The objectives of this Act with respect to immigration are:
        - (d) to see that **families are reunited in Canada**;
    - Highlights of the sponsorship program include:
        - a modern definition of "**family**" that includes common law, conjugal, and same-sex partners;
        - a definition of "dependent child" that recognizes the dependency of children up to **22** years of age
        - a sponsorship stream for parents and grandparents that requires a **consecutive three-year** pattern of elevated financial stability for the sponsor
        - a provision for adoption, in keeping with the principle of the "best interests of the child," that leads **directly to citizenship for the adoptee** if one of the adopting parents is a Canadian citizen
        - the **length** of a sponsorship undertaking, which ranges from three to 20 years, depending on the relationship to the sponsor
    - Who is eligible to be sponsored as a member of the family class?
        - a spouse, common-law partner or conjugal partner
        - a dependent child, an adopted child
        - the sponsor's parents, grandparents
        - an orphaned brother/sister, niece/nephew or grandchild, if under 18
        - a person under 18 years of age whom the sponsor intends to adopt in Canada (subject to certain conditions)
        - one other relative, if the sponsor is completely alone in Canada and has no other sponsorable relative
    - Spouse definition:
        - A legal marriage partner. The term "spouse" includes both opposite- and same-sex relationships but does not include common-law partnerships.
        - Opposite and same-sex marriages will be recognized for immigration purposes, where the marriage:
            - was legally performed in Canada
            - if performed outside of Canada, the marriage must be legally valid in the country where it took place and in Canada
    - Common-law partner definition:
        - According to s.1 IRPR , "Common-law partner means, in relation to a person, an individual who is cohabiting with the person in a conjugal relationship, having so cohabited for a period of at least **one** year. (conjoint de fait)"
        - The term "common-law partner" refers to both opposite-sex and same-sex couples
        - A common-law partner may be a principal applicant or a family member
        - Cohabitation must take place over a **continuous 12-month period**
    - Conjugal partner definition:
        - According to s.2 of IRPR , "Conjugal partner means, in relation to a sponsor, a foreign national residing outside Canada who is in a conjugal relationship with the sponsor and has been in that relationship for a period of at least one year. (partenaire conjugal)"
        - **A conjugal partner is someone who could not live with the sponsor as a couple because of reasons beyond their control** (e.g., immigration barrier, religious reasons or sexual orientation)
        - The term "conjugal partner" applies to both opposite and same-sex couples
        - You can sponsor a conjugal partner if there is a significant degree of attachment between the two of you, implying not just a physical relationship but a mutually interdependent relationship
        - It is up to counsel to establish a list of documents to demonstrate the conjugal nature of the relationship
    - *Leroux v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, 2007 FC 403:
        - Recognizes that there may be restrictions that apply because the partners live in different countries that may have different moral **standards**, which can affect the degree of tolerance for conjugal relationships, especially for same-sex partners
        - Nevertheless, the alleged conjugal relationship must have **a sufficient number of features** of a marriage to show that it is more than just a means of entering Canada
    - *Banh v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, 2013 CanLII 98046 (CA IRB):
        - Test for a bona fide marriage: All applications for permanent residence have, of course, the goal of acquiring status but that **general intent** is distinguishable from cases where the evidence shows, on a balance of probabilities, that it was a **primary purpose** of the relationship to acquire any status or privilege under the Act.
    - Dependent child definition:
        - (a) has one of the following relationships with the parent, namely,
            - (i) is the **biological** child of the parent, if the child has not been adopted by a person other than the spouse or common-law partner of the parent, or
            - (ii) is the **adopted** child of the parent; and
        - (b) is in one of the following situations of dependency, namely,
            - (i) is less than **22** years of age and is not a spouse or common-law partner, or
            - (ii) is 22 years of age or older and has **depended substantially** on the financial support of the parent since before attaining the age of 22 years and is unable to be financially self-supporting due to a physical or mental condition. (enfant à charge)
    - "Adoption", for greater certainty, means an adoption that creates a **legal** parent-child relationship and **severs** the pre-existing legal parent-child relationship.
    - "Orphaned child", according to 117(1) of the IRPR: A foreign national is a member of the family class if, with respect to a sponsor, the foreign national is​
        - (f) a person whose parents are deceased, who is under 18 years of age, who is not a spouse or common-law partner and who is
            - (i) a child of the sponsor’s mother or father,​
            - (ii) a child of a child of the sponsor’s mother or father, or​
            - (iii) a child of the sponsor’s child
    - According to 117(1) of the IRPR:
        - In case of divorce or separation, the client can sponsor their parents’ and grandparents’ **spouses**, or conjugal or common-law partners
        - In the application, the client can only include their **brothers and sisters**, or half brothers and sisters if they qualify as **dependent** children of the parents.
        - A client can’t sponsor their spouse’s parents and grandparents (their in-laws)​, **but** they can be a co-signer on their in-laws’ application.
    - According to IRPR s.117(9), four categories of excluded relationships:
        - **Underage:** (a) the foreign national is the sponsor’s spouse, common-law partner or conjugal partner and is under **18** years of age
        - **Multiple marriage:** (c) the foreign national is the sponsor’s spouse and​ (i) the sponsor or the foreign national was, at the time of their marriage, the spouse of another person
        - **Proxy marriage:** (c.1) the foreign national is the sponsor’s spouse and if at the time the marriage ceremony was conducted either one or both of the spouses were not physically present unless the foreign national was marrying a person who was not physically present at the ceremony as a result of their service as a member of the Canadian Forces and the marriage is valid both under the laws of the jurisdiction where it took place and under Canadian law
        - **Undeclared dependents:** (d) subject to subsection (10), the sponsor previously made an application for permanent residence and became a permanent resident and, at the time of that application, the foreign national was a non-accompanying family member of the sponsor and was not examined.
    - Basic requirements to be a sponsor:
        - must be a Canadian citizen or permanent resident who
            - is at least 18 years of age;
            - resides in Canada (A sponsor who is a Canadian citizen and does not reside in Canada may sponsor if the sponsor will reside in Canada when the foreign national becomes a permanent resident)
        - Five-year Requirement
            - A permanent resident or a naturalized Canadian citizen who has previously been sponsored as a spouse or a common law or conjugal partner under s. 13(1) of the IRPA may not sponsor a new spouse or partner for a **five-year** period after becoming a permanent resident.
    - When must the sponsor meet the requirements in R133?
        - "A sponsorship application shall only be approved by an officer if, on the day on which the application was filed and from that day until the day a decision is made with respect to the application, there is evidence that the sponsor" meets all the requirements.​
        - In other words, the sponsor must meet all requirements **from the day of filing right through until the day a decision is made**.​
    - **MNI** applies to most Family Class sponsorships but does **not** apply to:
        - a sponsor’s spouse, common law partner or conjugal partner​
        - the sponsor’s spouse’s dependent children, as long as they have no children of their own​
        - the sponsor’s dependent child as long as they have no children of their own
    - MNI case study: Magda is a Canadian citizen. Her sister Maryam is also Canadian. Magda is married with two children, aged 23 and 20. She now wants to sponsor her mother to immigrate to Canada. Her father does not wish to immigrate at this time.
        - What is the correct number of family members for which Magda needs to meet Minimum Necessary Income? **Five persons** – Magda plus her husband plus one dependent child under the age of 22, plus her mother and her father even though he is non-accompanying.
        - Can Magda’s sister co-sign if Magda does not meet the income threshold? **No!** Magda’s sister cannot be a co-signer. Her husband could co-sign. See R 132(5).
    - For parents and grandparents, a sponsor must first be "**invited to apply**" before submitting a sponsorship application. Read more about this process in the IRCC guidance on "How will the 2020 Parents and Grandparents Program intake process work?"​

## Quizzes

??? note "5.1 Chapter 4 of Cochran's Interviewing Skills"

    1. Which of the following might send you a signal that the client is highly-anxious?
        - [ ] Looking at the floor
        - [ ] Sweating
        - [ ] Fidgeting
        - [ ] Tears
        - [x] All of the above

    2. You are about to meet a very traumatized new refugee client. What might you do to make the client more comfortable and willing to open up to you?
        - [ ] Offer coffee or tea
        - [ ] Sit very close to the client
        - [ ] Minimize noise distractions
        - [ ] Set a plant on the table
        - [ ] Choose a less formal meeting room instead of the board room
        - [x] All of the above except B (sitting very close to the client may trigger fear, especially if there has been a sexual assault)
        - [ ] All of the above except D and E
        - [ ] None of the above

    3. True or False: There is no additional preparation required for an online interview.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**Preparation is vital for all interviews, but online interviews require even more preliminary work, including ensuring minimizing technical glitches and distractions (p. 69).**

    4. Which of the following is **NOT** an important reason to minimize visual and audio distractions during a client interview?
        - [x] The client might decide not to hire you ~ a client is unlikely to make this decision based only on distractions during the meeting, and in any event your focus should be on the client's needs
        - [ ] It short-changes the client if you fail to give them your full attention
        - [ ] The client may forget to mention important details
        - [ ] The client may feel unimportant to you
        - [ ] You might miss something that the client has said

    5. How might you make sure during the interview that the client remains focused?
        - [x] Give a subtle verbal cue such as "Do you have any questions about that?"
        - [ ] Ask them directly if they are paying attention (this is too confrontational, and is condescending)
        - [ ] Don't talk for long periods without stopping
        - [ ] Pay attention to their facial expressions and body language

    6. An example of an internal distractor that can negatively impact a client interview include:
        - [ ] Music playing in the background
        - [ ] The colour/décor of the room
        - [ ] Phone calls, text messages, and emails on your smartphone
        - [x] Things happening in your personal life
        <br>**Internal distractors that may impact your focus and attention include personal things going on in your life, biases, lack of sleep, hunger etc. (pp. 75-76).**

    7. You are interviewing a client who has experienced a stressful move recently. You notice that in the middle of the interview the client's attention is wandering.  A good strategy to refocus the client is to:
        - [ ] Carry on with the interview, the client will regain focus on their own.
        - [ ] Cut the interview short and reschedule the interview for another day/time
        - [x] Ask the client if they need a break to help refocus their attention
        - [ ] Call the client out on their lack of focus and remind the client that your time is valuable.
        <br>**Clients are subject to the same internal distractions that we are, and especially those who have experiences stress and trauma. As Cochran notes in Chapter 4, it is important to be sensitive to a client's ability to focus by demonstrating an empathic and flexible approach, such as inviting them to take a break or stretch their legs (pp. 77-78).**

    8. True or False: As an interviewer, you have no control over the physical environment that the interview takes place in.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**There are many aspects of the physical space that the interviewer has control over including the location, size of room, and distractions (pp. 72-74).**

    9. True or False:  To maintain professionalism, interviews should always be conducted in your office.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**While it may be the most professional setting, it may not always be possible or ideal to have an interview in your office.  Some clients may have difficulties (due to finances or disability) traveling to your office for a meeting (p. 74).**

    10. Which of the following is not an ideal way to prepare for an online interview?
        - [ ] Minimizing distractions in the background
        - [ ] Adjusting the camera to be at eye level
        - [ ] Ensure you have a strong internet connection
        - [x] Have all your notes and supporting documentation on the computer screen
        <br>**There are additional challenges and preparation required for online interviews, including ensuring that you have the technical requirements and supports to conduct an online interview, have minimized distractions in your background, have a professional appearance, and have the camera set up so that it is at eye level (pp. 69-72).  <span class="Coral">It is not recommended to have your screen cluttered with notes and documents that you read off the screen</span>.**

??? note "5.1 Module 5: Chapter 5 of Cochran's Interviewing Skills"

    1. According to Cochran, what are the three things that active listening communicates:
        - [ ] Content; Emotion; Response
        - [ ] Sympathy; Empathy; Understanding
        - [ ] Observation; Non-Verbal cues; Verbal communication;
        - [x] Interest; Understanding; Concern
        <br>**Cochran states that active listening communicates interest, understanding and concern (p. 102).**

    2. Which is the following is **NOT** a useful way to demonstrate empathy to a client?
        - [x] Kind phrases like, "I feel so sorry for you".
        - [ ] Eye contact
        - [ ] Facial expressions
        - [ ] Modulations of voice
        <br>**Choice "A" is an example of sympathy – it does not show the client that you are trying to put yourself in their shoes.**

    3. The hallmarks of **active listening** include:
        - [x] Use of minimally intrusive responses such as mm-hmm, is that so? really?
        - [x] Avoiding any comment that could be interpreted as judgmental.
        - [ ] Silence
        - [ ] Giving examples of your own similar experiences
        - [x] A and B
        - [ ] D and E
        - [ ] A and C
        - [ ] B and D

    4. Which of the following is **NOT** an attribute of a good listener:
        - [ ] Pays attention to what you are saying
        - [x] Asks lots of questions
        - [ ] Ignores distractions
        - [ ] Sends you verbal and non-verbal cues
        <br>**Under the section called "The Art of Listening" (pp. 90-91), Cochran sets out a few key attributes of a good listener. A good listener doesn't ask a lot of questions to fill up space, but is responsive and allows the other person to tell their story without interruption.**

    5. True or False:  About **90% of what we communicate is non-verbal** in nature.
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False
        <br>**In Chapter 5 (p. 85) Cochran states that as a rule of thumb 90% of what we communicate is non-verbal.**

    6. A good listener does the following:
        - [x] Conveys their interest in both what the speaker is saying and in the speaker themself
        - [ ] Interjects frequently to clarify points
        - [ ] Ensures the client knows the breadth of the listener’s expertise
        - [ ] Stops the client from straying into areas which are irrelevant

    7. True or False:  You should always make a digital recording of your interviews with clients in order to get an accurate account of all the information obtained.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**There are many reasons why it's may not be a good idea to record your client interviews, including that it might put off your clients, and it's time consuming to review the recording and transcribe it. As indicated in Chapter 5, a better option is to take good notes instead (p. 82).**

    8. Which of the following is **NOT** a good reason to avoid audio recording your client interview?

    11. True or False:  The best way to overcome any biases you observe in your own conduct is to ignore them
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**You should observe and pay close attention to your own perceptions and biases. At Cochran notes in Chapter 5, once your are aware of your biases you may be able to avoid the distortions they cause and create a more objective interviewing experience.**

    12. In a client interview setting **pauses and silences**:
        - [x] may provide surprising opportunities that produce valuable information
        - [ ] are something you should try to avoid at all costs
        - [ ] should be immediately filled with questions or comments
        - [ ] are always discomforting and awkward for clients
        <br>**Pauses and silences can be an effective non-verbal technique and are not always a negative thing to be avoided.  Deliberate use of pauses and silences can sometime be used as opportunities for clients to provide more information (p. 88).**

    13. The listening process can be broken down into two components: passive and active listening.  An example of good **active listening** is:
        - [ ] Silences to allow the interviewee an opportunity to speak
        - [ ] Gestures such as smiling and body language
        - [x] Comments that acknowledge the emotional content of what was said
        - [ ] Asking open-ended questions
