# Week 5: Notes and Quizzes

## Notes

???+ note "5.1: Permanent residence status & residency requirements"

    - IRPA s27:
        - (1) A permanent resident of Canada has the right to enter and remain in Canada, subject to the provisions of this Act.
        - (2) A permanent resident must comply with any conditions imposed under the regulations or under instructions given under subsection 14.1(1).
    - Right of entry to Canada for PRs
        - Notice that the right of entry to Canada attaches to **Permanent Resident status**, not to any document such as the Permanent Resident card
        - PRs do not need a visa to enter Canada but need evidence that they meet s. 28 IRPA, and they are not eligible for a Canadian passport because they are not citizens
    - PR status is **permanent** unless/until it is **relinquished** or **revoked** through formal proceedings, whether or not the person has a valid PR card.
    - In the following scenarios a permanent resident would **lose status**:

        <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i> On a final determination under s. 109 IRPA to vacate a decision to allow their claim for **refugee protection** or a final determination to vacate a decision to allow their application for protection.

        <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i> When they become a Canadian **citizen**.

        <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i> On a final determination of a decision made outside of Canada that they have failed to comply with the **residency obligation** under section 28.

        <i class="fa-solid fa-circle-xmark"></i> On a final determination under subsection 108(2) IRPA that their **refugee** protection has ceased for any of the reasons described in paragraphs 108(1)(a) to (d).

    - Under s. 46 of the IRPA, simply being reported for **inadmissibility** does **NOT** cause a loss of status unless **a removal order** is made which then “comes into force”. We will discuss the meaning of “coming into force” shortly.
