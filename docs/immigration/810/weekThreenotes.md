# Week 3: Notes and Quizzes

## Notes

??? note "3.1 Introduction to Administrative Law"

      - Three areas of public law: constitutional law, criminal law and administrative law
      - Administrative law ensures that:
          - government actions are **authorized** by Parliament (or provincial legislatures)
          - laws are implemented in a **fair and reasonable** ( and sometimes, correct) manner
          - government decisions must be **legal** and individuals must have **remedies**
      - Besides immigration and citizenship law, administrative law also engaged in
          - Human rights
          - Extradition
          - Regulation of professions
          - others
      - **Jurisdiction**: the scope of the authority or powers conferred on a government body or official by legislation or by common law
      - **Discretion**: the power of a government official or agency to decide a course of action from among a variety of options available under the law
      - **Procedural fairness**: a decision-maker acting under a statutory power of decision must give any person whose rights, privileges or interests are affected by a decision reasonable notice of the case they have to meet and an opportunity to respond; and must be impartial.
      - **Rule against sub-delegation**: the principle that the particular person to whom a power or authority has been delegated may not re-delegate that power to someone else unless clearly authorized to do so by law.
      - **Subordinate legislation**: legislation made by a body other than Parliament or a provincial legislature (such as Cabinet, a Cabinet minister, an agency or a municipal council), as authorized by statute; generally includes regulations, proclamations, rules, orders, ministerial instructions or other instruments; also called “delegated legislation”; distinguished from statutes (or “acts”).
      - **Judicial review**: the exercise by a superior or other court granted authority by statute of its supervisory authority over ministries and other government agencies by reviewing whether they have carried out their functions in accordance with the principles of administrative law. *The Federal Court of Canada is the court of first instance for judicial review of immigration and citizenship matters*.
      - Courts should **defer to** decisions made by administrators
      - Governments may take actions that limit activities of citizens or their access to rights/benefits **only in accordance with substantive and procedural requirements prescribed by law**
      - The **rule of law** means government actors and decision -makers have powers/duties **limited by law** and must follow procedures set out in legislation when exercising them
      - *Roncarelli v Duplessis*, 1959 CanLII 50 (SCC), Headnote:
          - the cancellation of the permit was the result of an order given by the defendant to the manager of the Commission.
          - There was no authority enabling the defendant to direct the cancellation of a permit. The intent and purpose of that Act placed complete control over the liquor traffic in the hands of an independent commission.
          - Cancellation of a permit by the Commission, at the request or upon the direction of a third party, as was done in this case, was not a proper and valid exercise of the powers.

??? note "3.2 Fairness and the Right to be Heard"

    - Procedural fairness has two main components: the right to be heard, the right to an impartial decision.
    - *Nicholson v Haldimand-Norfolk Regional Police Commissioners*, 1978 CanLII 24 (SCC): The appellant should have been told why his services were no longer required and given an opportunity to respond. While the appellant could not claim the procedural protections of a constable with more than eighteen month’s service, he should have been treated ‘fairly’ not arbitrarily.
    - Following *Nicholson*, Canadian procedural fairness case law was marked by the gradual expansion of ==the duty of fairness to all areas== of administrative decision making affecting an individual’s rights, privileges and interests.
    - *Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)*, 1999 CanLII 699 (SCC): **legitimate expectation?** Pass. **explanation for a decision?** Pass. **Reasonable apprehension of bias?** Fail, the immigration officer’s notes gave the impression that he may have been drawing conclusions based not on the evidence before him, but on the fact that the appellant was a single mother with several children and had been diagnosed with a psychiatric illness.
    - *Baker* is described as the "**most significant administrative law judgments ever delivered by the Supreme Court of Canada” because of its comprehensive discussion of administrative law principles**".
    - 5 factors to determine the degree of procedural fairness ("Baker Factors"):
        - Nature of the decision and process followed in making it: decisions that more closely resemble judicial decisions will more likely to require procedural protections akin to a trial
        - Nature of the statutory scheme: where there is no appeal procedure, procedural protections will be greater
        - Importance of the decision to person affected: decisions with significant consequences will require more procedural protections
        - Legitimate expectations of the parties: where a clear representation or promise as to the procedure to be followed is provided by the decision-maker, it is unfair to act contrary to that promise
        - The procedures chosen by the tribunal or decision-makers themselves: courts give weight to these choices
    - Not every administrative law decision will attract the duty to give reasons. Also, the duty to give reasons will vary according to the type of decision. However, the absence of reasons when circumstances dictate they are required, may serve as a basis for review under the duty of fairness
    - Sources of Procedural Fairness:
        - The *Citizenship Act*: prescribes application procedures in Part V of the Act while Part II of the Act prescribes fairly elaborate procedures for citizenship revocation.
        - The *IRPA*:
            - largely silent as to the procedures to be followed for most immigration matters.
            - An important exception concerns the IRB.
        - the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations* (IRPR) and the *Citizenship Regulations* do not include detailed procedural rules. However, the IRPR does impose some broad procedural parameters, including the default written nature of the hearing, and the right to representation.
        - policy instruments, including guidelines, program delivery instructions, operational manuals and operational bulletins, tend to be the ==most important source== of procedural entitlements, generating the right under the ==legitimate expectations== doctrine.
            - An important policy instrument in relation to all types of immigration and citizenship decision-making - outside the IRB context - is IRCC's [operational instructions on procedural fairness](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/procedural-fairness.html){:target="\_blank"}.
        - The common law or judge-made principles are another important source of procedural rights.
        - The *Constitution* and the *Charter*.
    - One important exception to the right to be heard: administrative decisions of a legislative nature may ==not== engage any entitlement to procedural fairness. In *Canadian Doctors for Refugee Care v Canada (Attorney General)*, 2014 FC 651, the Court provided that legislature did not give rise to participatory rights for the potentially infinite group of stakeholders.
    - Immigration decision makers disclose the information they rely upon in coming to a decision: the more significant the **interests** at stake, the more substantial the likely **impact** on these interests, and the more **adjudicative** (rather than regulatory or policy-driven) the proceeding, the greater the extent of disclosure.
    - [IRCC's operational instructions on procedural fairness](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/procedural-fairness.html){:target="\_blank"}:
        - processing without undue delay
        - fair and impartial decision-making
        - right to be heard
        - whoever hears must decide
        - legitimate expectation
        - decisions based on IRPA and IRPR
        - reasons of a decision

    |For written applications (CBSA or IRCC)| For oral interviews (CBSA or IRCC)| For oral hearings (IRB)|
    |---|---|---|
    |Notice and disclosure|Notice and disclosure|Notice and disclosure|
    |Right to be represented|Right to be represented (but may include limits on oral submissions or right to object)|Right to be represented|

??? note "3.3 Fairness and Impartiality"

    - Test for Reasonable Apprehension of Bias (**RAB**): [T]he apprehension of bias must be a reasonable one, held by reasonable and right minded persons, applying themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the required information. That test is ‘what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically – and having thought the matter through – conclude.
    - threshold for establishing RAB: the threshold for establishing such a claim is **high**, and whether a reasonable apprehension of bias arises will depend entirely upon the **facts of the case**.
    - 4 indicators of possible bias:
        - conflict of interest
        - Personal relationships
        - Prior knowledge of facts (that are prejudicial to one of the parties)
        - A predisposition toward an outcome
    - Government officials are generally **free** to consult with other staff members when making decisions and are generally not required to notify the parties that have done so.
    - An adjudicator can seek advice, including talking things over with other adjudicators or seeking advice from their agency’s legal counsel about risk, as long as:
        - They make the final **decision**,
        - The consultation is **voluntary**,
        - No one puts **pressure** on the adjudicator to make a certain decision, and
        - No new issues or facts are **introduced** without parties being notified and permitted to comment.
    - At the first available opportunity: raise an allegation of RAB as early as possible

??? note "3.4: Judicial Review"

    - Achieving a high-level understanding of the **procedures**, the kinds of **errors** that prompt a reviewing court to intervene, and the **relief** available, are the main learning goals of this subunit.
    - Immigration consultants are **not permitted** to apply for judicial review or represent clients in judicial review hearings。
    - Where internal appellate remedies are prescribed by the IRPA, those must be exhausted first.
    - An H & C refusal can only be challenged by judicial review in the Federal Court of Canada.
    - Provincial superior courts may also hear applications for *habeas corpus* (A “writ” of *habeas corpus* is used to bring a prisoner or other detainee before the court to determine the lawfulness of the detention) from persons demanding to know whether their immigration detention is justified in law.
    - During a Federal Court Judicial Review hearing, the person whose case is the subject of the review **does not testify**.
    - Applications for judicial review are commenced with leave. Decisions on leave applications are rendered in a summary way which generally means in writing and without any reasons. **Leave decisions are not subject to appeal**.
    - **No appeal** lies from the decision of the Court with respect to the application.
    - Judicial review applications proceed in five basic stages:
        - Application for Leave
        - "Perfect Application" (Application Record)
        - Decision: Leave granted / not granted
        - If granted, further materials filed
        - Hearing is held
    - Grounds of judicial review:
        - acted without jurisdiction, acted beyond its jurisdiction or refused to exercise its jurisdiction;
        - failed to observe a principle of procedural fairness;
        - erred in law;
        - erroneous findings of fact;
        - fraud or perjured evidence;
        - contrary to law.
    - Courts show this respect by deferring to the tribunal in certain cases – that is, by accepting its decision even if they disagree with it.
    - the Supreme Court established a presumption that **reasonableness** is the applicable standard of review in all cases.
    - On judicial review, the court **usually does not substitute** its decision for that of the decision-maker.
    - In the immigration and citizenship context, the *Federal Courts Act* codifies the available remedies. However, you may find references to these writs in older case law so it is helpful to understand the terminology:
        - ***Certiorari***: This is the most common; it involves quashing the decision and remitting it back for redetermination (usually by a different decision-maker)
        - ***Mandamus***: An order requiring a party to perform a specific legal duty that the decision-maker has failed to perform
        - ***Prohibition***: An order requiring a party not to do something
        - ***Habeas Corpus***: An order determining the legality of detention (“free the body”)
        - ***Quo Warranto***: This is the least common; it is used to challenge a person's entitlement to a public office that they purport to occupy and exercise
    - Once a question is certified, the Federal Court of Appeal is not restricted to considering the certified question but may consider all issues raised by the appeal (*Baker*, at [para. 12](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1999/1999canlii699/1999canlii699.html){:target="\_blank"} )

??? note "3.5 The Constitution and the Charter"

    - The Constitution Act of 1867 provides that immigration is a matter that is subject to concurrent or shared jurisdiction between the two levels of government. Nevertheless, the federal government has been the **dominant** player in this sphere.
    - *Law Society of BC v. Mangat*. The Law Society of BC unsuccessfully challenged a provision of the former Immigration Act which permitted immigration consultants to represent individuals before the IRB.​

???+ note "3.6 The Evolution of the United Nations and the International Human Rights Framework"

    - The ***Magna Carta*** of 1215 is widely considered to be one of the precursors to today’s international human rights framework.
    - Although there are 63 clauses in the Magna Carta, those that were foundational to evolving ideas about the rule of law and remain applicable today are clauses 39 and 40:

    > “[39] No free man shall be seized, imprisoned, dispossessed, outlawed, exiled or ruined in any way, nor in any way proceeded against, except by the lawful judgement of his peers and the law of the land."

    > “[40] To no one will we sell, to no one will we deny or delay right or justice.”

    - Today’s international human rights framework emerged in the immediate aftermath of the devastation of World War II.
    - International	law comes from a variety of sources. The two most significant are **customary international law** and **treaty law**. Customary international law is considered to be part of Canadian law to the extent that it modifies the common law. Treaty law is not considered to be part of Canadian law **unless** is has been duly passed into a Canadian statute by federal parliament or a provincial legislature, or in some cases both bodies.
    - Canada's ‘**dualist**’ approach to international law: Once the executive has ratified a treaty, other states can call upon Canada to honour its treaty commitments, but those commitments will not be part of Canadian law until either federal parliament or a provincial legislature has passed them into domestic statute.
    - International Law as an Advocacy Tool”: individual petition or complaint system and country reports.

## Quizzes

??? note "3.1 Administrative Law"

    1. Which of the following decisions typically would not attract a duty to act fairly?
        - [ ] Issuing a license to drive a taxi
        - [ ] Issuing a permit to build a septic system
        - [ ] Granting social assistance benefits
        - [x] Issuing immigration policy documents
        <br>**Legislative or policy decisions establishing rules or guidelines are generally not subject to the duty to act fairly. See Nastasi et al., Chapter 2 “Foundations of Administrative Law” , p. 40-41.**

    2. Administrative law applies to:
        - [ ] the relationship between levels of Canadian government
        - [ ] administrative agencies, tribunals and government decision-makers
        - [ ] the exercise of powers granted by statute
        - [x] B and C
        <br>**A is incorrect because the relationship between levels of government in Canada is governed by the ==Constitution==, not administrative law.**

    3. Which best describes the relationship between procedural fairness and natural justice?
        - [ ] Procedural fairness requires every decision maker to attend to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in making decisions whereas natural justice requires every decision maker to attend to the common law principles only.
        - [ ] Procedural fairness is the standard required of all agencies, including tribunals; whereas natural justice is the set of principles constituting fair procedure.
        - [ ] Procedural fairness requires that a person affected by a decision be given a formal hearing; whereas natural justice requires that the person be allowed to speak at their hearing.
        - [x] None of the above
        <br>**While natural justice was once seen as being distinct from procedural fairness, today the terms natural justice and procedural fairness are synonymous and can be used ==interchangeably== – as noted in Nastasi et al, Chapter 2 "Foundations of Administrative Law", p. 25.**

    4. True or false: Sarah Dunn is a newly appointed panel member with the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the IRB. Ms. Dunn was the sole decision-maker hearing a refugee claim and is unsure how she should decide the case. She decides to meet with two more experienced RPD members to consult with them on the case she just heard. This is not permissible under any circumstances.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**==Tribunal members are permitted to consult one another except where statutory limits or prohibitions are placed== on the right to consult. Therefore, absent an exclusion or limitation in the IRPA, the enabling legislation of the IRB, Ms. Dunn is free to consult other tribunal members when making decisions. However, Ms. Dunn must be the one making the final decision; the consultation must be voluntary; no one can put pressure on her to make a particular decision; and no new issues or facts are to be introduced without the claimant being notified and permitted to comment. See, Nastasi et al., Chapter 2 “Foundations of Administrative Law” , p. 34.**

    5. Which of the following is not something courts can generally do when hearing judicial review applications?
        - [ ] Declare that the action taken by a public official is contrary to the law
        - [ ] Order an official or agency to take any action required by law
        - [ ] Order an agency to follow a fair procedure in making a decision
        - [x] Declare that the administrative tribunal be disbanded
        <br>**As noted in Nastasi et al, Chapter 2 “Foundations of Administrative Law” at ==p. 54==, courts hearing judicial review applications can do A, B, and C in addition to quashing a decision already made, forbid a public official from taking or continuing any action that is prohibited by law; and order an agency to free a person who is illegally imprisoned. However, disbanding an administrative tribunal is not an available remedy on judicial review.**

    6. What test is used to determine whether or not a tribunal is impartial?
        - [ ] Actual bias
        - [ ] Institutional bias
        - [x] Reasonable apprehension of bias
        - [ ] Probability of bias
        <br>**As noted in Nastasi et al., in Chapter 2 “Foundations of Administrative Law” at p. 42, the test that has emerged from the case law is whether there is a “reasonable apprehension of bias” – not actual bias.**

    7. Which of the following is ==not true== about guidelines?
        - [ ] Policies and guidelines can be used to promote consistency and fairness in decision-making.
        - [x] Guidelines may be used to exclude choices provided by the law.
        - [ ] Guidelines must not be treated as binding.
        - [ ] Requiring government decision-makers to follow guidelines would be fettering of discretion.
        <br>**Guidelines are not treated as binding rules and should not be used to justify the exclusion of choices provided by the law. See, Nastasi et al., Chapter 2 “Foundations of Administrative Law” , pp. 33-34.**

    8. Which of the following doctrines is an exception to the general rule that there is no duty for government bodies and officials to consult with the public or with individuals for policy or minor administrative decisions?
        - [ ] Inherent powers doctrine
        - [ ] Procedural fairness doctrine
        - [x] Legitimate expectation doctrine
        - [ ] Implied powers doctrine
        <br>**Where a decision maker raises expectations that a certain procedure will be followed, either by promises or by a course of action on which people have come to rely, the decision maker may not change its practice or procedure where the change will have an adverse effect without first notifying the persons who will be affected and giving them an opportunity to comment on the proposed change. See, Nastasi et al., Chapter 2, at p. 40.**

    9. True or false: all Canadian courts have the power to judicially review decisions of administrative bodies.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**only ==superior== courts have the inherent power to review an alleged violation by an official or body.**

    10. The process whereby superior courts review alleged violations by an official or body of any fundamental principles of administrative law is known as:
        - [ ] Administrative review
        - [ ] Judicial oversight
        - [x] Judicial review
        - [ ] Administrative oversight
        <br>**See, Nastasi et al, Chapter 2 "Foundations of Administrative Law", p. 53.**

    11. A member of the Immigration and Refugee Board makes a finding that a refugee claimant violated a section of the Criminal Code. The decision is:
        - [ ] Within their jurisdiction and not reviewable on judicial review
        - [x] Not within their jurisdiction and potentially reviewable by the Federal Court
        - [ ] An issue of procedural fairness
        - [ ] B and C
        <br>**Administrative decision-makers should not make findings on matters outside their jurisdiction. Criminal Code offences are tried by courts.**

    12. Which of the following is a type of delegated legislation?
        - [ ] Statutes passed by provincial legislatures
        - [ ] Bills passed by the Senate
        - [ ] Policies developed by ministries
        - [x] Regulations made under statutes
        <br>**As noted in Nastasi et al., Chapter 2 “Foundations of Administrative Law”, p. 64, there are two types of delegated legislation: ==regulations== made under statutes, usually by Cabinet or a Cabinet minister, and ==by-laws== passed by municipalities.**

    13. Which of the following is not required when an adjudicator seeks advice from another tribunal member?
        - [ ] The adjudicator makes the final decision
        - [ ] The consultation is voluntary on the adjudicator’s part
        - [x] The parties to the decision grant the adjudicator permission
        - [ ] No new issues or facts are introduced without the parties being notified and permitted to comment
        <br>**As noted in Nastasi et al., Chapter 2 “Foundations of Administrative Law”, p. 34, A, B, and D are required along with the stipulation that no one who is consulted puts pressure on the adjudicator to make a particular decision.**

    14. *Roncarelli v Duplessis*, the seminal case on rule of law, addresses issues of administrative overreach. If the case were to occur now, another possible argument(s) for Mr. Roncarelli would be:
        - [ ] There was a breach of his rights under the *Charter of Rights and Freedoms*.
        - [ ] A liquor license is a right.
        - [ ] This was a breach of procedural fairness.
        - [x] A and C
        <br>**The decision to revoke his liquor license breached his right to procedural fairness – the decision was made without notice and with no opportunity to respond. The decision targeted Mr. Roncarelli because he posted bail for members of his religious community and might, accordingly, violate his rights under the *Charter*.**

    15. Which of the following is not a limit on a decision-maker’s right to choose among options?
        - [ ] Discretion must be exercised in good faith.
        - [ ] The decision-maker must only consider relevant factors.
        - [ ] Similar cases should be treated in a similar way.
        - [x] Discretion must always be exercised in accordance with binding rules.
        <br>**The four limits on a decision-maker’s right to choose among options are set out in Nastasi et al., Chapter 2 “Foundations of Administrative Law” at ==pp. 31-32==.**

    16. What are two functions of the rule of law in society?
        - [ ] To ensure criminals are punished for their crimes
        - [x] To ensure society operates according to a set of rules enshrined in supreme law
        - [x] To ensure that laws apply to everyone equally, including those in positions of power
        - [ ] To ensure that the Charter of Rights and Freedoms is followed by every citizen
        <br>**With a clear system of rules, everyone knows what is expected of them, how they will be treated and what to expect from others. The rule of law ensures that there will be a legal response to any arbitrary or unjust actions. The rule of law also means that everyone is subject to the law. No one, no matter how important, how rich, how educated, or how powerful, is above the law. Laws apply to everyone equally, including those in positions of power.**

    17. True or false: You are a legal representative who unsuccessfully represented your client at an administrative hearing. When you receive the decision, you are concerned that the adjudicator was biased. You would like to recommend that your client apply to the courts to review the decision, but the enabling statute of the administrative tribunal does not provide a right of appeal and contains a provision prohibiting the courts from reviewing the administrative tribunal’s decisions. It is therefore not possible to have the courts review the tribunal’s decision.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**Despite the enabling legislation not having a right of appeal and containing a provision prohibiting the courts from reviewing the decision, judicial review would still be available. Because the right to judicial review is constitutional in nature, it cannot be taken away by any provision of a statute purporting to deny the right. It is therefore available even where a statute expressly prohibits a court from reviewing an administrative body’s decisions. See, Nastasi et al., Chapter 2 “Foundations of Administrative Law” , p. 53-54.**

    18. The scope of the authority or powers conferred on a government body or official by legislation or by common law is called:
        - [ ] Implied power
        - [ ] Discretion
        - [x] Jurisdiction
        - [ ] Sub-delegation
        <br>**See Nastasi et al., Chapter 2 “Foundations of Administrative Law”, pp. 29-30.**

    19. True or false: Certain decision makers may be subject to more rigorous procedural safeguards than others.
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False
        <br>**All types of administrative bodies and many types of decisions may be subject to a duty to act fairly. Nevertheless, certain agencies may be subject to more rigorous procedural safeguards than others. Specifically, tribunals must follow formal procedures similar to those followed by the courts. Additionally, the obligation of impartiality applies more strictly to tribunals than it does to other government decision-makers. See, Nastasi et al., Chapter 2 “Foundations of Administrative Law”, pp. 39-40.**

??? note "3.2 Fairness and the Right to be Heard"

    1. Which of the following statements is true?
        - [ ] In H&C applications, the onus rests on the officer to ensure that they have all the necessary information and documents from the applicant; otherwise, a request for additional information should be made before making a final decision.
        - [ ] Applicants are commonly recommended to make a refugee claim and submit an H&C application simultaneously to increase their chances of getting approved.
        - [ ] To apply for permanent residence under the H&C class outside Canada, the applicant must submit the Application for Permanent Residence from Outside Canada—Humanitarian and Compassionate Considerations form (IMM 5001) and the Supplementary Information form (IMM 5283).
        - [x] Failed refugee claimants are barred for 12 months from applying for H&C considerations unless they have a child under 18 who would be adversely affected by the decision.
        <br>**Under section 25(1.2) of the IRPA, failed refugee claimants are barred for 12 months from applying for H&C considerations following the latest of the following: a negative decision by the RPD, the RAD, the Federal Court, or a final decision that the claimant withdrew or abandoned their claim. As noted in Desloges & Sawicki, c. 9, p. 399, ==this bar does not apply to refugee claimants who have children under 18 who would be adversely affected by the claimant’s removal==.**

    2. True or false: The codification of the principle of “best interests of a child” into the IRPA means that the interests of the child outweigh all other factors in an H & C application. Factors affecting children should be given paramount consideration by decision-makers when making an H&C decision that directly affects a child.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**The codification of the principle of “best interests of a child” into the IRPA does not mean that the interests of the child outweigh all other factors in a case. While factors affecting children should be given substantial weight, the ==best interests of a child== is only one of many important factors that the decision-maker needs to consider when making an H&C decision that directly affects a child. See: Government of Canada, Operational Instructions: "Humanitarian and compassionate considerations: Assessment and processing”: "Best Interests of the Child."**

    3. Which of the following refers to the H&C exemptions?
        - [x] Section 25 of the IRPA
        - [ ] Section 25 of the IRPR
        - [ ] IRCC Inland Processing Manual number 2
        - [ ] Part 4 of the IRPA

    4. True or false: As set out in Operational Instructions, applicants may base their requests for H&C consideration on a specified list of factors only.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**Applicants may base their requests for H&C consideration on ==“any relevant factors”==, including but not limited to: establishment in Canada for in-Canada applicants; ties to Canada; the best interests of any children directly affected by the H&C decision; factors in their country of origin including adverse country conditions; health considerations including inability of a country to provide medical treatment; family violence considerations; consequences of the separation of relatives; inability to leave Canada has led to establishment (in the case of applicants in Canada); ability to establish in Canada for overseas applications; any unique or exceptional circumstances that might merit relief. See: Government of Canada, Operational Instructions: "Humanitarian and compassionate considerations: Assessment and processing”: "Hardship and the H&C Assessment".**

    5. True or false: Once an application for permanent residence on H & C grounds is submitted to IRCC for an applicant in Canada, it is not permitted to provide updates to the file.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**As noted by lawyer Will Tao in “The Alternative Remedy: Humanitarian and Compassionate Grounds Applications”, Migrant Conversations, at min. 22:47 – 23:20 (in onQ), ==file updates are very important==. It is not uncommon for applicants to wait two or even two and a half years for a decision. During that time updates which address positive changes to your client’s situation can be very helpful: for example, evidence of greater establishment in Canada or worsening conditions in their country of origin. It is up to the client or their representative to provide file updates. IRCC will not ask for additional information. See, Desloges & Sawicki, c. 9, p. 398.**

    6. Which of the following is not a component of the right to be heard?
        - [ ] The right to notice
        - [ ] The right to representation
        - [x] The right to select tribunal members
        - [ ] The right to be present
        <br>**See, Nastasi, Chapter 4, “Fairness: The Right to Be Heard”, pp 86-100.**

    7. The Baker factors:
        - [ ] include the legitimate expectations of the administrative decision-maker.
        - [ ] require non-citizens seeking to remain in Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds to be provided with a full oral hearing.
        - [ ] do not take into account the procedural choices made by administrative decision-makers.
        - [x] None of the above

        **Procedural fairness is “contextual,” not absolute. The Supreme Court set out five factors to assist in the determination of the appropriate level of fairness and the specific procedures that must by followed by the a tribunal or other decision-maker.** These include:

          - the nature of the decision;
          - the nature of the statutory scheme;
          - the importance of the decision to the affected person;
          - the extent to which the person affected has legitimate expectations of a particular process;
          - and the extent to which the legislature intended the decision-maker to have discretion to choose its own procedures.

        **See Nastasi et al., Chapter 4, “Fairness: The Right to Be Heard” p. 85.**

    8. True or false: Parties have a right to be represented at a tribunal, and the right includes an absolute right to an adjournment where necessary to obtain legal representation.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**In circumstances where a party received adequate notice of the hearing and time to retain a legal representative, an adjournment may very well be denied on the basis that it will cause delay and increased costs. A party is only entitled to a ==reasonable== opportunity to find representation. See Nastasi, Chapter 4, “Fairness: The Right to Be Heard”, p. 93.**

    9. In Derek McKee’s “Guidelines (‘Soft Law’)” video lecture, which of the following does he say about guidelines?
        - [ ] They promote consistency in statutory interpretation
        - [ ] They can be functionally similar to regulations
        - [ ] They can be an alternate to open-ended discretion to promote consistency
        - [x] All of the above

    10. What must adequate notice of a hearing provide to the affected parties?
        - [ ] An explanation of what the hearing is about that is sufficient to allow them to prepare to address the issue
        - [ ] Sufficient time to prepare
        - [x] An **explanation** of what the hearing is about that is sufficient to allow them to prepare to address the issues and sufficient **time** to prepare
        - [ ] Sufficient time to prepare and disclosure of evidence
        <br>**See Nastasi, Chapter 4, “Fairness: The Right to Be Heard” pp. 88-89.**

    11. Lydia applied for permanent residence on H&C grounds from inside Canada. After waiting for several years, she just learnt that her application was refused. What legal recourse does Lydia have available to her if she wishes to challenge the officer’s decision?
        - [ ] Lydia can appeal the officer’s decision to the Immigration Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board as long as she has new evidence that arose after the officer’s refusal.
        - [ ] Lydia can appeal the officer’s decision to the Immigration Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board.
        - [x] Lydia can file an application for leave for judicial review with the Federal Court within 15 days of the date of refusal.
        - [ ] Lydia can file an application for leave for judicial review with the Federal Court within 60 days of the date of refusal.
        <br>**As noted in Desloges & Sawicki, c. 9 at p. 405, there is ==no appeal from a refused permanent residence application on H & C grounds==. An Application for leave and for judicial review may be filed with the Federal Court within 15 days of the date of refusal in the case of decision on an application from inside Canada, or 60 days in the case of a decision for an application from outside Canada.**

    12. Which of the following has the authority to approve an application for permanent residence under the Humanitarian & Compassionate (H&C) class?
        - [ ] Minister of Public Safety through a CBSA officer
        - [ ] Minister of Public Safety through a port of entry officer
        - [x] Minister of IRCC or a delegated IRCC officer
        - [ ] Citizenship Judge
        <br>**C. See, Desloges & Sawicki, c. 9, p. 390.**

    13. Which of the following corroborating evidence should not be included in with the Supplementary Information Form submitted for in-Canada H & C applications?
        - [ ] reference letters from employers, schools, and volunteer organizations
        - [ ] a statutory declaration from the applicant swearing to the truth of their story
        - [ ] an opinion letter about the negative mental or physical effects on any children affected by the decision
        - [x] an expert affidavit attesting to the applicant’s well founded fear of persecution in their country of origin
        <br>**As noted in Government of Canada, Operational Instructions: "Humanitarian and compassionate considerations: Assessment and processing”: "Hardship and the H&C Assessment", “Subsection 25(1.3) of the IRPA states the following: ‘... the Minister may not consider the factors that are taken into account in the determination of whether a person is a Convention refugee under section 96 or a person in need of protection under subsection 97(1) but must consider elements related to the hardships that affect the foreign national’. In other words, ==officers do not determine whether a well-founded fear of persecution, risk to life, danger of torture and risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment has been established, but they may take the underlying facts into account in determining whether the applicant will face hardship if returned to their country of origin==.”**

    14. Claudio is a foreign national who is seeking permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate grounds.  He has called your office to ask questions about making an H&C application.  Claudio went onto the IRCC website and found many different types of immigrations forms, but could not find an application form for foreign nationals making an H&C request from outside of Canada.  Which of the following advice should you give to Claudio?
        - [ ] Claudio could not find the required forms online because as a foreign national, he can only apply under the H&C class from within Canada.
        - [ ] He does not require an application form under the public policy exemptions.
        - [x] There are no specific H&C forms available for those applying outside Canada.  Applicants should include the written request for consideration on H&C grounds along with the PR visa.
        - [ ] H&C applications are very concise applications consisting primarily of the Supplementary Information form (IMM 5283).
        <br>**See, Desloges & Sawicki, Chapter 9, s. IV.  In general, H&C applications made from outside of Canada do not require specific forms.  A written request for H&C considerations should be included along with the application for a PR visa.**

    15. True or false: It is not uncommon for draft decisions at a tribunal to go through a peer quality assurance review or for tribunal members to consult each other while drafting their decisions. There are no limits placed on these practices.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**Unless the consultation is required by statute, it must be voluntary; the tribunal chair and other members must not put any pressure on the adjudicator; the consultation should be limited to questions of law and policy. The adjudicator must be free to disregard the advice coming from the consultation. See Nastasi, Chapter 4, “Fairness: The Right to Be Heard” pp. 95-98.**

    16. True or false: You represent a client at the Immigration Refugee Board. You receive a Notice of Decision a few weeks after the hearing. The document consists of a prescribed form with checkboxes and no other explanation. There are two boxes: “accepted” and “rejected”. The “rejected” box is marked with an “X”. The reasons for decision violate the requirements of procedural fairness.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**In Liang v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), (1999) FCJ No 1301 (TD), a court accepted checking a box on a prescribed form as sufficient to fulfill the requirement to provide reasons. Where reasons are given, but are inadequate, this is not a breach of procedural fairness. In other words, deficiencies or flaws in the reasons given do not fall under the category of a breach of the duty of procedural fairness. See Nastasi, Chapter 4, “Fairness: The Right to Be Heard” pp. 99-100.**

    17. What is the purpose of cross-examination?
        - [x] To give parties the chance to challenge the evidence given by the other side’s witnesses
        - [ ] To test the character of the witnesses
        - [ ] To present the facts of the case
        - [ ] None of the above
        <br>**See, Nastasi, Chapter 4, “Fairness: The Right to Be Heard” p. 96.**

    18. In Craig Forcese’s video lecture, “Procedural Content: The Right to be Heard Pt 1”, he expresses a fear about the guidance provided by the Supreme Court in *Baker v Canada* in relation to how much procedural entitlement a recipient is owed. What is it?
        - [ ] That decision-makers will stop following the relevant jurisprudence
        - [ ] That the case dilutes audi alteram partem and risks breaching the fundamental principles of procedural fairness
        - [x] That case reinforces the impression of objectivity and masks the degree of subjectivity
        - [ ] None of the above
        <br>**See, “Procedural Content: The Right to be Heard Pt 1”, at min. 14:02 – 14:17.**

    19. What is the result if a statute or regulation sets out a more specific fairness requirement than the common law in a particular situation?
        - [x] The statutory requirement takes precedence.
        - [ ] The statutory requirement will take precedence only if it is more onerous.
        - [ ] The common law requirement always takes precedence.
        - [ ] The common law requirement will take precedence only if it is more onerous.
        <br>**See Nastasi, Chapter 4, “Fairness: The Right to Be Heard”, p. 85.**

??? note "3.3 Fairness and the Right to an Impartial Decision-Maker"

    1. Which one of the following constitutes an example of impartiality?
        - [ ] An agency lawyer who is responsible for assigning and approving proceedings against a person privately advises the tribunal as to how it should decide the case
        - [ ] An agency lawyer who is arguing before the tribunal privately advises the tribunal as to how it should decide the case
        - [ ] An official recommends action against an individual and then serves as a member of the panel that will decide whether to take the action
        - [x] There is an investigator who investigates and recommends administrative action, a Minister’s representative who argues the case before the tribunal, and adjudicator who make the decision
        <br>**A clear ==separation of roles== among those who investigate and recommend administrative action, those who argue the case before the tribunal, and those who make the decision, as described in “D”, is an example of institutional impartiality. In contrast, a multifunctional structure creates an appearance of bias when those who are responsible for recommending or prosecuting proceedings against a person are also involved in deciding whether to take away the person’s rights. See, Nastasi, c. 5 at p. 112.**

    2. The requirement of independence takes an internal perspective, focusing on the state of mind of the administrative decision-maker.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**like individual bias, the emphasis is on the appearance of bias to a reasonable person.**

    3. Why does Will Tao suggest that judges prefer not to engage with a reasonable apprehension of bias argument?
        - [ ] Because it is too complicated
        - [ ] Because they don’t understand the area well
        - [x] Because they don’t want to allude to systemic problems
        - [ ] A and B
        <br>**Per Tao in "*Reasonable Apprehension of Bias in Immigration/Refugee Related Decision-Making: High Thresholds and Reticent Engagement*”: “My feeling is the ‘reasonable apprehension of bias’ not only is viewed as a case-specific procedural fairness issue but one that undermines the rule of law. As such, ==judges prefer not to give off the impression that there are potential systematic problems==”.**

    4. Why, in *Kozak v Canada*, did the Federal Court of Appeal find that the IRB's lead case strategy was institutionally biased?
        - [ ] The "lead case" idea was inherently biased
        - [ ] The evidence established that the IRB members involved in preparing the lead case were racist
        - [x] The cumulative effect of the facts of the case pointed to bias
        - [ ] The facts disclosed a clear breach of Charter rights
        <br>***Kozak v Canada*, at para 60: "Nonetheless, despite the absence of a 'smoking gun', I have concluded on the basis of the ==entire factual matrix== of this case that a reasonable person who had considered every aspect of the matter and had thought it through carefully, would think that the hearing panel was biased and was not acting independently when it rejected the appellants' claims for refugee status."**

    5. What is generally the appropriate remedy when a reasonable apprehension of bias is substantiated on judicial review?
        - [ ] The decision is invalidated, if it is likely that the substance of the decision was impacted
        - [ ] The decision is invalidated, if it is certain that the substance of the decision was impacted
        - [ ] The decision is invalidated, unless the efficiency of the administrative decision-maker would be unduly impacted
        - [x] The decision is invalidated
        <br>**If there was a RAB, the decision cannot stand. It is therefore invalidated and sent back for re-determination – it must be heard again.**

    6. The most important consideration/s in determining whether there is institutional bias are:
        - [ ] the closeness of the relationship between an agency and a government department that is affected by its decisions;
        - [ ] whether or not the agency has exclusive control to develop and implement its annual budget
        - [ ] where an agency has multiple functions, the extent to which these functions overlap in a manner that suggests that some employees have inappropriate influence over others.
        - [x] A and C
        <br>**As noted in Nastasi, c. 5 at p. 110: the most important consideration/s in determining whether there is institutional bias are: the ==closeness== of the relationship between an agency and a government department that is affected by its decisions; where an agency has multiple functions, the extent to which these functions ==overlap== in a manner that suggests that some employees have inappropriate influence over others.**

    7. You are representing Leo in a removal order appeal hearing at the IRB. Near the end of the hearing, you become aware that 10 years earlier, the presiding member, Luis Gonzalez, attended a meeting where the case before the tribunal was briefly discussed. At that time he was a junior lawyer with the Immigration Division of the Department of Justice. You raise the matter but Mr. Gonzlez explains he has no recollection of this meeting or the case from that time. The hearing is almost finished. He advises that he does not feel it is in the best interest of your client or the Minister to step aside.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**As noted in Nastasi, c. 5 at p. 114, if the adjudicator feels that they have no actual bias and any appearance of bias will not constitute a “reasonable apprehension” of bias, they may decide it is in the public interest for them to continue. While there is some dispute as to whether ==an adjudicator can present facts in his or her own defence==, in the case of *Weywaykum* the Supreme Court of Canada permitted Justice Binnie to file a statement saying he had no recollection of involvement in a case he had played a minor role in some 15 years earlier.**

    8. The Supreme Court of Canada has endorsed the idea that administrative tribunals are constitutionally required to be fully independent from the government in the same manner as the judiciary.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**The Supreme Court of Canada ==rejected== the idea that administrative tribunals are constitutionally required to be independent in the case *Ocean Port Hotel Ltd. v. British Columbia (General Manager, Liquor Control and Licensing Branch)*. The Court held that there is a fundamental distinction between tribunals and courts. Tribunals are created precisely for the purpose of implementing government policy. Nevertheless, tribunals, in contrast to department officials, may enjoy some of the hallmarks of administrative independence, subject to their enabling statute. ==As noted in Module 3.2 (in onQ), a higher level of independence is required where a decision affects a party’s Charter rights.==**

    9. You are representing Raj at an admissibility hearing at the IRB. The Minister is alleging that there are reasonable grounds to believe Raj poses a threat to national security. During a recess, Raj returns from the washroom distraught. Raj overheard the presiding Member speaking on the phone in the hallway. The Member said “I knew from the moment I saw that no good gangster in my hearing room today was pure trouble.” What is your very next step?
        - [ ] Refer the client to a lawyer to initiate an application for leave and judicial review on grounds of bias
        - [ ] Defer consideration of the bias question until after the hearing concludes
        - [x] Bring a motion for the presiding member to step down and ask for a ruling by the member
        - [ ] None of the above
        <br>**Certain kinds of behaviour toward the parties during a hearing and even outside the hearing room may suggest that a decision maker does not have an open mind. An adjudicator expressing opinions about the issues in the case before all the evidence and arguments have been heard could lead a reasonable and well-informed person to assume that the decision-maker is biased. The hurdle to overcome with these facts is that it seems Raj was the only person who overheard the Member’s statement. Nevertheless, the courts usually consider a party that does not raise an allegation of bias during the hearing to have waived the right to argue it in court. So it is important to ==raise the issue== of an appearance of bias as early as possible. See Nastasi, c. 5, at p. 113.**

    10. According to Alyssa Clutterbuck, what is **intersectionality**?
        - [ ] A way of thinking about stereotypes
        - [x] A theory that illuminates multiple and simultaneous sites of oppression and accounts for Baker’s multidimensional experience of disability and race
        - [ ] A theory that helps understand why children’s interests should be a primary consideration in H & C decision-making
        - [ ] A and B
        <br>**Per Clutterbuck at 57: Disabled women of colour’s experiences of discrimination pose unique challenges to law. The multidimensionality of their subordination is best understood through the lens of intersectionality, a theory introduced by Kimberlé Crenshaw that ==illuminates the multiple and simultaneous sites of subordination and the limits of feminist, antiracist, and other critical discourses==. The theory has provided grounds for scholarly writing on women of colour, queer and trans people of colour, and groups with multiple and simultaneous experiences of oppression and structural marginalization.”**

    11. You are waiting for the elevator with your client, a refugee claimant, on the main floor of the building of the IRB to return to the hearing room after the lunch break. When the doors open, you see the presiding Member from the hearing chatting and appearing very familiar with the Minister's counsel from your client's hearing. As soon as they see you, their conversation stops. Meanwhile, you do a quick Google search on each of their names and learn that prior to their respective appointments, they were both associates of the same law firm. What should you do?
        - [x] Raise reasonable apprehension of bias immediately
        - [ ] Apply for internal review, then raise reasonable apprehension of bias
        - [ ] Refer them to a lawyer, who will sue the Member
        - [ ] None of the above
        <br>**Alleging that a tribunal member is or appears to be biased is a serious matter, and bias allegations should not be made lightly. Aside from any other reasons to exercise caution, the first rule of good advocacy is to not alienate the decision maker. Moreover, the courts have made it clear that restraint must be exercised when making such allegations. However, in this instance, a reviewing court would likely view the decision maker's close association with the Minister's counsel, a person whose interests may be affected by the outcome of the case, as rising to the level of disqualifying bias. Where it is necessary to initiate a motion on apprehension of bias, as is the case here, it is important to do so ==as soon as== the question of bias or conflict of interest arises. The courts generally consider that a party who fails to raise an allegation of bias during a hearing to have waived the right to argue it subsequently in court.**

    12. Why does Clutterbuck say that Baker’s appeal was not as much of a success as it initially appeared?
        - [ ] Because Mavis Baker was deported
        - [ ] Because the Officer who made the decision in her case was not disciplined
        - [ ] Because the Supreme Court failed to grant her residence application
        - [x] Because the Supreme Court failed to grapple with the issue Mavis Baker’s intersecting vulnerabilities
        <br>**See, Clutterbuck, at p 63: “I argue that Baker is an apt illustration of the ==inability of courts== to recognize ==how people with intersecting vulnerabilities are targeted and attacked by administrative systems==. I apply Spade’s notion of administrative violence to understand the violence committed against Ms. Baker by Canada’s immigration system and the epistemic violence of legal approaches that privilege procedural questions and ignore the centrality of race, gender, and disability as justiciable issues.” See also page 66: “The facts in Baker provided an opportune moment for the SCC to conceptualize racism, sexism, classism, and ableism as a feature in attitudes among certain personnel in Canada’s immigration system. However, the Court did not engage these central aspects of the case, sweeping their possible justiciability under the proverbial rug.”**

    13. If the presiding member in a matter before the IRB rules against your motion for their recusal on the basis of bias, you should immediately refer the client to a lawyer to seek judicial review of the member’s decision to continue.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**If the member does not agree that their participation will result in reasonable apprehension of bias, it is ==not necessary to immediately seek judicial review== of the member’s decision to continue. A party’s continued participation in the hearing will not be considered a waiver of the right to raise the issue in later court proceedings, since the issue was raised during the hearing. See Nastasi, c. 5 at p. 113.**

    14. Your client Marcel has been having a tough time recently, and you notice that they are very nervous about their IRB hearing. During the hearing, the presiding member adopts a somewhat aggressive tone with some of the questions posed to your client. You agree that the Member’s tone has been a bit rude, but your client is really upset. These facts suggest that Marcel has a strong basis for asking the member to stand aside on the basis of reasonable apprehension of bias.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**==the threshold for bias is high==. Bias must be obvious to the reasonable person and must be grounded in evidence. Remarks that are rude will likely not meet this high threshold – see de Grandpré’s dissent in *Committee for Justice and Liberty v National Energy Board* at para. 395. At the same time, if Marcel’s growing anxiety is negatively impacting his ability to provide testimony, a brief mid-hearing “conference” can be requested with the Board member to draw the Member’s attention to Marcel’s condition and request appropriate accommodations. Section 10.1 of Chairperson Guideline 8: Procedures with respect to vulnerable persons appearing before the IRB (which you will learn about in the Refugee Protection course) confirms: “The IRB ensures that all those who appear at its hearings or other proceedings are questioned with sensitivity and respect. This obligation is all the more important in the case of vulnerable persons. In probing the information provided by the person, the IRB will attempt to ==avoid traumatizing== or re-traumatizing the vulnerable person.”**

    15. You are appearing before at the Immigration and Refugee Board. At the beginning of your client's hearing, the presiding member exchanges pleasant greetings with the Minister's representative. You overhear them chatting about the weather and they seem friendly. What should you do?
        - [ ] Warn the Minister's representative of a possible conflict of interest
        - [ ] Make notes about the incident to raise an allegation of reasonable apprehension of bias arguments in case you have to appeal the decision
        - [x] Nothing – it is okay to be friendly in this professional setting
        - [ ] Immediately request that the Member recuse himself from the proceedings due to personal relationship
        <br>**While a close relationship with a person whose interests may be affected by the outcome of the case may give rise to an appearance of bias, ==friendly banter== in the hearing room likely does ==not== cross the line so long as the decision-maker is not intervening in the hearing process in a way that persistently favours one party over another. A reviewing court is not likely to consider the presiding Member's conduct in this scenario as rising to the level of reasonable apprehension of bias.**

    16. Your client has been detained for 6 months now. They have a detention review hearing at the IRB. Your client receives an unfavourable decision – they will remain in detention. One week later, you receive an anonymous letter advising that before the decision was released, it was reviewed and changed by the Chairperson. The decision had initially directed that your client should be released. The facts as presented constitute an impermissible incursion on adjudicative autonomy.
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False
        <br>**Tribunal members can seek advice from agency staff and colleagues. However, they must make the final decision ==voluntarily== (see, Module 3.3 in onQ: “Consultation and Advice”). The Chairperson’s intervention likely constituted institutional bias. See also, Nastasi, c. 5, p. 112; and c. 4, pp. 94-98.**

    17. Tribunals are not expected to have the same degree of independence as courts.
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False
        <br>**unless their enabling statutes stipulate otherwise, tribunals are not fully independent from government. They are part of the executive branch and are appointed by it.**

    18. Why does Will Tao suggest that counsel should not be afraid to raise reasonable apprehension of bias?
        - [ ] Because it is easy to establish on judicial review
        - [ ] Because arguments about reasonable apprehension of bias often succeed
        - [x] Because the system can be inherently biased and it is good to point it out
        <br>**Per Tao: “Counsel should not also be dissuaded by the high-bar or the fear of being criticized, for putting together well-thought out criticisms of the structure of immigration-decision making that i[s] inherently biased. I do see a room for the argument – even if we never have another Baker-like decision that spells out the bias so clearly and unequivocally.”**

??? note "3.4 Judicial Review"

    1. Your former client Roberto contacts you with good news. On judicial review, the Federal Court just quashed the decision that denied him refugee status. Roberto no longer needs your help, because his refugee status is now granted.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**While there are exceptions ==(including in the Vavilov case itself)==, courts more commonly send the matter back for redetermination. The court’s judgement should be reviewed to identify whether the matter was directed back to the IRB for redetermination. See Module 3.4 in onQ.**

    2. You are an RCIC representing Salem who has been detained by CBSA for almost a year. Salem has been denied release in every preceding detention review hearing before the Immigration Division of the IRB. He is desperate to be released. You are aware that decisions of the Immigration Division could be judicially reviewed in Federal Court. A habeas corpus application may offer another avenue for challenging the legality of Salem’s continuing detention. What should you do?
        - [x] Advise Salem that he should consider retaining a lawyer – you are not qualified to represent him before the courts
        - [ ] Help Salem apply for *habeas corpus*
        - [ ] Help Salem apply for judicial review
        - [ ] B and C
        <br>**Regulated immigration consultants are not authorized to represent clients before the courts, so Salem should be referred to a lawyer to discuss his options.**

    3. Which one of the following circumstances is **NOT** an exception to reasonableness as the default standard of review on judicial review:
        - [ ] when there are constitutional questions
        - [x] when there are serious issues of credibility
        - [ ] when their general questions of law of central importance to the legal system as a whole
        - [ ] questions regarding the jurisdictional boundaries between two or more administrative bodies

        **In *Vavilov*, the Supreme Court clarified that the presumption of reasonableness review (for judicial review as opposed to statutory appeals), may be rebutted:**

        - where the **legislature** has indicated that a different standard should apply; or
        - where the rule of law requires review on a **correctness** standard.

        **The Supreme Court further confirmed that this will be the case for questions that fall within one of three categories:**

        - **constitutional questions**, including the constitutional division of powers, whether provisions of a decision-maker’s enabling statute infringe the Charter;
        - and general questions of law of central **importance to the legal system** as a whole, which require uniform and consistent answers as a result of their impact on the administration of justice as a whole.

        The assessment of credibility does not fall within one of these categorical exceptions.

    4. There has been significant disagreement within the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) concerning the degree of risk faced by an ethnic minority in country X. About a third of the decisions dealing with appeals from country X in the past six months have been based on clear findings about the deteriorating human rights situation in the country, while the balance have found that state protection for the minority population remains adequate. You represented Ana in her appeal before the RAD. Ana fears return to country X. Her appeal is rejected and she has retained new counsel to pursue a judicial review application. **The existence of internal disagreement within the RAD will rebut the presumption of reasonableness in Ana’s case.**
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**As noted by Deanna Okun-Nachoff (in conversation with Steven Meurrens) in “Borderlines Podcast Episode 35 – The Implications of the Supreme Court of Canada Decision in Vavilov”, the Supreme Court clarified in Vavilov that ==persistent discord within an administrative agency does not change the degree of deference of afforded to the agency’s decision== @ mins 21:00 – 24:12.**

    5. Anna’s application for refugee status in Canada was denied and her appeal to the Refugee Appeal Division was rejected as well. She has exhausted internal appeals within the IRB and has retained counsel to initiate leave and judicial review in Federal Court. Her lawyer has reviewed the Member’s reasons for decision and the full contents of Anna’s case file at the IRB and believes that their decision was legally incorrect and based on a misinterpretation of key evidence. Which of the following should be the lawyer’s argument in relation to standard of review?
        - [ ] Argue for review on a correctness standard, because then the Court can find the decision was wrong and substitute their own decision
        - [ ] No need to address standard of review at all
        - [x] Concede that the applicable standard of review is reasonableness and focus the argument on why the decision was unreasonable
        - [ ] Argue for review on a correctness standard because of the error of law and focus the argument on why the decision at issue was incorrect
        <br>**A legal error is reviewable on a standard of reasonableness. Anna’s lawyer should focus on the decision actually made and the justification offered for it in order to construct an argument that the decision was unreasonable per *Vavilov*.**

    6. The Supreme Court found the Immigration Officer’s decision in Mavis Baker’s case unreasonable because:
        - [ ] the reasons for decision failed to give sufficient weight or consideration to the **hardship** that a return to Jamaica might cause Ms. Baker
        - [ ] the decision was contrary to the **guidelines** issued by the Minister
        - [ ] the failure to give serious weight and consideration to the **interests of the children**
        - [x] all of the above
        <br>**See, Baker, paras. 63-74.**

    7. The prerogative writ that is used to prevent an administrative decision-maker from doing something that it is not permitted to do, before it does so, is *certiorari*.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**The prerogative writ that is used to prevent an administrative decision-maker from doing something that it is not permitted to do is *prohibition***.

    8. When the first instance decision contains a factual error, it is not a guarantee of a successful outcome on judicial review.
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False
        <br>**Section 18.1(4)(d) of the Federal Courts Act requires that the decision-maker must have “based its decision or order on an erroneous finding of fact that is made in a perverse or capricious manner or without regard for the material before it’. As noted in Module 3.4 in onQ, ==the bar is very high for overturning factual errors==. Examples included where the decision maker based their decision on a finding fact for which there was no evidence or contrary evidence; or the decision maker ignored evidence directly contrary to the decision reached.**

    9. *Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Vavilov* concerned:
        - [ ] the review of a decision by the Immigration Division of the IRB finding that Mr. Vavilov was inadmissible to Canada as the dependents of foreign nationals who had engaged in espionage against Canada’s interests
        - [ ] the review of a decision by the Immigration Appeal Division of the IRB that removal order against Mr. Vavilov should be upheld
        - [x] the review of a decision by the Registrar of Citizenship to cancel Mr. Vavilov’s Canadian citizenship
        - [ ] the review of a decision by a Minister’s delegate to issue a Canadian passport to Mr. Vavilov and his brother
        <br>**As noted in Module 3.4 in onQ, Vavilov involved the review of the decision of the Registrar of citizenship to cancel Vavilov’s Canadian citizenship. The Registrar held that he was not a Canadian citizen because, although he was born in Canada and would for this reason normally be entitled to citizenship under s. 3(1)(a) of the Citizenship Act, his parents, who had operated in Canada as Russian spies, were at that time “employee[s] of a foreign government” within the meaning of s. 3(2)(a) of the Act. Mr. Vavilov sought judicial review of the Registrar’s interpretation of this provision.**

    10. What are the benefits of the Vavilov decision?
        - [ ] It provides a simpler approach to determining the applicable standard of review for judicial review
        - [ ] It has clearly defined the scope of deference afforded to first instance decision makers
        - [ ] It confirmed that Alexander Vavilov is a Canadian citizen
        - [x] All of the above
        <br>**See Vavilov; and Deanna Okun-Nachoff (in conversation with Steven Meurrens) in “Borderlines Podcast Episode 35 – The Implications of the Supreme Court of Canada Decision in Vavilov.”**

    11. In *Vavilov*, the Supreme Court found that the Registrar’s decision should be reviewed on a standard of reasonableness. Why did the Court find the decision unreasonable?
        - [ ] The Registrar did not justify why she thought Va*v*ilov’s parents fell within section 3(2)(a) of the Citizenship Act
        - [ ] Because section 3(2)(a) was not intended to apply to children of foreign government representatives
        - [ ] Because the Registrar failed to address *Vavilov*’s submission without justifying why
        - [x] All of the above
        <br>**See Vavilov, para 172.**

    12. An appeal lies as of right to the Federal Court of Appeal from a final judgment of the Federal Court on an immigration or citizenship judicial review.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**As noted in Module 3.4 in onQ, for those affected by decisions made under the IRPA or the Citizenship Act, an ==appeal from the judgment of the Federal Court== on an application for judicial review may be made ==only if==, when the judgment is rendered, the reviewing judge ==certifies that a serious question of general importance== is involved and states the question (see. IRPA,s.74(d); Citizenship Act, s. 22(d)).**

    13. If an “adequate alternative remedy” (like an internal appeal mechanism granted by statute) is available in a particular administrative context, it should, as a general rule, be exhausted first, before seeking judicial review.
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False
        <br>**As noted in Module 3.4, internal appellate remedies prescribed by the IRPA, must be exhausted first.**

    14. An immigration, refugee or citizenship decision may be challenged on judicial review either on the basis of procedural deficiencies in the administrative process or because of deficiencies in the analysis of the decision maker on the substance of the decision but not both.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**==The six grounds of judicial review== are set out in s. 18. 1(4) of the Federal Courts Act. It is open to applicants to challenge first instance decisions on any or all of these grounds.**

    15. **Correctness** is the standard of review that applies to determine whether an administrative decision-maker has complied with **procedural fairness**. If a decision maker violated the principles of procedural fairness, the decision is overturned.
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False
        <br>**as noted in Module 3.4 in onQ, this approach to the review of decisions on grounds of procedural fairness violations was confirmed by the Supreme Court, pre-Vavilov.**

    16. Match the items in the left hand column with the applicable provision or item in the right hand column:
        - Within 15 days of being notified of the decision in the case of a matter arising in Canada (IRPA s. 72(2)(b)): Deadline for notice of application for leave and for judicial review in an immigration matter arising within Canada
        - Within 60 days of being notified of the decision in the case of a matter arising outside Canada (IRPA s. 72(2)(b)): Deadline for notice of application for leave and for judicial review in an immigration matter arising outside Canada
        - Within 30 days of being notified of the decision (Citizenship Act, s 22 .1(2)(a)): Deadline for notice of application for leave and for judicial review in a citizenship matter
        - Full review on the merits: Appeal
        - Not a hearing *de novo*: Judicial Review
        - Remit the matter for redetermination by a different decision maker: The most common remedy on judicial review
        - Substituting the negative decision for a positive decision: An unusual remedy on judicial review
        - **Federal Courts Act, section 18.1(4)**: One or more of the **six grounds** of review may provide the basis for allowing an application for judicial review
        - Federal Court Rules, Rule 119: A person may represent themself or be represented by a solicitor

    17. The prerogative writ that is used to compel an administrative decision-maker to perform a duty that it is obliged to perform is mandamus.
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False
        <br>**See “Prerogative Writs” in Module 3.4 in onQ.**

    18. Robert Danay explains the concept of deference with real life examples in “What does standard of review mean?” (Borderlines podcast #35 with Steven Meurrens). What analogy does Mr. Danay use to describe reasonableness as a deferential standard of review?
        - [ ] A child who is given authority to decide every day what to eat for breakfast
        - [x] A child who is given authority to choose what their mother should wear every day for a week
        - [ ] A couple deciding which restaurant to visit for dinner
        - [ ] A spouse having the final say on which restaurant to visit for dinner
        <br>**Mr. Danay explains that the standard of review concerns how closely the courts will scrutinize a first instance decision. He uses the analogy of a child who is given authority to choose what their mother should wear every day for a week and the mother has to accept the child’s choice without question unless the choice is “bananas” (when the reasonableness issue is triggered) – an example, he neglects to select any clothing for her legs @ mins. 6:00 – 7:48.**

    19. Once a question is certified, the Federal Court of Appeal is restricted to considering the certified question and may not consider any other issues on appeal.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**Once a question is certified, the Federal Court of Appeal is ==not== restricted to considering the certified question but may consider all issues raised by the appeal (Baker, at para. 12)**

    20. Persistent discord or internal disagreement within an administrative agency changes the applicable standard of review or degree of deference a court will afford to the decision of that agency.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**As noted by Deanna Okun-Nachoff (in conversation with Steven Meurrens in “Borderlines Podcast Episode 35 – The Implications of the Supreme Court of Canada Decision in Vavilov”), the Supreme Court clarified in Vavilov that ==persistent discord within an administrative agency does not change the degree of deference of afforded to the agency’s decision== @ mins 21:00 – 24:12.**

    21. The Federal Court delivers most of its decisions orally, from the bench, just after the hearing concludes
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>As noted by Justice Norris, the majority of the Federal Court’s decisions are ==written==, not oral. See, Interview with Justice John Norris, Module 3.4, onQ

??? note "3.5 The Constitution and the Charter"

    1. In Canada v Taino, the Immigration Division considered whether the continuing detention of a permanent resident who could not be deported would violate his Charter rights. What rights were engaged?
        - [ ] Section 9 – because his unlawful detention was arbitrary
        - [ ] Section 15 – because his rights to equality were breached
        - [ ] Section 7 – because section 248 of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations breached his right to liberty
        - [x] Sections 7 and 9 because Mr. Taino's ongoing detention breached his **right to liberty** and was **arbitrary**.
        <br>**The Immigration Division ordered Mr. Taino's release on the basis that his ongoing detention violated both sections 7 and 9 of the Charter and was not saved by section 1. It is interesting to note, however, that on judicial review, the Federal Court determined that the matter should be decided by applying principles of administrative law and statutory interpretation. The scheme was ultimately upheld as Charter compliant. The detention was not long enough to engage section 9 of the Charter [*Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v Taino*, 2020 FC 427 (CanLII), <[https://canlii.ca/t/j611t](https://canlii.ca/t/j611t){:target="\_blank"}>].**

    2. Your client is a business class immigrant and owns a parcel of land within the city limits that was subject to an expropriation order. The Expropriations Tribunal upheld the expropriation to facilitate the construction of an extension to the city’s subway system. This Tribunal is exercising a statutory power under the provincial Expropriations Act. Your client did not receive notice of the hearing before the Tribunal. She learned that a hearing had been convened when she received a decision letter in the mail. The consequence of this decision is that your client’s plans to build a shopping mall on the property have been upended, resulting in significant financial losses. Your client intends to invoke a provision in the Expropriations Act to request that the Tribunal reconsider the matter. For the reconsideration hearing, the Tribunal can apply the following authorities to this matter:
        - [ ] Common law
        - [ ] Section 7 of the Charter
        - [ ] Relevant provisions of the Expropriations Act
        - [x] A and C
        <br>**The Charter will not be engaged, because your client’s rights to life, liberty, and security of the person are not at stake. Your client’s financial loss does not come within the ambit of s. 7.**

    3. What remedy is a tribunal not permitted to award under section 24(1) of the Charter?
        - [x] Declare a law unconstitutional
        - [ ] Overrule a decision-maker
        - [ ] Refuse to follow a procedure that is contrary to the Charter
        - [ ] Refuse to apply a law that contravenes the Charter
        <br>**Section ==52(1)== of the Constitution Act, 1982 is the source of authority for courts and many tribunals to declare a law or provision to be ==unconstitutional==. See, Nastasi, c. 3, p. 77. Note, as well, that it is only by obtaining a declaration of invalidity by a superior court that a litigant can establish the general invalidity of the legislation for all future cases.**

    4. Which of the following would **not** be bound by the Charter?
        - [ ] A private body carrying out a public policy
        - [ ] A community college with a board appointed by the provincial government
        - [ ] A court hearing a criminal trial
        - [x] A federally incorporated business
        <br>**The Charter applies to governments, government ministries/departments, agencies, boards, commissions, and maybe some bodies that have a public function and receive public funding, including hospitals. See Nastasi, c. 3 at pp. 60-61.**

    5. What examples does the Springtide Collective video, “The Charter of Rights and Freedoms” use to explain the concept of the Charter as a “living tree”?
        - [ ] Same-sex marriage
        - [ ] Legalization of marijuana
        - [ ] Internet privacy
        - [ ] Physician-assisted suicide
        - [x] A and C
        <br>**@ min. 4:16, the video begins a segment on the Charter as a “living tree”, emphasizing that the Charter changes every time a new ruling is made by the Supreme Court. The video proceeds to cite the examples of rulings on ==same sex marriage and internet privacy==.**

    6. In *Law Society of British Columbia v Mangat*, the Supreme Court of Canada found that immigration as a subject matter fell within provincial and federal jurisdiction. Why, then, did it assign responsibility for the matter to the federal government?
        - [ ] Because it is more efficient to only have one level of government legislating in the area
        - [ ] Because the Court trusts the federal government more
        - [ ] Because the paramountcy doctrine says the federal government’s historical involvement in relation to naturalization and aliens must be respected
        - [x] Because the **paramountcy doctrine** stipulates that the federal government prevails where there is conflict between federal and provincial legislation
        <br>**Section 95 of the Constitution Act, 1867 grants to both the federal and provincial legislatures the jurisdiction to legislate in relation to immigration. Where there is an operational conflict, the federal government’s jurisdiction will prevail. See, Aiken, Grey, c. 4.**

    7. In Singh v Minister of Employment and Immigration, which of the following was/were the Court’s reason/s in holding that the procedures for determining refugee status violated the applicant’s section 7 rights?
        - [ ] The Charter applies to every person present in Canada, regardless of their immigration status
        - [ ] The concept of “fundamental justice” in section 7 requires that a refugee claimant have an opportunity to state their case and know the case they have to meet; the procedures failed to provide that opportunity
        - [ ] The scheme violated procedural fairness because refused claimants were not provided access to a statutory appeal on the merits of a refused refugee claim
        - [x] A and B
        <br>**The Supreme Court held the ==Charter applies to every person physically present in Canada== and that “fundamental justice”, at a minimum, incorporates the common law rules of ==procedural fairness==, requiring the refugee claimant to be afforded an opportunity to state their case and know the case the case they have to meet. Justice Wilson also expressed the view that “where a serious issue of credibility is involved, fundamental justice requires that credibility be determined on the basis of an oral hearing.” See, Aiken, Grey, c. 4.**

    8. Your client recently attended an admissibility hearing at the IRB to determine whether they are a national security risk. During a break in the hearing, your client overhears the presiding member chatting with a colleague in the hallway. The member remarked that your client “is certainly a hoodlum and a bad actor – it is plain as day.” What should you do?
        - [ ] Swiftly initiate a notice of constitutional question and raise s.15 of the Charter as this is discrimination based on race, an enumerated ground
        - [x] Request that the presiding member step down on the basis of reasonable apprehension of bias.
        - [ ] Suggest your client retain counsel to begin a Charter claim in court against the Member.
        - [ ] All of the above
        <br>**This is indicative of an apprehension of bias, not a Charter breach – as there is no action or legislation that interferes with your client’s s.15 rights. Initiating a motion for recusal – that the member step down – on the basis of reasonable apprehension of bias, is the recommended course of action.**

    9. True or false: The Supreme Court of Canada has endorsed the application of the Oakes test, developed for evaluating the compliance of laws with the Charter, to determine the propriety of discretionary immigration decisions.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**==The Supreme Court of Canada has refused to apply the Oakes test==, developed for evaluating the compliance of laws with the Charter, to determine the propriety of discretionary administrative decisions, including discretionary immigration decisions. The alternative approach chosen by the Supreme Court of Canada was to analyze whether the administrative decision was ==reasonable== overall. Included in this analysis would be a consideration of whether the decision took Charter values sufficiently into account. This involves weighing whether the decision achieves a reasonable balance between furthering the objectives of the statutory regime under which the decision is made and the values underlying the Charter. This balancing exercise must ensure that the Charter protections are limited no more than is necessary to achieve the statutory objectives that the discretionary decision-maker is required to pursue. See, Nastasi, c. 3, pp. 73-74.**

    10. True or false: Provincial influence in relation to immigration matters has been waning in recent years.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**As noted by Mireille Paquet (cited in Aiken, Grey, c. 4), provincial influence over immigration matters has been growing, resulting in a more crowded and contested regulatory sphere.**

    11. True or false: the remedies tribunals can award under section 24(1) of the Charter are **not** the same as the remedies available to courts.
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False
        <br>**Section ==24(1) allows a court== of competent jurisdiction to provide any remedy that it considers “appropriate and just in the circumstances”. Some tribunals are deemed “courts of competent jurisdiction” while others are not (see Nastasi, c. 3, p. 75). Although this is a potentially broad power, in practice, ==tribunals, as creatures of statute, can only award remedies that are provided for in their enabling statute==. Absent a statutory power to grant remedies such as damages or costs, a tribunal does not have jurisdiction to grant these remedies (in contrast to actual courts). See, Nastasi, c.3, p. 74.**

    12. True or false: to successfully demonstrate that an immigration rule violates section 15 of the Charter, an applicant only has to establish that: the statute, program, policy, or activity results in a disadvantage being imposed on an enumerated ground.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**to successfully demonstrate that an immigration rule violates section 15 of the Charter, an applicant must establish two elements: that the statute, program, policy, or activity results in a ==disadvantage== being imposed on an enumerated or analogous ground; and this disadvantage results from ==discrimination==, which the Supreme Court has identified as “the perpetuation of prejudice or stereotyping.” See, Nastasti, c. 3, p. 69.**

    13. True or false: immigration status qualifies as an analogous ground under section 15 of the Charter.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**As per *Toussaint v Canada (Attorney General)*, 2011 FCA 213, Stratas JA held that immigration status does not qualify as an analogous ground under section 15 of the Charter. The reasons were: “immigration status is not a [characteristic] that we cannot change. It is not immutable or changeable only at unacceptable cost to personal identity”… and immigration status is a characteristic that the government has a legitimate interest in expecting the applicant to change. See, Aiken, Grey, c.4.**

    14. What is the threshold for triggering section 7 in relation to a provision of the IRPA or the Citizenship Act?
        - [ ] You need to demonstrate that the provision negatively impacted the person’s life, liberty, or security.
        - [ ] You need to demonstrate that the provision is connected to the negative impact.
        - [ ] You need to demonstrate that the breach is not in accordance with the principles of fundamental justice.
        - [x] All of the above

        **The onus is on the person claiming s.7 breach. This is established through two steps:**

        - (1) show there has been a ==negative impact==, and that the negative impact actually flows from the impugned legislation.
        - (2) Demonstrate that it is not justified under ==s.1.== See *Vigo v Canada* at para 49-50:

        > “[49] With a section 7 of the Charter claim such as this, the appellant first has to show that the impugned legislation ==negatively impacts== or limits her life, liberty or security of the person, thus engaging section 7 of the Charter.

        > [50] The appellant must show that the impugned law is sufficiently connected to the prejudice suffered before section 7 of the Charter is engaged, and even if section 7 is found to be engaged, the appellant must then show that the deprivation of her section 7 Charter rights is not in accordance with the principles of ==fundamental justice==.”

    15. Your client, who is currently applying for refugee status in Canada, experiences ongoing racial harassment by a neighbour and wants to pursue legal action. Is there a Charter remedy?
        - [x] No – the Charter does not apply to the neighbour’s actions.
        - [ ] Yes – the Charter provides a remedy for discrimination.
        - [ ] No – prospects for a Charter remedy are slim because it is a he said she said case.
        - [ ] Maybe – the client should retain a lawyer to assist with a Charter application – the courts will assess whether your client is protected by the Charter.
        <br>**The Charter applies to governments, government ministries/departments, agencies, boards, commissions, and some bodies that have public functions and receive public funding. It does ==not apply to private activities by private persons==. See Nastasi, c. 3, p. 62; and Aiken, Grey, c.4.**

    16. True or false: In immigration proceedings, the Charter has a broader reach than administrative law because all government bodies are subject to the Charter.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**Administrative law principles apply more broadly, whereas the ==Charter only applies to public actors== and decisions in specific circumstances. Many immigration and citizenship decisions, for example, are not subject to the Charter, but are subject to administrative law principles. See Nastasi, c. 3, pp 60-62; 73.**

    17. Match the items in the right-hand column below with the applicable provision of the Constitution or Charter in the left-hand column.
        - **Section 1 of the Charter:** The provision that places the onus on the government to justify the violation of a Charter right
        - **s. 2 of the Charter:** The ==open justice== principle (freedom of expression and others)
        - **s. 7 of the Charter:** fundamental justice - Disclosure of government's evidence in a security certificate proceeding
        - **s. 11 of the Charter:** A fair hearing before an independent and impartial tribunal for a person charged with an offense - Procedural Safeguard
        - **s. 12 of the Charter:** A decision to deport a non-citizen to a country where they may be tortured - against torture
        - **Section 13 of the Charter:** The right of witnesses against self-incrimination
        - **Section 14 of the Charter:** The right to an interpreter in a refugee status determination hearing before the IRB
        - **Section 15 of the Charter:** The accommodation of the religious customs or observances of a party or a witness in an administrative proceeding - discrimination
        - **Section 33 of the Charter:** The provision that authorizes Parliament or provincial legislatures to override certain Charter rights - "**notwithstanding**" Clause
        - **s 91 (25) of the Constitution Act, 1867:** Legislative authority over "Naturalization and Aliens"
        - **s 92 (13) of the Constitution Act, 1867:** Jurisdiction over "civil rights"

    18. True or false: section 15 of the Charter does **not** consider citizenship status to be an analogous ground of discrimination.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**In *Andrews v Law Society of British Columbia*, the Supreme Court of Canada held that non-citizens are a group lacking in political power and as such vulnerable to having their interests overlooked and their rights to equal concern and respect violated. ==Non-citizens fall into an analogous category== to those specifically enumerated in s.15. See, Aiken, Grey, c. 4.**

    19. Your client, a Canadian permanent resident, calls you in a panic. Their spouse, a member of a persecuted minority group from their country of origin with no legal status in Canada, has received a removal order and a specific date to report for removal to their country of origin. Your client is worried that their spouse will be targeted and harmed by the authorities if returned to their country of origin. Are Charter rights engaged?
        - [ ] Yes – because deportation always engages section 7 rights
        - [ ] No –because deportation never engages section 7 rights
        - [ ] No - because family unity is not protected under section 7
        - [x] Maybe - section 7 may be engaged in the context of removal proceedings (and efforts to defer or quash removal orders) where a risk of harm on return is established
        <br>**Where a risk of harm is alleged in the last stage of removal proceedings, s.7 may be engaged. This is a fact-specific analysis, and will require marshalling evidence to establish that your client’s spouse faces a serious risk of harm in their country of origin. ==Recent case law suggests that Charter arguments related to return cannot be raised before the IRB in most circumstances as those proceedings do not constitute the end point prior to removal See==, Aiken, Grey, c. 4.**

    20. Your client, a Canadian permanent resident, calls you in a panic. Their spouse, a citizen of the Netherlands, who has been living without legal status in Canada for some time, just received a removal order. Your client asks you to help them defer or quash the removal order with the benefit of Charter arguments under s.7 on the grounds that the decision infringes their liberty to enjoy family unity.  Is this possible?
        - [ ] Yes – because deportation always engages section 7 rights.
        - [ ] No – deportation of a non-citizen never engages section 7 rights.
        - [x] No - because courts do not recognize family unity as protected within the ambit section 7
        - [ ] Yes - because it restricts the freedom to have family unity under section 7.
        <br>**See *Begum v Canada* at para 100: "==Courts have consistently declined to recognize a right to family unity or family reunification under section 7==. In  *Medovarski*, for example, the appellant had argued that deportation would remove  "her liberty to make fundamental decisions that affect her personal life, including her choice to remain with her partner", and that her security would be infringed  "by the state-imposed psychological stress of being deported"  (at para. 45). The Supreme Court rejected that claim, stating that "the deportation of a non-citizen in itself cannot implicate the liberty and security interests protected by s. 7 of the [Charter]"  (at para. 46)." ==Section 7 may be engaged in removal proceedings where an individual faces risk of serious harm== in the country to which they are being removed. See, Aiken, Grey, c.4.**
