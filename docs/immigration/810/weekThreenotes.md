# Week 2: Notes and Quizzes

## Notes

???+ note "3.1 Introduction to Administrative Law"

      - Three areas of public law: constitutional law, criminal law and administrative law
      - Administrative law ensures that:
          - government actions are **authorized** by Parliament (or provincial legislatures)
          - laws are implemented in a **fair and reasonable** ( and sometimes, correct) manner
          - government decisions must be **legal** and individuals must have **remedies**
      - Besides immigration and citizenship law, administrative law also engaged in
          - Human rights
          - Extradition
          - Regulation of professions
          - others
      - **Jurisdiction**: the scope of the authority or powers conferred on a government body or official by legislation or by common law
      - **Discretion**: the power of a government official or agency to decide a course of action from among a variety of options available under the law
      - **Procedural fairness**: a decision-maker acting under a statutory power of decision must give any person whose rights, privileges or interests are affected by a decision reasonable notice of the case they have to meet and an opportunity to respond; and must be impartial.
      - **Rule against sub-delegation**: the principle that the particular person to whom a power or authority has been delegated may not re-delegate that power to someone else unless clearly authorized to do so by law.
      - **Subordinate legislation**: legislation made by a body other than Parliament or a provincial legislature (such as Cabinet, a Cabinet minister, an agency or a municipal council), as authorized by statute; generally includes regulations, proclamations, rules, orders, ministerial instructions or other instruments; also called “delegated legislation”; distinguished from statutes (or “acts”).
      - **Judicial review**: the exercise by a superior or other court granted authority by statute of its supervisory authority over ministries and other government agencies by reviewing whether they have carried out their functions in accordance with the principles of administrative law. *The Federal Court of Canada is the court of first instance for judicial review of immigration and citizenship matters*.
      - Courts should **defer to** decisions made by administrators
      - Governments may take actions that limit activities of citizens or their access to rights/benefits **only in accordance with substantive and procedural requirements prescribed by law**
      - The **rule of law** means government actors and decision -makers have powers/duties **limited by law** and must follow procedures set out in legislation when exercising them
      - *Roncarelli v Duplessis*, 1959 CanLII 50 (SCC), Headnote:
          - the cancellation of the permit was the result of an order given by the defendant to the manager of the Commission.
          - There was no authority enabling the defendant to direct the cancellation of a permit. The intent and purpose of that Act placed complete control over the liquor traffic in the hands of an independent commission.
          - Cancellation of a permit by the Commission, at the request or upon the direction of a third party, as was done in this case, was not a proper and valid exercise of the powers.
