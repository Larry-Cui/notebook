# Week 3: Notes and Quizzes

## Notes

??? note "3.1 Introduction to Administrative Law"

      - Three areas of public law: constitutional law, criminal law and administrative law
      - Administrative law ensures that:
          - government actions are **authorized** by Parliament (or provincial legislatures)
          - laws are implemented in a **fair and reasonable** ( and sometimes, correct) manner
          - government decisions must be **legal** and individuals must have **remedies**
      - Besides immigration and citizenship law, administrative law also engaged in
          - Human rights
          - Extradition
          - Regulation of professions
          - others
      - **Jurisdiction**: the scope of the authority or powers conferred on a government body or official by legislation or by common law
      - **Discretion**: the power of a government official or agency to decide a course of action from among a variety of options available under the law
      - **Procedural fairness**: a decision-maker acting under a statutory power of decision must give any person whose rights, privileges or interests are affected by a decision reasonable notice of the case they have to meet and an opportunity to respond; and must be impartial.
      - **Rule against sub-delegation**: the principle that the particular person to whom a power or authority has been delegated may not re-delegate that power to someone else unless clearly authorized to do so by law.
      - **Subordinate legislation**: legislation made by a body other than Parliament or a provincial legislature (such as Cabinet, a Cabinet minister, an agency or a municipal council), as authorized by statute; generally includes regulations, proclamations, rules, orders, ministerial instructions or other instruments; also called “delegated legislation”; distinguished from statutes (or “acts”).
      - **Judicial review**: the exercise by a superior or other court granted authority by statute of its supervisory authority over ministries and other government agencies by reviewing whether they have carried out their functions in accordance with the principles of administrative law. *The Federal Court of Canada is the court of first instance for judicial review of immigration and citizenship matters*.
      - Courts should **defer to** decisions made by administrators
      - Governments may take actions that limit activities of citizens or their access to rights/benefits **only in accordance with substantive and procedural requirements prescribed by law**
      - The **rule of law** means government actors and decision -makers have powers/duties **limited by law** and must follow procedures set out in legislation when exercising them
      - *Roncarelli v Duplessis*, 1959 CanLII 50 (SCC), Headnote:
          - the cancellation of the permit was the result of an order given by the defendant to the manager of the Commission.
          - There was no authority enabling the defendant to direct the cancellation of a permit. The intent and purpose of that Act placed complete control over the liquor traffic in the hands of an independent commission.
          - Cancellation of a permit by the Commission, at the request or upon the direction of a third party, as was done in this case, was not a proper and valid exercise of the powers.

??? note "3.2 Fairness and the Right to be Heard"

    - Procedural fairness has two main components: the right to be heard, the right to an impartial decision.
    - *Nicholson v Haldimand-Norfolk Regional Police Commissioners*, 1978 CanLII 24 (SCC): The appellant should have been told why his services were no longer required and given an opportunity to respond. While the appellant could not claim the procedural protections of a constable with more than eighteen month’s service, he should have been treated ‘fairly’ not arbitrarily.
    - Following *Nicholson*, Canadian procedural fairness case law was marked by the gradual expansion of ==the duty of fairness to all areas== of administrative decision making affecting an individual’s rights, privileges and interests.
    - *Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)*, 1999 CanLII 699 (SCC): **legitimate expectation?** Pass. **explanation for a decision?** Pass. **Reasonable apprehension of bias?** Fail, the immigration officer’s notes gave the impression that he may have been drawing conclusions based not on the evidence before him, but on the fact that the appellant was a single mother with several children and had been diagnosed with a psychiatric illness.
    - *Baker* is described as the "**most significant administrative law judgments ever delivered by the Supreme Court of Canada” because of its comprehensive discussion of administrative law principles**".
    - 5 factors to determine the degree of procedural fairness ("Baker Factors"):
        - Nature of the decision and process followed in making it: decisions that more closely resemble judicial decisions will more likely to require procedural protections akin to a trial
        - Nature of the statutory scheme: where there is no appeal procedure, procedural protections will be greater
        - Importance of the decision to person affected: decisions with significant consequences will require more procedural protections
        - Legitimate expectations of the parties: where a clear representation or promise as to the procedure to be followed is provided by the decision-maker, it is unfair to act contrary to that promise
        - The procedures chosen by the tribunal or decision-makers themselves: courts give weight to these choices
    - Not every administrative law decision will attract the duty to give reasons. Also, the duty to give reasons will vary according to the type of decision. However, the absence of reasons when circumstances dictate they are required, may serve as a basis for review under the duty of fairness
    - Sources of Procedural Fairness:
        - The *Citizenship Act*: prescribes application procedures in Part V of the Act while Part II of the Act prescribes fairly elaborate procedures for citizenship revocation.
        - The *IRPA*:
            - largely silent as to the procedures to be followed for most immigration matters.
            - An important exception concerns the IRB.
        - the *Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations* (IRPR) and the *Citizenship Regulations* do not include detailed procedural rules. However, the IRPR does impose some broad procedural parameters, including the default written nature of the hearing, and the right to representation.
        - policy instruments, including guidelines, program delivery instructions, operational manuals and operational bulletins, tend to be the ==most important source== of procedural entitlements, generating the right under the ==legitimate expectations== doctrine.
            - An important policy instrument in relation to all types of immigration and citizenship decision-making - outside the IRB context - is IRCC's [operational instructions on procedural fairness](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/procedural-fairness.html){:target="\_blank"}.
        - The common law or judge-made principles are another important source of procedural rights.
        - The *Constitution* and the *Charter*.
    - One important exception to the right to be heard: administrative decisions of a legislative nature may ==not== engage any entitlement to procedural fairness. In *Canadian Doctors for Refugee Care v Canada (Attorney General)*, 2014 FC 651, the Court provided that legislature did not give rise to participatory rights for the potentially infinite group of stakeholders.
    - Immigration decision makers disclose the information they rely upon in coming to a decision: the more significant the **interests** at stake, the more substantial the likely **impact** on these interests, and the more **adjudicative** (rather than regulatory or policy-driven) the proceeding, the greater the extent of disclosure.
    - [IRCC's operational instructions on procedural fairness](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/procedural-fairness.html){:target="\_blank"}:
        - processing without undue delay
        - fair and impartial decision-making
        - right to be heard
        - whoever hears must decide
        - legitimate expectation
        - decisions based on IRPA and IRPR
        - reasons of a decision

    |For written applications (CBSA or IRCC)| For oral interviews (CBSA or IRCC)| For oral hearings (IRB)|
    |---|---|---|
    |Notice and disclosure|Notice and disclosure|Notice and disclosure|
    |Right to be represented|Right to be represented (but may include limits on oral submissions or right to object)|Right to be represented|

## Quizzes

??? note "3.1 Administrative Law"

    1. Which of the following decisions typically would not attract a duty to act fairly?
        - [ ] Issuing a license to drive a taxi
        - [ ] Issuing a permit to build a septic system
        - [ ] Granting social assistance benefits
        - [x] Issuing immigration policy documents
        <br>**Legislative or policy decisions establishing rules or guidelines are generally not subject to the duty to act fairly. See Nastasi et al., Chapter 2 “Foundations of Administrative Law” , p. 40-41.**

    2. Administrative law applies to:
        - [ ] the relationship between levels of Canadian government
        - [ ] administrative agencies, tribunals and government decision-makers
        - [ ] the exercise of powers granted by statute
        - [x] B and C
        <br>**A is incorrect because the relationship between levels of government in Canada is governed by the ==Constitution==, not administrative law.**

    3. Which best describes the relationship between procedural fairness and natural justice?
        - [ ] Procedural fairness requires every decision maker to attend to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in making decisions whereas natural justice requires every decision maker to attend to the common law principles only.
        - [ ] Procedural fairness is the standard required of all agencies, including tribunals; whereas natural justice is the set of principles constituting fair procedure.
        - [ ] Procedural fairness requires that a person affected by a decision be given a formal hearing; whereas natural justice requires that the person be allowed to speak at their hearing.
        - [x] None of the above
        <br>**While natural justice was once seen as being distinct from procedural fairness, today the terms natural justice and procedural fairness are synonymous and can be used ==interchangeably== – as noted in Nastasi et al, Chapter 2 "Foundations of Administrative Law", p. 25.**

    4. True or false: Sarah Dunn is a newly appointed panel member with the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the IRB. Ms. Dunn was the sole decision-maker hearing a refugee claim and is unsure how she should decide the case. She decides to meet with two more experienced RPD members to consult with them on the case she just heard. This is not permissible under any circumstances.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**==Tribunal members are permitted to consult one another except where statutory limits or prohibitions are placed== on the right to consult. Therefore, absent an exclusion or limitation in the IRPA, the enabling legislation of the IRB, Ms. Dunn is free to consult other tribunal members when making decisions. However, Ms. Dunn must be the one making the final decision; the consultation must be voluntary; no one can put pressure on her to make a particular decision; and no new issues or facts are to be introduced without the claimant being notified and permitted to comment. See, Nastasi et al., Chapter 2 “Foundations of Administrative Law” , p. 34.**

    5. Which of the following is not something courts can generally do when hearing judicial review applications?
        - [ ] Declare that the action taken by a public official is contrary to the law
        - [ ] Order an official or agency to take any action required by law
        - [ ] Order an agency to follow a fair procedure in making a decision
        - [x] Declare that the administrative tribunal be disbanded
        <br>**As noted in Nastasi et al, Chapter 2 “Foundations of Administrative Law” at ==p. 54==, courts hearing judicial review applications can do A, B, and C in addition to quashing a decision already made, forbid a public official from taking or continuing any action that is prohibited by law; and order an agency to free a person who is illegally imprisoned. However, disbanding an administrative tribunal is not an available remedy on judicial review.**

    6. What test is used to determine whether or not a tribunal is impartial?
        - [ ] Actual bias
        - [ ] Institutional bias
        - [x] Reasonable apprehension of bias
        - [ ] Probability of bias
        <br>**As noted in Nastasi et al., in Chapter 2 “Foundations of Administrative Law” at p. 42, the test that has emerged from the case law is whether there is a “reasonable apprehension of bias” – not actual bias.**

    7. Which of the following is ==not true== about guidelines?
        - [ ] Policies and guidelines can be used to promote consistency and fairness in decision-making.
        - [x] Guidelines may be used to exclude choices provided by the law.
        - [ ] Guidelines must not be treated as binding.
        - [ ] Requiring government decision-makers to follow guidelines would be fettering of discretion.
        <br>**Guidelines are not treated as binding rules and should not be used to justify the exclusion of choices provided by the law. See, Nastasi et al., Chapter 2 “Foundations of Administrative Law” , pp. 33-34.**

    8. Which of the following doctrines is an exception to the general rule that there is no duty for government bodies and officials to consult with the public or with individuals for policy or minor administrative decisions?
        - [ ] Inherent powers doctrine
        - [ ] Procedural fairness doctrine
        - [x] Legitimate expectation doctrine
        - [ ] Implied powers doctrine
        <br>**Where a decision maker raises expectations that a certain procedure will be followed, either by promises or by a course of action on which people have come to rely, the decision maker may not change its practice or procedure where the change will have an adverse effect without first notifying the persons who will be affected and giving them an opportunity to comment on the proposed change. See, Nastasi et al., Chapter 2, at p. 40.**

    9. True or false: all Canadian courts have the power to judicially review decisions of administrative bodies.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**only ==superior== courts have the inherent power to review an alleged violation by an official or body.**

    10. The process whereby superior courts review alleged violations by an official or body of any fundamental principles of administrative law is known as:
        - [ ] Administrative review
        - [ ] Judicial oversight
        - [x] Judicial review
        - [ ] Administrative oversight
        <br>**See, Nastasi et al, Chapter 2 "Foundations of Administrative Law", p. 53.**

    11. A member of the Immigration and Refugee Board makes a finding that a refugee claimant violated a section of the Criminal Code. The decision is:
        - [ ] Within their jurisdiction and not reviewable on judicial review
        - [x] Not within their jurisdiction and potentially reviewable by the Federal Court
        - [ ] An issue of procedural fairness
        - [ ] B and C
        <br>**Administrative decision-makers should not make findings on matters outside their jurisdiction. Criminal Code offences are tried by courts.**

    12. Which of the following is a type of delegated legislation?
        - [ ] Statutes passed by provincial legislatures
        - [ ] Bills passed by the Senate
        - [ ] Policies developed by ministries
        - [x] Regulations made under statutes
        <br>**As noted in Nastasi et al., Chapter 2 “Foundations of Administrative Law”, p. 64, there are two types of delegated legislation: ==regulations== made under statutes, usually by Cabinet or a Cabinet minister, and ==by-laws== passed by municipalities.**

    13. Which of the following is not required when an adjudicator seeks advice from another tribunal member?
        - [ ] The adjudicator makes the final decision
        - [ ] The consultation is voluntary on the adjudicator’s part
        - [x] The parties to the decision grant the adjudicator permission
        - [ ] No new issues or facts are introduced without the parties being notified and permitted to comment
        <br>**As noted in Nastasi et al., Chapter 2 “Foundations of Administrative Law”, p. 34, A, B, and D are required along with the stipulation that no one who is consulted puts pressure on the adjudicator to make a particular decision.**

    14. *Roncarelli v Duplessis*, the seminal case on rule of law, addresses issues of administrative overreach. If the case were to occur now, another possible argument(s) for Mr. Roncarelli would be:
        - [ ] There was a breach of his rights under the *Charter of Rights and Freedoms*.
        - [ ] A liquor license is a right.
        - [ ] This was a breach of procedural fairness.
        - [x] A and C
        <br>**The decision to revoke his liquor license breached his right to procedural fairness – the decision was made without notice and with no opportunity to respond. The decision targeted Mr. Roncarelli because he posted bail for members of his religious community and might, accordingly, violate his rights under the *Charter*.**

    15. Which of the following is not a limit on a decision-maker’s right to choose among options?
        - [ ] Discretion must be exercised in good faith.
        - [ ] The decision-maker must only consider relevant factors.
        - [ ] Similar cases should be treated in a similar way.
        - [x] Discretion must always be exercised in accordance with binding rules.
        <br>**The four limits on a decision-maker’s right to choose among options are set out in Nastasi et al., Chapter 2 “Foundations of Administrative Law” at ==pp. 31-32==.**

    16. What are two functions of the rule of law in society?
        - [ ] To ensure criminals are punished for their crimes
        - [x] To ensure society operates according to a set of rules enshrined in supreme law
        - [x] To ensure that laws apply to everyone equally, including those in positions of power
        - [ ] To ensure that the Charter of Rights and Freedoms is followed by every citizen
        <br>**With a clear system of rules, everyone knows what is expected of them, how they will be treated and what to expect from others. The rule of law ensures that there will be a legal response to any arbitrary or unjust actions. The rule of law also means that everyone is subject to the law. No one, no matter how important, how rich, how educated, or how powerful, is above the law. Laws apply to everyone equally, including those in positions of power.**

    17. True or false: You are a legal representative who unsuccessfully represented your client at an administrative hearing. When you receive the decision, you are concerned that the adjudicator was biased. You would like to recommend that your client apply to the courts to review the decision, but the enabling statute of the administrative tribunal does not provide a right of appeal and contains a provision prohibiting the courts from reviewing the administrative tribunal’s decisions. It is therefore not possible to have the courts review the tribunal’s decision.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**Despite the enabling legislation not having a right of appeal and containing a provision prohibiting the courts from reviewing the decision, judicial review would still be available. Because the right to judicial review is constitutional in nature, it cannot be taken away by any provision of a statute purporting to deny the right. It is therefore available even where a statute expressly prohibits a court from reviewing an administrative body’s decisions. See, Nastasi et al., Chapter 2 “Foundations of Administrative Law” , p. 53-54.**

    18. The scope of the authority or powers conferred on a government body or official by legislation or by common law is called:
        - [ ] Implied power
        - [ ] Discretion
        - [x] Jurisdiction
        - [ ] Sub-delegation
        <br>**See Nastasi et al., Chapter 2 “Foundations of Administrative Law”, pp. 29-30.**

    19. True or false: Certain decision makers may be subject to more rigorous procedural safeguards than others.
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False
        <br>**All types of administrative bodies and many types of decisions may be subject to a duty to act fairly. Nevertheless, certain agencies may be subject to more rigorous procedural safeguards than others. Specifically, tribunals must follow formal procedures similar to those followed by the courts. Additionally, the obligation of impartiality applies more strictly to tribunals than it does to other government decision-makers. See, Nastasi et al., Chapter 2 “Foundations of Administrative Law”, pp. 39-40.**

??? note "3.2 Fairness and the Right to be Heard"

    1. Which of the following statements is true?
        - [ ] In H&C applications, the onus rests on the officer to ensure that they have all the necessary information and documents from the applicant; otherwise, a request for additional information should be made before making a final decision.
        - [ ] Applicants are commonly recommended to make a refugee claim and submit an H&C application simultaneously to increase their chances of getting approved.
        - [ ] To apply for permanent residence under the H&C class outside Canada, the applicant must submit the Application for Permanent Residence from Outside Canada—Humanitarian and Compassionate Considerations form (IMM 5001) and the Supplementary Information form (IMM 5283).
        - [x] Failed refugee claimants are barred for 12 months from applying for H&C considerations unless they have a child under 18 who would be adversely affected by the decision.
        <br>**Under section 25(1.2) of the IRPA, failed refugee claimants are barred for 12 months from applying for H&C considerations following the latest of the following: a negative decision by the RPD, the RAD, the Federal Court, or a final decision that the claimant withdrew or abandoned their claim. As noted in Desloges & Sawicki, c. 9, p. 399, ==this bar does not apply to refugee claimants who have children under 18 who would be adversely affected by the claimant’s removal==.**

    2. True or false: The codification of the principle of “best interests of a child” into the IRPA means that the interests of the child outweigh all other factors in an H & C application. Factors affecting children should be given paramount consideration by decision-makers when making an H&C decision that directly affects a child.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**The codification of the principle of “best interests of a child” into the IRPA does not mean that the interests of the child outweigh all other factors in a case. While factors affecting children should be given substantial weight, the ==best interests of a child== is only one of many important factors that the decision-maker needs to consider when making an H&C decision that directly affects a child. See: Government of Canada, Operational Instructions: "Humanitarian and compassionate considerations: Assessment and processing”: "Best Interests of the Child."**

    3. Which of the following refers to the H&C exemptions?
        - [x] Section 25 of the IRPA
        - [ ] Section 25 of the IRPR
        - [ ] IRCC Inland Processing Manual number 2
        - [ ] Part 4 of the IRPA

    4. True or false: As set out in Operational Instructions, applicants may base their requests for H&C consideration on a specified list of factors only.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**Applicants may base their requests for H&C consideration on ==“any relevant factors”==, including but not limited to: establishment in Canada for in-Canada applicants; ties to Canada; the best interests of any children directly affected by the H&C decision; factors in their country of origin including adverse country conditions; health considerations including inability of a country to provide medical treatment; family violence considerations; consequences of the separation of relatives; inability to leave Canada has led to establishment (in the case of applicants in Canada); ability to establish in Canada for overseas applications; any unique or exceptional circumstances that might merit relief. See: Government of Canada, Operational Instructions: "Humanitarian and compassionate considerations: Assessment and processing”: "Hardship and the H&C Assessment".**

    5. True or false: Once an application for permanent residence on H & C grounds is submitted to IRCC for an applicant in Canada, it is not permitted to provide updates to the file.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**As noted by lawyer Will Tao in “The Alternative Remedy: Humanitarian and Compassionate Grounds Applications”, Migrant Conversations, at min. 22:47 – 23:20 (in onQ), ==file updates are very important==. It is not uncommon for applicants to wait two or even two and a half years for a decision. During that time updates which address positive changes to your client’s situation can be very helpful: for example, evidence of greater establishment in Canada or worsening conditions in their country of origin. It is up to the client or their representative to provide file updates. IRCC will not ask for additional information. See, Desloges & Sawicki, c. 9, p. 398.**

    6. Which of the following is not a component of the right to be heard?
        - [ ] The right to notice
        - [ ] The right to representation
        - [x] The right to select tribunal members
        - [ ] The right to be present
        <br>**See, Nastasi, Chapter 4, “Fairness: The Right to Be Heard”, pp 86-100.**

    7. The Baker factors:
        - [ ] include the legitimate expectations of the administrative decision-maker.
        - [ ] require non-citizens seeking to remain in Canada on humanitarian and compassionate grounds to be provided with a full oral hearing.
        - [ ] do not take into account the procedural choices made by administrative decision-makers.
        - [x] None of the above

        **Procedural fairness is “contextual,” not absolute. The Supreme Court set out five factors to assist in the determination of the appropriate level of fairness and the specific procedures that must by followed by the a tribunal or other decision-maker.** These include:

          - the nature of the decision;
          - the nature of the statutory scheme;
          - the importance of the decision to the affected person;
          - the extent to which the person affected has legitimate expectations of a particular process;
          - and the extent to which the legislature intended the decision-maker to have discretion to choose its own procedures.

        **See Nastasi et al., Chapter 4, “Fairness: The Right to Be Heard” p. 85.**

    8. True or false: Parties have a right to be represented at a tribunal, and the right includes an absolute right to an adjournment where necessary to obtain legal representation.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**In circumstances where a party received adequate notice of the hearing and time to retain a legal representative, an adjournment may very well be denied on the basis that it will cause delay and increased costs. A party is only entitled to a ==reasonable== opportunity to find representation. See Nastasi, Chapter 4, “Fairness: The Right to Be Heard”, p. 93.**

    9. In Derek McKee’s “Guidelines (‘Soft Law’)” video lecture, which of the following does he say about guidelines?
        - [ ] They promote consistency in statutory interpretation
        - [ ] They can be functionally similar to regulations
        - [ ] They can be an alternate to open-ended discretion to promote consistency
        - [x] All of the above

    10. What must adequate notice of a hearing provide to the affected parties?
        - [ ] An explanation of what the hearing is about that is sufficient to allow them to prepare to address the issue
        - [ ] Sufficient time to prepare
        - [x] An **explanation** of what the hearing is about that is sufficient to allow them to prepare to address the issues and sufficient **time** to prepare
        - [ ] Sufficient time to prepare and disclosure of evidence
        <br>**See Nastasi, Chapter 4, “Fairness: The Right to Be Heard” pp. 88-89.**

    11. Lydia applied for permanent residence on H&C grounds from inside Canada. After waiting for several years, she just learnt that her application was refused. What legal recourse does Lydia have available to her if she wishes to challenge the officer’s decision?
        - [ ] Lydia can appeal the officer’s decision to the Immigration Appeal Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board as long as she has new evidence that arose after the officer’s refusal.
        - [ ] Lydia can appeal the officer’s decision to the Immigration Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board.

        <br>**As noted in Desloges & Sawicki, c. 9 at p. 405, there is ==no appeal from a refused permanent residence application on H & C grounds==. An Application for leave and for judicial review may be filed with the Federal Court within 15 days of the date of refusal in the case of decision on an application from inside Canada, or 60 days in the case of a decision for an application from outside Canada.**

        - [ ] reference letters from employers, schools, and volunteer organizations
        - [ ] a statutory declaration from the applicant swearing to the truth of their story
        - [ ] an opinion letter about the negative mental or physical effects on any children affected by the decision
        - [x] an expert affidavit attesting to the applicant’s well founded fear of persecution in their country of origin
        <br>**As noted in Government of Canada, Operational Instructions: "Humanitarian and compassionate considerations: Assessment and processing”: "Hardship and the H&C Assessment", “Subsection 25(1.3) of the IRPA states the following: ‘... the Minister may not consider the factors that are taken into account in the determination of whether a person is a Convention refugee under section 96 or a person in need of protection under subsection 97(1) but must consider elements related to the hardships that affect the foreign national’. In other words, ==officers do not determine whether a well-founded fear of persecution, risk to life, danger of torture and risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment has been established, but they may take the underlying facts into account in determining whether the applicant will face hardship if returned to their country of origin==.”**

    14. Claudio is a foreign national who is seeking permanent residence on humanitarian and compassionate grounds.  He has called your office to ask questions about making an H&C application.  Claudio went onto the IRCC website and found many different types of immigrations forms, but could not find an application form for foreign nationals making an H&C request from outside of Canada.  Which of the following advice should you give to Claudio?
        - [ ] Claudio could not find the required forms online because as a foreign national, he can only apply under the H&C class from within Canada.
        - [ ] He does not require an application form under the public policy exemptions.
        - [x] There are no specific H&C forms available for those applying outside Canada.  Applicants should include the written request for consideration on H&C grounds along with the PR visa.
        - [ ] H&C applications are very concise applications consisting primarily of the Supplementary Information form (IMM 5283).
        <br>**See, Desloges & Sawicki, Chapter 9, s. IV.  In general, H&C applications made from outside of Canada do not require specific forms.  A written request for H&C considerations should be included along with the application for a PR visa.**

    15. True or false: It is not uncommon for draft decisions at a tribunal to go through a peer quality assurance review or for tribunal members to consult each other while drafting their decisions. There are no limits placed on these practices.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**Unless the consultation is required by statute, it must be voluntary; the tribunal chair and other members must not put any pressure on the adjudicator; the consultation should be limited to questions of law and policy. The adjudicator must be free to disregard the advice coming from the consultation. See Nastasi, Chapter 4, “Fairness: The Right to Be Heard” pp. 95-98.**

    16. True or false: You represent a client at the Immigration Refugee Board. You receive a Notice of Decision a few weeks after the hearing. The document consists of a prescribed form with checkboxes and no other explanation. There are two boxes: “accepted” and “rejected”. The “rejected” box is marked with an “X”. The reasons for decision violate the requirements of procedural fairness.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**In Liang v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), (1999) FCJ No 1301 (TD), a court accepted checking a box on a prescribed form as sufficient to fulfill the requirement to provide reasons. Where reasons are given, but are inadequate, this is not a breach of procedural fairness. In other words, deficiencies or flaws in the reasons given do not fall under the category of a breach of the duty of procedural fairness. See Nastasi, Chapter 4, “Fairness: The Right to Be Heard” pp. 99-100.**

    17. What is the purpose of cross-examination?
        - [x] To give parties the chance to challenge the evidence given by the other side’s witnesses
        - [ ] To test the character of the witnesses
        - [ ] To present the facts of the case
        - [ ] None of the above
        <br>**See, Nastasi, Chapter 4, “Fairness: The Right to Be Heard” p. 96.**

    18. In Craig Forcese’s video lecture, “Procedural Content: The Right to be Heard Pt 1”, he expresses a fear about the guidance provided by the Supreme Court in *Baker v Canada* in relation to how much procedural entitlement a recipient is owed. What is it?
        - [ ] That decision-makers will stop following the relevant jurisprudence
        - [ ] That the case dilutes audi alteram partem and risks breaching the fundamental principles of procedural fairness
        - [x] That case reinforces the impression of objectivity and masks the degree of subjectivity
        - [ ] None of the above
        <br>**See, “Procedural Content: The Right to be Heard Pt 1”, at min. 14:02 – 14:17.**

    19. What is the result if a statute or regulation sets out a more specific fairness requirement than the common law in a particular situation?
        - [x] The statutory requirement takes precedence.
        - [ ] The statutory requirement will take precedence only if it is more onerous.
        - [ ] The common law requirement always takes precedence.
        - [ ] The common law requirement will take precedence only if it is more onerous.
        <br>**See Nastasi, Chapter 4, “Fairness: The Right to Be Heard”, p. 85.**
