## Notes

<!-- ??? note "IOM, _“Chapter 2, Migration and Migrants: A Global Overview” in World Migration Report 2024_, pp. 19-52"

    **281** million people are living outside the country of their birth – up from 173 million in 2000 – but in percentage terms – just **3.6** percent of the world’s population.

??? note "Stephen Castles, _“International Migration at the Beginning of the Twenty-first Century: Global Trends and Issues”_ (2000) 52:227-228 Intl Soc Science J 151"

    Migration means crossing the boundary of a political or administrative unit for a certain minimum period (Boyle et al. 1998,chapter 2)

??? note "_Root Causes of Migration_"

    - Safety Factors
    - Economic Factors
    - Environmental Factors
    - Social Factors

??? note "Franceso Castelli, _“Drivers of Migration: Why Do People Move?”_ (2018) 25:1 J of Travel Medicine 1"

    According to the International Organization for Migration (IOM), a migrant is ‘any person who is moving or has moved across an international border or within a State away from his/ her habitual place of residence, regardless of

     - (1) the person’s legal status;
    - (2) whether the movement is voluntary or involuntary;
    - (3) what the causes for the movement are; or
    - (4) what the length of the stay is’,

    a broad definition indeed.

    **Drivers of migration:**

    - Inadequate human and economic development
    - Demographic increase, urbanization
    - Climate changes
    - Wars and dictatorship
    - Land grabbing (The term ‘land grabbing’ refers to the intensive exploitation of vast areas of land in rural areas of low-income countries by private international enterprises or even by foreign governments in order to implement large-scale intensive cultivations (mainly biofuels and food crops) or to exploit minerals, forestry or the touristic industry)
    - Religion
    - Sexual identity
    - Education
    - Personal willingness to migrate  -->

??? note "1.1.3"

    - A combination of law and policy aimed at sustaining the British character of Canada and excluding those who were deemed incapable of contributing to the government’s assimilationist project of nation building was responsible for a relatively static population of racialized groups in Canada through to the **1950s**
    - Census figures indicate that prior to **1961**, only 3% of immigrants were persons of colour
    - Married women were classified along with minors, lunatics, and “idiots under a disability” – all of whom were generally unable to become naturalized or control their national status as **independent persons**
    - “Canadians” were British subjects until **1947** when Canada enacted its first Citizenship Act and **Canadians became citizens of their own country**
    - The new Citizenship Act also gave married **women autonomy** with respect to their status: the nationality of a married woman no longer depended on that of her husband
    - Despite sustained attention to discrimination and racism in Canada's immigration history, little is written about the relationship between immigration law and Canada's Indigenous populations
    - Canada's mythology as a "nation of immigrants" is one reflection of the **silencing of Indigenous** peoples in the national narrative
    - **The Immigration Act of 1976 was a turning point** in Canada’s legislative history with respect to immigration
    - Implemented in 1978, it explicitly committed Canada to **non-discrimination** in the application of immigration law and policy and established Canada’s first **refugee determination system**
    - In the intervening years, Canadian immigration law and policy has shifted **from overt racism to systemic racism**
    - Systemic racism: racial discrimination manifests systemically in the practices, policies and laws that **appear neutral** on their face but have an adverse impact on racialized people
    - Public officials, including the Canadian Prime Minister, acknowledge that “[s]ystemic racism is an issue right across the country, in all our institutions… It is recognizing that the systems we have built over the past generations have not always treated people of racialized backgrounds… fairly through the very construction of the systems that exist.” See, Catherine Tunney, [*“Systemic racism exists in RCMP, Trudeau argues — after commissioner says she's 'struggling' with the term”*](https://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/rcmp-systemic-racism-lucki-trudeau-1.5607622){:target="\_blank"}, CBC News, 11 June 2020
    - Today the two most important pieces of legislation with respect to Canadian immigration are *the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA)* and *the Citizenship Act*.
    - Arguably, immigration law was “invented” in order to keep people out, and only secondarily became a mechanism for letting people in.

??? note "1.1.5"

    - The right of states to admit or exclude aliens is well established under **international law**
    - As James Nafziger explains, it is usually considered **an attribute of sovereignty and territoriality** and is defended as an inherent power necessary for the self-preservation of the state. At the same time, as Nafziger asserts, “The proposition that states have an absolute right to deny territorial access to all aliens has unusual resilience and resonance, but **little historical or jurisprudential foundation**.”
    - In [Chiarelli v Canada, [1992] 1 SCR 711](https://scc-csc.lexum.com/scc-csc/scc-csc/en/item/855/index.do){:target="\_blank"}, Sopinka J held:
    > “The most fundamental principle of immigration law is that **non-citizens do not have an unqualified right to enter or remain in the country**. At common law an alien has no right to enter or remain in the country… Parliament has the right to adopt an immigration policy and to enact legislation prescribing the conditions under which non‑citizens will be permitted to enter and remain in Canada. It has done so in the Immigration Act.”
    - In Revell v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), 2019 FCA 262, the Federal Court of Appeal explicitly followed Chiarelli.
    - Open borders theory has three versions:
        1. With narrow exceptions for “dangerous foreigners”, states have a *prima facie* **duty to maintain** open borders
        2. Affluent, democratic societies are **morally obligated** to admit immigrants as a partial response to global injustices, such as poverty and human rights violations
        3. Freedom of international movement/migration is characterized as a basic liberty or a fundamental, unqualified **human right**
    - In all three versions, **citizenship status, in itself, is not an ethical basis** for distributing rights and social positions.
    - States have a broad **right** to control their borders, including a right to regulate immigration in accordance with national priorities.
    - The **moral reasons** for restrictive immigration controls include the need to preserve “national identity”, the values, as well as the standard of living of residents in host states.
    - States have **limited obligations** to grant admission to the relatives of current citizens, displaced ethnic nationals, and/or some refugees narrowly defined.
    - Democratic societies are obliged to help needy strangers **only when**:
        - their need is acute; and
        - the risks and costs of giving it are relatively low for the other party.

## Quizzes

??? note "Quiz: 1.1.1 The Contemporary Global Context"

    1. If we apply Francesco Castelli’s analysis to Guatemala, we can infer that the poorest and least educated Guatemalans are the ones most likely to immigrate to the United States of America.
          - [ ] True
          - [x] False
    <br>**False: Castelli points out that the poorest people don’t usually have the means to escape their home countries.**

    2. How does Stephen Castles characterize the overall impact of international migration?
          - [ ] Migration constitutes a win-win situation for sending and receiving countries.
          - [x] Migration has can have both positive and negative consequences for sending and receiving countries depending on the character of the migration event and the actions of the stakeholders involved.
          - [ ] Despite its positive financial reproductions, migration has negative consequences on cultural identity and national sovereignty.
          - [ ] Castles refrains from characterizing the overall impact of international migration, which he says is too complex to theorize accurately.
    <br>**B: Castle warns against glorifying or condemning the overall impact of international migration. He advocates a balanced recognition of potentially positive and negative impacts.**

    3. Which of the following represents a potential “pull factor” for a Central American to migrate to Canada?

          - [ ] Decreasing opportunities in the Canadian agricultural sector due to crop failure
          - [x] High-quality graduate school programmes in Canada
          - [ ] Widespread gang violence in Guatemala
          - [ ] Persecution of the LGBTQ+ community in El Salvador

    4. Which of the following best describes the place of “irregular migration” in the context of global migration?
          - [ ] We have absolutely no idea how much irregular migration takes place because it’s so hard to track.
          - [ ] Irregular migration is a huge problem, and irregular migrants are responsible for taking political attention away from legitimate refugees and asylum seekers.
          - [x] Irregular migration constitutes a small fraction of global mobility. Its importance is inflated by politicians and the media.
          - [ ] All of the above

    5. In today's globalized world, a large portion of the world's population (just under 20%) lives outside the country of their birth.
          - [ ] True
          - [x] False
    <br>**False: Only 3.6% of the world's population lives outside their country of birth.**

    6. Which of the following best describes the relationship between education and migration?
          - [x] The relationship between education and migration is twofold, involving both the negative impacts of the **brain drain** and the benefits of **international remittances**.
          - [ ] The migration of educated people from poor-middle income countries constitutes a loss of human resources for the origin countries, which many refer to as the “brain drain.”
          - [ ] The migration of educated people from poor-middle income countries bolsters international remittances, which can constitute a significant part of the origin country’s economy and support its education system.
          - [ ] The poorest and least educated people are those most likely to migrate in search of better lives.

    7. The majority of refugees (almost two thirds) reside in high-income Western nations (e.g., Canada, Australia, and the US).
          - [ ] True
          - [x] False
    <br>**False: 80% of refugees live in countries neighbouring their countries of origin. Turkey hosts the largest number of refugees with 3.6 million, most of whom are Syrian.**
    <br>**The "two thirds statistic" refers to the number of international migrants who reside in high-income nations but not all of those are Western.**

    8. Which of the following best describes the relationship between the ‘push and pull’ theory of migration with Francesco Castelli’s macro-, meso- and micro-drivers of migration?
          - [ ] The ‘push and pull’ theory is older and no longer relevant.
          - [x] The ‘push and pull’ theory remains relevant for didactic purposes, but Castelli’s theory fleshes out the national, local and individual drivers of migration in a more complex way.
          - [ ] The ‘push and pull’ theory and Castelli’s macro-, meso- and micro-drivers of migration contradict each other, so one needs to choose between them.
          - [ ] None of the above

    9. Stephen Castles places the blame for anti-immigrant sentiment on extreme-right political parties.
          - [ ] True
          - [x] False
    <br>**False: Castles argues that governments bear some responsibility for anti-immigrant sentiment, because they have inadequately prepared their citizens for the cultural and social changes that accompany immigration.**

    10. Recent trends indicate that high-income countries are receiving more and more migrants.
          - [ ] True
          - [x] False
    <br>**False: In recent years, the number of migrant workers declined slightly in high-income countries while increasing elsewhere.**

    11. According to Francesco Castelli, destination countries don’t need to justify welcoming migrants on humanitarian grounds because they benefit financially in the medium- and long-term.
          - [ ] True
          - [x] False
    <br>**False: Castelli argues that destination countries have to reconsider justifying their migration policies on financial terms. They have to be willing to accept migrants for the good of the migrants themselves and for the migrants’ countries of origin.**

    12. Match the term and its abbreviated definition.
          - Stateless person: A person who is not considered as a national by any state
          - Internally displaced person: An individual who has been forced to flee their home (e.g., to avoid armed conflict) and who has not crossed an international border
          - Asylum seekers: An individual who is seeking international protection, but whose claim has not yet been decided
          - Migrant: An umbrella term, not defined under international law, which reflects the common lay understanding of a person who moves away from their usual residence
          - Irregular migrants: A person who has moved across an international border and is not authorized to enter or stay in a state
          - Refugee: A person recognized as a refugee on the basis of criteria related to the circumstances in their country of origin

    13. Which of the following are the top refugee-hosting countries?
          - [ ] Canada, the United States and Australia
          - [ ] Canada, the United States and Germany
          - [x] Turkey, Pakistan and Uganda
          - [ ] Turkey, Lebanon, and Germany
    <br>**C: Canada, the United States and Australia resettle the most refugees, but Turkey, Pakistan and Uganda host far more than the wealthy Western countries.**

    14. In the Americas most victims of trafficking are female, and most are trafficked for the purpose of sexual exploitation.
          - [x] True
          - [ ] False
    <br>**True: Over 80% of trafficking victims in the Americas are women and over 70% of that trafficking is done for the purpose of sexual exploitation.**

    15. Which of the following best describes the current state of global migration:
          - [ ] More people are migrating than ever before and most are leaving their countries of origin.
          - [ ] International migration rates are down from the "refugee crisis" of 2015.
          - [x] International migration rates are at an all-time high, but most migrants continue to remain within the borders of their home country.
          - [x] International migration rates have increased numerically over the last 20 years, but they remain stable as a proportion of the world's population.
    <br>**D is also somewhat true, but rates have risen from 2.8% in 2000 to 3.6% in 2020, which makes C a better answer.**

    16. When mobility regimes are not impeded by global pandemics, the overwhelming majority of people migrate internationally for reasons related to work, family and study.
          - [x] True
          - [ ] False
    <br>**As noted in Chapter 2 of the Global Migration Report 2022, the Covid-19 pandemic resulted in unprecedented immobility globally.  The report also notes that vast majority of people migrate internationally for reasons related to work, family and study (at p. 21).**

    17. According to the World Migration Report 2022, which of the following statements best describes international migration trends:
          - [ ] The overall number of international migrants has remained the same over the past 50 years.
          - [x] The proportion of international migrants as a share of the total global population has increased incrementally.
          - [ ] North America is largest destination for international migrants.
          - [ ] None of the above
    <br>** The World Migration Report 2022 reports that overall number of international migrants has increased over the past 50 years, and the proportion international migrants as a share of the total global population has increased at an incremental level.  Europe is the largest destination for international migrants, followed by Asia and then North America (at pp. 23-24)**

    18. Forced displacement is at a record high, but we're not sure if rates will continue to rise.
          - [x] True
          - [ ] False
    <br>**True: Forced displacement is at a record high, but it is difficult to predict the future, because forced displacement is closely tied to acute events (e.g., armed conflict).**

    19. Which of the following best describes why the terms “migration” and/or “migrant” are so difficult to define:
          - [ ] Someone’s migration event can be defined in relation to several different factors (e.g., their place of birth, citizenship, or place of residence).
          - [ ] We need definitions of “migrant” and “migration” for different fields, including: legal, administrative, and research.
          - [ ] “Migrant” is an umbrella term that reflects a common lay understanding of a person who moves away from their usual residence. It has no legal definition under international law.
          - [x] All of the above

<!-- ------------This is a separator between quizzes-------------- -->

??? note "Quiz: 1.1.2 The Canadian Context"

    1. According to our edition of Migration Policy Debates (MPD), which of the following best describes immigrants’ contributions to the public purse?
          - [ ] In the long term, immigrants contribute as much in taxes and social contributions as they receive in individual benefits (i.e., they have a neutral impact on the public purse).
          - [x] In most countries, immigrants contribute more in taxes and social contributions than they receive in individual benefits (i.e., they represent a net gain).
          - [ ] An average immigrant contributes more than an average native-born citizen to the public purse and uses fewer public resources.
          - [ ] All of the above
    <br>**B: We can rule out answer A, because the MPD claims that immigrants contribute more than they take from the public purse. We can rule out answer C, because the average immigrant contributes to the public purse, but “to a lesser extent than the native-born.”**

    2. True or false: According to Aiken et al (i.e., the introduction to Immigration and Refugee Law) refugees are an important part of Canadian migration policy.
          - [ ] True
          - [x] False
    <br>**False: Refugee movement is governed by an international legal framework. Canadian migration policy focuses on attracting immigrants “to address their demographic and labour force deficits” (Aiken et al 5).**

    3. In “Can Canada Handle a Rational, Polite and Fact-Based Debate About Immigration,” Herbert Grubel argues…
          - [ ] …that the Canadian government pushes immigration against the will of the people.
          - [ ] …that immigrants decrease Canada’s GDP per capital because they earn lower wages.
          - [ ] …that reducing immigration will reduce income inequality because immigrants earn lower wages.
          - [x] …all of the above

    4. Which of the following is a true statement about how migration contributes to economic growth?
          - [x] Immigrants are (on average) younger than the native-born population, meaning they boost the working-age population.
          - [ ] Immigrants are (on average) more educated than the native-born population, meaning they contribute more to technological progress.
          - [ ] Immigrants expand the workforce and contribute to aggregate GDP, but they decrease the GDP per capita because they earn (on average) less than the native-born population.
          - [ ] All of the above
    <br>**A: Migration boosts the working-age population. Answer B has an element of truth. Highly educated immigrants do contribute to technological progress, but the article does not claim that immigrants are (on average) more educated than their native-born counterparts. You came across answer C in the Grubel readings, but the Migration Policy Debates contradict Grubel, arguing that immigrants to add a small increase to GDP per capita.**

    5. Jock Finlayson’s and David Williams’s “Immigration is not a cure-all for Canada’s economic woes” pushes back on which of the following economic argument(s) in favour of immigration?
          - [ ] Canada’s decreased level of immigration in the face of the Covid-19 pandemic places Canada’s economy in jeopardy.
          - [ ] Immigration has a net positive impact on GDP per capita.
          - [ ] Immigration changes the age structure of the population (i.e., boosts the working-age population).
          - [x] All of the above
    <br>**D: Note that Finlayson and Williams do not agree with Grubel that immigration has a negative impact on GDP per capita. They argue that the impact is neutral.**

    6. Which of the following best describes the dominant trends in Canadian immigration from the 1970 through 2010?
          - [ ] Europeans made up a smaller and smaller proportion of immigrants to Canada, while Asians made up a larger and larger proportion.
          - [ ] Europeans went from the largest immigrant group to the smallest, while Asians went from the smallest immigrant group to the largest.
          - [x] Europeans went from the largest immigrant group (nearly 80%) to a much smaller proportion of the total (about 10%), while Asians went from a small group (less than 10%) to the largest group (nearly 60%).
          - [ ] All of the above
    <br>**C: Note that the percentage of Asians was at its highest from 2001-2005 and then fell slightly (which rules out answer A) and the Asians never constituted the smallest immigrant group (which rules out answer B).**

    7. According to Aiken et al, Immigration and Refugee Law, what best describes the function of immigration law vis-à-vis citizenship law?
          - [ ] Immigration law is neutral in allowing immigrants entry and then citizenship law is discriminatory in deciding who can stay.
          - [x] Immigration law is discriminatory in allowing entry, and then citizenship law is neutral in deciding who can stay.
          - [ ] Immigrants face equally discriminatory practices in the face of immigration and citizenship law.
          - [ ] Immigrants face equally neutral practices in the face of immigration and citizenship law.
    <br>**B: See page the following quotation from Aiken et al: “Immigration law is principally about discrimination, about asserting a nation’s prerogative to be discriminating in immigrant selection. This overt discrimination means that citizenship law is freed to take a more neutral posture.”**

    8. True or false: The Migration Policy Debates (May 2014) and Gabriel Friedman's "All the reasons why Canada needs immigration – and more of it," both conclude that immigration generally has a net positive impact on the economy, even in the case of low-income immigrants.
          - [x] True
          - [ ] False
    <br>**True: Both the Migration Policy Debates (May 2014) and Gabriel Friedman claim that immigration has a net positive impact on the economy. On the other hand, Herbert Grubel and Patrick Grady claim the net impact is negative, and Jock Finlayson and David Williams claim the net impact is neutral.**

    9. In “Who gets in?”, Barry Greenwald exposes the following feature(s) of Canada’s immigration.
          - [ ] Applying as an independent immigrant (i.e., an immigrant without family connections to Canada) is “like playing the lottery”: the rules can change at any time.
          - [ ] People are refused based on the subjective criteria of “personal suitability” and “political suitability.”
          - [ ] Canadian immigration officials “meter the rate of racial change” because they feel Canadians can only cope with so much change at one time.
          - [ ] All of the above
    <br>**D: All of the above quotations are taken directly from Greenwald’s “Who gets in?”.**

    10. According to Sharry Aiken, immigration law dismantles barriers, so that more people can migrate.
          - [x] True
          - [ ] False
    <br>**False: Sharry Aiken argues that immigration law constructs barriers that make it more difficult for people to migrate.**

    11. Which of the following paraphrases the main implication(s) of Herbert Grubel’s and Patrick Grady’s “Setting the record straight on the benefits, and heavy costs, of immigration to Canada”?
          - [ ] Canadians have been hoodwinked into believing that immigration has a positive impact on the Canadian economy.
          - [ ] Not only do immigrants burden the Canadian economy, they also congest the highway system; overcrowd the hospitals, schools and recreation facilities; and destroy the environment.
          - [ ] In the absence of verifiable data, economists can rely on whatever assumptions they deem plausible.
          - [ ] All of the above
    <br>**D: Herbert Grubel’s and Patrick Grady’s article must be read critically. Its authors situate themselves on the far right of the Canadian political spectrum. Their views are highly controversial.**

    12. Gabriel Friedman’s “All the reasons why Canada needs immigration – and more of it,” describes the relationship between immigration rates and health-care costs as…
          - [ ] …a positive correlation in which scaling back immigration rates would decrease future health-care costs.
          - [ ] …an inverse correlation in which scaling back immigration rates would raise future health-care costs.
          - [ ] …a statistically insignificant relationship.
          - [ ] …none of the above.
    <br>**B: According to Friedman, if we decrease immigration rates, health care costs will go up.**

    13. True or false: Gabriel Friedman’s “All the reasons why Canada needs immigration – and more of it,” presents immigration as a perfect solution to Canada’s increasing old-age dependency ratio (i.e., the number of working people per senior citizen).
          - [ ] True
          - [x] False
    <br>**False: Immigration will mitigate the impact of the increasing old-age dependency ratio, but it won’t solve it completely.**

    14. According to Barry Greenwald’s “Who gets in?”, what major change(s) to Canadian immigration policy occurred in 1989?
          - [ ] Canada tightened its regulations on refugees entering the country.
          - [ ] Canada delegated the entire task of selecting refugees to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR).
          - [ ] Canada began screening immigration candidates on the basis of race.
          - [ ] All of the above
    <br>**A: Answer B is wrong because Canada did not delegate the entire task of selecting refugees to the UNHCR. Canada asked the UNHCR to make an initial selection, and then narrowed down the UNHCR’s candidates further. Answer C is wrong because Canada had been screening immigration candidates on the basis of race well before 1989.**

    15. Barry Greenwald’s “Who gets in?” describes ______________as an “immigration officer’s dream.”
          - [ ] Hong Kong
          - [ ] India
          - [ ] Africa
          - [ ] Canada
    <br>**A: The citizens of Hong Kong are strong candidates for the economic class of immigrants: they have money, motivation, and entrepreneurial skills. The film juxtaposes the favourable treatment (or recruitment) of Hong Kong citizens with the cautious and sceptical treatment of their African counterparts. Even heroic Africans who had risked their lives to save others and fight injustice were not granted access to Canada. The implication is that entrepreneurialism (not self-sacrificing heroism) makes the ideal Canadian immigrant.**

    16. List the four main immigration streams by which individuals can seek to remain in Canada on a permanent basis.
          - [ ] Economic; family; study; refugee or protected person
          - [ ] Economic; family; refugee or protected person; humanitarian and compassionate
          - [ ] International Mobility Program; Francophone Permanent Resident Program; Refugee Program; and Protected Person Program
          - [ ] All of the Above
    <br>**B: Answer A is ruled out because study permits are a temporary form of immigration. Answer C is ruled out because the International Mobility Program is also temporary and the other programs do not exist, at least not under those names.**

    17. According to Migration Policy Debates (May 2014), what are the three areas one has to examine in order to decide whether migration is good for the economy?
          - [ ] The labour market, the public purse, and economic growth
          - [ ] The education levels of migrants, the scope of the receiving country’s social benefits, and the average age of the native-born population
          - [ ] The type of migrants (e.g., labour or refugee), the average age of the native-born population, and the labour shortages of the receiving country
          - [ ] None of the above
    <br>**A: All the other factors contribute to the debate on the role of migration in the economy, but they are subordinate to the three overarching areas of the labour market, the public purse and economic growth.**

??? note "Quiz: 1.1.3 Building a Settler Society"

    1. True or false: In 2014 Canada became the first Commonwealth country to apologize to and compensate its Chinese immigrants, who were forced to pay the Chinese head tax from 1885 to 1923.
          - [ ] True
          - [x] False
    <br>**False: New Zealand was the first country to compensate its Chinese immigrants. Efforts at redress in Canada are ongoing.**

    2. According to Lindsay Van Dyk’s “*Canadian Immigration Acts and Legislation*,” which of the following pieces of legislation represented an attempt to block Black settlement in Canada:
          - [x] Order-in-Council PC 1911-1324
          - [ ] Naturalization Act, 1914
          - [ ] Immigration Act Amendment, 1919
          - [ ] Order-in-Council PC 1962-86
    <br>**Order-in-Council PC 1911-1324 represents the “fullest expression” of anti-Black racism in Canadian immigration history. It banned Blacks from immigrating to Canada based on their supposed “climatic unsuitability.”**

    3. Match the name of court case, decision or act to its description.
          - **Canada v Singh; Re Munshi Singh:** detain and deport a passenger aboard the *Komagata Maru*.
          - **Quong-Wing v. The King:** This ruling of the Supreme Court of Canada upheld a discriminatory provincial law preventing white women from working or frequenting Asian-owned/managed businesses.
          - **Union Colliery of British Columbia v. Bryden:** Used the federal government’s power to invalidate overtly racist provincial legislation against Chinese men, who had been prohibited from working in coal mines on the basis of race
          - **Hayashi-Lemieux Agreement:** Canada agreed not to impose discriminatory laws in relation to immigration from Japan in return for a promise that the Japanese government impose emigration controls (i.e., limit the number of Japanese immigrants to 400 a year).
          - **Immigration Act, 1910:** Allowed the government to prohibit the landing of immigrants “belonging to any race deemed unsuited to climate or requirements of Canada”

    4. According to Sean Rehaag and Sharry Aiken's article, "It's time to abolish the inhumane Canada-U.S. deal on asylum seekers," *the Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA)* between Canada and the United States prohibits asylum seekers from making a refugee claim at a Canadian border crossing, but does not prohibit asylum seekers from crossing into Canada irregularly and making a refugee claim.
          - [x] True
          - [ ] False

    5. In “*From Slavery to Expulsion: Racism, Canadian Immigration Law and the Unfulfilled Promise of Modern Constitutionalism*,” Sharryn Aiken’s main argument is best paraphrased as:
          - [ ] Canada should have open borders, because immigration is a right, not a privilege.
          - [x] Modern constitutionalism has failed to deliver the systemic changes required for a truly anti-racist immigration program.
          - [ ] Flows of capital and information are creating a “borderless world” but immigration law continues to strengthen Canadian national borders.
          - [ ] Canadian citizenship and immigration laws establish a hierarchical classification of “insiders” and “outsiders,” even among people already living and working in Canada.
    <br>**B: Aiken does not make an explicit argument for open borders (which rules out answer A). She does highlight the tension between the “borderless world” of capital and information and the border-creating world of immigration law, but this argument is secondary (which rules out C). Answer D paraphrases the main argument of Nandita Sharma (2005). Answer B best captures the main argument of Aiken’s article as reflected in the article’s title and thesis statement: “I contend however, that for immigrants and refugees the promise of transformative litigation remains wholly unfulfilled [i.e., by modern constitutionalism.]”**

    6. True or false: According to Lindsay Van Dyk’s “*Canadian Immigration Acts and Legislation*,” Immigration Regulations, Order-in-Council PC 1962-86 finally eliminated racial discrimination from Canadian immigration policy.
          - [ ] True
          - [x] False
    <br>**False: Order-in-Council PC 1962-86 did away with “overt” racial discrimination, but elements of covert discrimination remain today. For more detail see Aiken “From Slavery to Expulsion.”**

    7. Watt v Liebelt best demonstrates which of the following?
          - [ ] When immigration law clashes with Indigenous rights, immigration law takes precedence.
          - [ ] When immigration law clashes with Indigenous rights, Indigenous rights take precedence.
          - [x] There is an enormous gulf between immigration law and Indigenous rights, which has yet to be mapped.
          - [ ] There is no tension between immigration law and Indigenous rights.
    <br>**C: Watt v Liebelt illustrates that there is tension between immigration and Indigenous rights (which rules out answer D), but it does not illustrate which set of laws takes precedence (which rules out answers A and B).**

    8. True or false: Jamie Liew’s “*Canada’s pandemic plans must guard against the rise of racism*” argues that public health officials should not collect race-based data on the Covid-19 pandemic because it will contribute to a rise of racism.
          - [ ] True
          - [x] False
    <br>**False: Liew argues that “It’s a good first step that some governments are collecting race-based data on the impact of the disease, but more action is required. All governments must acknowledge that how people perceive the spread of this virus can place a disproportionate burden on racialized persons, and that racialized people will experience the pandemic differently, whether they are Asian, Black, Indigenous or Latinx.”**

    9. According to Kaitlin Jingco’s "*Battling everyday, casual racism in Canada*,” Canadians deal with the following expressions of casual racism?
          - [ ] Many Asian Canadians feel pressure to live up to stereotypes of higher intellect and levels of achievement.
          - [ ] Many Black Canadians feel the need to counteract stereotypes of delinquency (e.g., drugs and violence).
          - [ ] Many people of color have to deal with the assumption that they are immigrants.
          - [x] All of the above

    10. Match the term to its definition:
          - **systemic discrimination:** The institutionalization of discrimination through policies and practices which may appear neutral on the surface but which have an exclusionary impact on particular groups.
          - **racial discrimination:** Any distinction, exclusion, restriction or preference based on race, colour, descent, or national or ethnic origin, which nullifies or impairs the recognition, enjoyment or exercise of human rights and fundamental freedoms in the political, economic, social, cultural or any other field of public life.
          - **systemic racism:** This is an interlocking and reciprocal relationship between the individual, institutional and structural levels which function as a system of racism.
          - **racialization:** The process through which groups come to be socially constructed as races, based on characteristics such as race, ethnicity, language, economics, religion, culture, politics, etc.
          - **stereotype:** A preconceived generalization of a group of people. This generalization ascribes the same characteristic(s) to all members of the group, regardless of their individual differences.
          - **white privilege:** The inherent advantages possessed by a white person on the basis of their race in a society characterized by racial inequality and injustice.
          - **structural racism:** These ideologies are inscribed through rules, policies and laws; and represents the ways in which the deep rooted inequities of society produce differentiation, categorization, and stratification of society's members based on race.

    11. Why was Union Colliery shareholder John Bryden unsuccessful in his efforts to obtain an injunction against the company for breaching the provincial *Coal Mines Regulation Act*?
          - [ ] Because the provincial law was discriminatory
          - [x] Because the pith and substance of the provincial law fell within federal jurisdiction in relation to "aliens and naturalized subjects"
          - [ ] Because the *Coal Mine Act* fell within provincial jurisdiction

??? note "Quiz: 1.1.4 Indigenous Peoples & Immigration Law"

    1. Which of the following are true about the ways in which the Immigration & Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) regulates the legal status of Indigenous peoples?
          - [ ] The IRPA permits Indigenous peoples to enter and remain in Canada.
          - [ ] The IRPA grants status to Indigenous peoples and sets out their rights to enter and remain in Canada.
          - [x] Section 19(1) of the IRPA states that Indians, who have status as defined by the Indian Act, have the right to enter and remain in Canada.
          - [ ] The IRPA permits Indigenous peoples who are not registered under the Indian Act a right to enter and remain in Canada.
    <br>**Aiken, Grey, et al, "*Building a Settler Society, Immigration and Refugee Law: Cases, Materials and Commentary*", 3rd ed. (Emond:2020); Indigenous Peoples and Immigration Law.**

    2. Indigenous peoples have had laws that govern community membership, as well as movement across territorial boundaries, for thousands of years.
          - [x] True
          - [ ] False
    <br>**Indigenous Peoples and Immigration Law - Episode 1:. Introduction to Indigenous peoples and legal traditions in Canada**

    3. Which one of the following statements is true about how Canadian immigration law regulates the status of Indigenous peoples in Canada?
          - [ ] If a First Nation in Canada adopts a non-Indigenous person who is not a Canadian citizen, that person cannot be deported.
          - [ ] Indigenous peoples in Canada have the power to grant Indian status and issue status cards.
          - [ ] Indigenous peoples in Canada have always been free to leave their reserves without permission from an Indian agent.
          - [x] Indigenous peoples in Canada are not free to determine their own status.

    4. Which of the following is true about Indigenous peoples in Canada?
          - [ ] Indigenous peoples are overrepresented in Canada's prisons, particularly Indigenous women.
          - [ ] Under previous versions of the Indian Act, Indigenous women who married a non-status male would lose their own status.
          - [ ] In the mid-20th century – an era known as the "60's Scoop" – Indigenous children were forcibly removed from their families.
          - [x] All of the above are true.

    5. Marietta is a member of the Lummi Nation, whose traditional territory extends from present-day Washington State in the U.S. into British Columbia, Canada. She is a U.S. citizen born and residing on the Lummi Reservation in Washington. <br> True or false: Marietta has the right to cross the US-Canada border as long as she remains within her nation’s traditional territories and waters.
          - [ ] True
          - [x] False

??? note "Quiz: 1.1.5 Philosophical Debates on Migration and the Regulation of Borders"

    1. True or false: Joseph H Carens acknowledges that his argument for open borders comes from the liberal tradition and he does not believe that it applies to cultures and nations who reject liberalism.
          - [ ] True
          - [x] False
    <br>**False: See page 124. In the face of communitarian objections, Carens stands by the very universalist claims of liberalism. He says “respect for the diversity of communities does not require us to abandon all claims about what other states ought to do.”**

    2. In "Membership," Michael Walzer writes disparagingly about "global libertarianism" and "global socialism." Which texts from Module 1.1.5 could best be classified under those terms?
          - [ ] Wellman and Carens, respectively.
          - [ ] Wellman and Anderson/ Sharma/ Wright, respectively.
          - [x] Caplan and Anderson/ Sharma/ Wright, respectively.
          - [ ] Caplan and Carens, respectively.
    <p class="highlight red">C: Wellman and Carens are liberals, which rules out A, B and D. Caplan advances a no-border politics that would result in a "global libertarianism". Anderson, Sharma, and Wright advance a no-borders politics that would overturn capitalism and nationalism and put into place "different economic and social structures." They don't use the term "socialism", but they are clearly dedicated to liberating the global working class from exploitation, which could be understood under the umbrella term "socialism."</p>
            - **liberals:** Wellman, Carens, Caplan
            - **Socialism:** Anderson, Sharma, Wright

    3. In “Migration: controlling the unsettled poor,” Bridget Anderson surveys the history of British laws against vagrancy in order to…
          - [ ] …undermine essentialist conceptions of the “migrant” and “the citizen.”
          - [ ] …highlight the hypocrisy of viewing work as a “right,” which is unavailable to migrants, but a “duty,” which is imposed upon citizens.
          - [ ] …show how national laws have always tried to coerce the poor, both locally and globally.
          - [x] All of the above
    <br>**D: Anderson’s argument is complex, which is why she’s written an entire book on it. Answers A, B, and C are all correct. She wants to soften the seemingly hard distinction between citizen and migrant. She argues that it is hypocritical to treat work as an unobtainable “privilege” for some but an unavoidable “duty” for others. And she wants to highlight the parallels between the Medieval “vagrant” and the 21st -century migrant, both of whom are subject to forces they cannot control.**

    4. In “Why No Borders?” Bridget Anderson, Nandita Sharma and Cynthia Wright argue that a No Borders politics will…
          - [x] …spark a radical change by which capitalism and nationalism would be replaced by different economic and social structures.
          - [ ] …have a positive impact on labour markets while maintaining the status quo of capitalism and national citizenship.
          - [ ] …undermine welfare protections, national identities, and liberal democratic values.
          - [ ] …bring about a utopian future where wealth is equitably distributed and war is a thing of the past.
    <br>**A: The authors of “Why No Borders?” do not hide their desire for radical change. They see open borders as incompatible with capitalism and nationalism (which rules out B). They refer to the concern expressed in answer C as the “catastrophe prediction.” But they do not pretend to be offering a utopian vision (which rules out D).**

    5. According to Sadiya Ansari's reading of Joseph Carens in "What Do Borders Really Do?", what's the difference between a "criminal offence" and a "civil violation" and why does it matter to immigration?
          - [ ] Charging undocumented migrants with a "criminal offence" gives rise to a criminal record, whereas charging them with a "civil violation" does not. The distinction matters because the criminalization of undocumented migrants effectively bars their path to citizenship.
          - [ ] Undocumented migrants should be charged with a "criminal offence" if they cross the border illegally, but asylum seekers should only be charged with a "civil violation" as they have not broken any laws.
          - [x] A "criminal offence" implies a more dangerous threat to the public than a "civil violation." Treating undocumented migration as a "criminal offence" fuels the myth that migrants are criminals.
          - [ ] All of the above
    <br>**C: Answer A is incorrect because Ansari does not go into the details about how "criminal offences" and "civil violations" impact one's chances for citizenship. Answer B is incorrect because Carens does not think anyone should be charged with a "criminal offence" just because they cross a border irregularly.**

    6. True or false: In "The Global Philosopher: Should Borders Matter?", the moderator Michael Sandel summarizes the conversation by pointing to the central role that economics played in the various contributions.
          - [ ] True
          - [x] False
    <br>**False: Michael Sandel summarizes the conversation by undermining the role played by economics and pointing to the deeper issues at the core of debates around immigration: one's duties to fellow citizens versus one's duties to humanity and the definition of patriotism as a virtue or a prejudice.**

    7. True or false: In “Aliens and Citizens: The Case for Open Borders,” Joseph H Carens agrees with Bridget Anderson, Nandita Sharma and Cynthia Wright, who argue that open borders will erase the distinction between aliens and citizens (i.e., the nationalist paradigm).
          - [ ] True
          - [x] False
    <br>**False: See page 125, where Carens argues that “to say that membership is open to all who wish to join is not to say that there is no distinction between members and non-members.”**

    8. In “Membership,” what rights does Michael Walzer think political communities have to close their borders to “strangers”?
          - [ ] No rights: Walzer advances an Open Borders politics based on the analogy of neighbourhoods and states.
          - [ ] Minimal rights: Walzer argues that states should be able to limit the flow of refugees in order to maintain social order.
          - [x] Strong rights: Walzer argues for the “forceful claim for admission” of some refugees, but even then he thinks states are entitled to prioritize refugees who share their religion and political ideology.
          - [ ] Unrestricted rights: Walzer allows political communities to completely shut their borders to foreigners, including refugees in life-threatening danger.
    <br>**C: Walzer is not for open borders, which rules out Answer A. Answer B best describes Carens’s argument, not Walzer's. C is correct because Walzer argues for the “forceful claim for admission” of some refugees, but even then he thinks states are entitled to prioritize refugees who share their religion and political ideology. Answer D goes too far for Walzer who do think we have the obligation to help those in life-or-death situations.**

    9. In “Membership and Justice,” Michael Walzer states unequivocally that his main concern is…
          - [ ] how to reconcile membership rights and the claims of justice.
          - [x] how to disentangle membership rights from the claims of justice.
          - [ ] how to limit membership rights in favour of the claims of justice.
          - [ ] how to write so opaquely that few readers can understand him.
    <br>**The first sentence of “Membership and Justice” reads: “The distribution of membership is not pervasively subject to the constraints of justice.” Walzer doesn’t want to reconcile membership rights and the claims of justice. He wants membership rights to take precedence. Answer D has some merit, but Answer B is Walzer’s main concern.**

    10. According to Andrew Griffith’s “How to debate immigration issues in Canada,” who is “guilty” of the following argumentative flaws: “immigration boosters,” “immigration critics” or both?
          - **both:** Disregarding inconvenient evidence
          - **immigration critics:** Citation of a contested Fraser Institute study
          - **immigration critics:** The overuse of anecdotal evidence
          - **immigration boosters:** Unwillingness to acknowledge concerns over shared values
          - **immigration boosters:** Ignoring the importance of public support for certain issues
    <br>**Note: Notice that the “contested Fraser Institute study” was written by Patrick Grady and Herbert Grubel, whose articles we covered in Unit 1.3**

    11. In “Membership,” Michael Walzer argues that which of the following offers the best analogy for the moral life of contemporary states?
          - [ ] Neighbourhoods: “One ought to be able to go and come as one likes, provided one has the financial resources to do so.”
          - [ ] Clubs: “Like clubs, states can regulate people coming in but they can’t stop people from leaving.”
          - [x] Families: “Like families, the citizens of states are morally connected to people whom they did not voluntarily choose.”
          - [ ] Country clubs: “You are lucky if Daddy and Mommy got you into a good one. Otherwise you’ll need to make a lot of money and put yourself on a waiting list.”
    <br>**C: The analogy between states and neighbourhoods was part of “classical political economy” in the nineteenth century. The economists argued “for perfect freedom of contract, without any political restraint” (108). Walzer attacks the state-neighbourhood analogy, claiming that in the absence of state borders neighbourhoods themselves would become mini-states: “To tear down the walls of the state is not…to create a world without walls, but rather to create a thousand petty fortresses” (109).” Walzer likes the state-club analogy with regard to the law, but he does not think it captures the “moral life” of a state (110). Walzer likes the family-state analogy the best for describing the “moral life” and refuge-granting dimensions of the state (111).**

    12. In “Aliens and Citizens: The Case for Open Borders,” Joseph H Carens argues that in the case of immigration to the United States, the difference between an “ideal theory” and “nonideal, real world” is best characterized as:
          - [ ] Nonexistent: ideal theory demands free migration, and the same would be necessary to ensure justice in the “nonideal, real world” of the United States.
          - [ ] Nonexistent: ideal theory does not demand free migration, and nor does justice in the “nonideal, real world” of the United States.
          - [x] Limited: ideal theory demands free migration, but some level of border restrictions can be justly imposed in the pursuit/defense of public order. That being said, current restrictions in the United States far outstrip such a level.
          - [ ] Significant: ideal theory demands free migration, but justice in the “nonideal, real world” of the United States needs to consider historical realities, which make strict border controls necessary to prevent the country being overwhelmed by immigrants and Americans from losing their wealth and culture.
    <br>**C: See page 122 for the summary of Carens’ argument “In sum, nonideal theory provides more grounds for restricting immigration than ideal theory, but these grounds are severely limited. And ideal theory holds up the principle of free migration as an essential part of the just social order toward which we should strive.”**

    13. In “The Global Philosopher: Should Borders Matter?”, Michael Sandel uses Jean-Jacques Rousseau’s claim in The Social Contract (1762) that “the sentiment of humanity evaporates and weakens as it is extended over the whole world” to show…
          - [ ] …that 21st-century technology might play a role in strengthening our compassionate ties to humanity.
          - [ ] …that little has changed since the 18th century: patriotism and cosmopolitanism still vie with each other for hearts and minds.
          - [ ] … that Rousseau thought patriotism was stronger than cosmopolitanism (i.e., that compassion connected people to their fellow citizens more strongly than to foreigners from “Tartary or Japan.”)
          - [x] All of the above
    <br>**D: Sandel uses Rousseau to show that the debate over patriotism vs. cosmopolitanism 1) is not new, 2) that it has not changed much in the last 250 years and 3) that technology may yet tip the scales in favour or cosmopolitanism (i.e., global citizenry).**

    14. True or false: On a moral level, Joseph Carens (as interpreted by Sadiya Ansari) argues that national border restrictions are akin to the feudal system that Western society rejected because it did not want the randomness of birth to limit or dictate one’s chances in life.
          - [x] True
          - [ ] False
    <br>**True: Ansari quotes Carens as saying “To be born into a rich state like Canada, the U.S. or the European states is like being born into the nobility […] The point of the open borders argument is to get people to see that we have organized the world in a way that can’t possibly be justified if you take seriously the idea that every human being ought to count.”**

    15. True or false: In “Aliens and Citizens: The Case for Open Borders,” Joseph H Carens argues that open borders are a logical extension of liberalism.
          - [x] True
          - [ ] False
    <br>**True: See page 124. “I think these recent developments [e.g., Civil Rights Movement…] reflect something fundamental about the inner logic of liberalism. The extension of the right to immigrate reflects the same logic: equal treatment of individuals in the public sphere.”**
