# Week 6: Notes and Quizzes

## Notes

??? note "6.1: Refugee protection"

    - The principle of **non-refoulement** is commonly regarded as ‘the cornerstone of international refugee law’. Its primary source is Article 33(1) of the Geneva Convention: ‘No Contracting State shall expel or return (“refouler”) a refugee in any manner whatsoever to the frontiers of territories where his life or freedom would be threatened on account of his race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group or political opinion’. In Canada, the right to non-refoulement has been incorporated into **s. 115** of the IRPA.
    - In the wake of increasing asylum claims in the 1980s, many governments have launched a series of “**interdiction**” measures aimed at preventing or deterring would-be asylum seekers from reaching their territories.
    - “First country of arrival” or “safe third country agreements” have been adopted in domestic refugee laws to bar access to asylum procedures to claimants who have traveled through a so-called safe third country en route to their destination.
    - The [Canada–US Safe Third Country Agreement](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/agreements/safe-third-country-agreement.html){:target="\_blank"} was signed in 2002 as part of the US-Canada Smart Border Action Plan and implemented in 2004 with the formal designation of the United States. On March 24, 2023, Canada and the United States announced that, as of March 25, 2023, the **STCA** and the Additional Protocol would be expanded across the **entire land border, including internal waterways**.
    - There are two pathways to receiving protection in Canada:
        - an application for refugee protection, determined by the Refugee Protection Division and the Refugee Appeal Division of the **IRB** (IRPA, **s. 95(1)(b)**); or
        - an application for protection determined by **an officer** of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, in some cases together with a delegate of the Minister, as part of a “**pre-removal risk assessment**” (PRRA) (IRPA, s. 95(1)(c))
    - The requirements of the refugee definition as set out in **s. 96**: three basic elements of the refugee definition: inclusion, exclusion and cessation; as well as the scope of protection afforded under **s. 97** of the IRPA for individuals who don’t meet the s. 96 requirements.
    - The Supreme Court of Canada’s decision in [Canada (AG) v. Ward, [1993] 2 SCR 689](https://canlii.ca/t/1fs1h){:target="\_blank"} is a foundational case on the test for determining a “**well founded fear of persecution**” in order to make a claim for refugee status. Among other important rulings, the Court held that persecution need not originate from the state, and that mere inability to provide protection is sufficient to establish a claim for persecution. The Court also offered guidance on the meaning of “**particular social group**” within the refugee definition of the Convention.
    - Refugee protection is not necessarily intended to be permanent. Refugees may face the loss of their protected person status **if they are not yet a Canadian citizen** and the IRB decides that they have re-established themselves in their home country or ‘re-availed” themselves of their home country’s protection. The details are set out in **section 108** of the IRPA.
    - There are two main classes of refugees under the Refugee and Humanitarian Resettlement Program: The **Convention refugee abroad class** and the **humanitarian – protected abroad class**.
    - Resettled refugees come to Canada in the following ways:
        - through the federal **Government-Assisted Refugee (GAR)** Program (which includes the Joint Assistance Sponsorship Program)
        - with the assistance of civil society groups through the **Private Sponsorship of Refugees (PSR)** Program, or
        - through the **Blended Visa Office–Referred** Program, which combines government and private support
    - Using a **trauma-informed approach** to interviewing clients is beneficial to both the legal practitioner and the clients for many of the following reasons:
        - Results in better quality and quantity of information obtained
        - Helps clients feel empowered
        - Minimizes the risks of re-traumatization
    - The Four Rs of a trauma-informed approach:

??? note "6.2: Detention & removal"

    - There is **no statutory limit** (or even soft law limit) to the length of immigration detention in Canada (90 days for France; while for EU member states, the upper limit is 18 months).
    - In the absence of actual law reform, the grounds upon which detention is mandated remains the same and judicial oversight remains limited. The Federal Court considers only the “**reasonableness**” of detention review decisions, and frequently stays release decisions and upholds continued detention orders.
    - **Section 55 of IRPA** sets out the grounds for detaining **non-citizens** with a warrant, without a warrant, upon entry, and upon designation as an irregular arrival.
        - IRPA, **s 55(1)** gives immigration officers the discretion to issue a **warrant** for the arrest and detention of permanent residents or foreign nationals who the officer has reasonable grounds to believe are **inadmissible** and are a **danger** to the public or are **unlikely to appear** for examination, for an admissibility hearing, for removal from Canada, or at a proceeding that could lead to the making of a removal order by the Minister under s 44(2).
        - IRPA, **s 55(2)** allows officers to **arrest** foreign nationals (other than protected persons)
            - (a) who the officer has reasonable grounds to believe are inadmissible and are a danger to the public or are unlikely to appear for examination, an admissibility hearing, removal from Canada, or at a proceeding that could lead to the making of a removal order by the Minister under s 44(2); or
            - (b) if the officer is not satisfied of the identity of the foreign nationals in the course of any procedure under this Act.
        - IRPA, **s 55(3)** allows for the **detention** of permanent residents or foreign nationals upon entry to Canada if the officer
            - (a) considers it necessary to do so in order for the examination to be completed; or
            - (b) has reasonable grounds to suspect that the permanent residents or foreign nationals are inadmissible on grounds of security, violating human or international rights, serious criminality, criminality, or organized criminality.
        - Finally, **s 55(3.1)** requires the **mandatory detention** upon entry into Canada of foreign nationals designated as “irregular arrivals” or the arrest and detention without a warrant of such designated persons after entry.
    - Separate detention provisions exist for persons who are subject to a security certificate. These persons may be arrested and detained upon issuance of a warrant if there are reasonable grounds to believe that the person is a danger to national security or to the safety of any person or is unlikely to appear at a proceeding or for removal (IRPA, **s 81**).
    - Where a person has been detained, notice is immediately provided to the ID of the IRB, the body that is competent to review the reasons for detention. Except for designated foreign nationals, the first review of the continued reasons for detention will occur within **48 hours**; the second at least once within **7 days**, and then at least once during each **30-day** period.
    - **Section 58** of the IRPA specifies when a person held in detention should not be released: **58 (1)** The Immigration Division shall order the release of a permanent resident or a foreign national **unless** it is satisfied, taking into account prescribed factors, that
        - (a) they are a danger to the public;
        - (b) they are unlikely to appear for examination, an admissibility hearing, removal from Canada, or at a proceeding that could lead to the making of a removal order by the Minister under subsection 44(2);
        - (c) the Minister is taking necessary steps to inquire into a reasonable suspicion that they are inadmissible on grounds of security, violating human or international rights, serious criminality, criminality or organized criminality;
        - (d) the Minister is of the opinion that the identity of the foreign national—other than a designated foreign national who was 16 years of age or older on the day of the arrival that is the subject of the designation in question—has not been, but may be, established and they have not reasonably cooperated with the Minister by providing relevant information for the purpose of establishing their identity or the Minister is making reasonable efforts to establish their identity; or
        - (e) the Minister is of the opinion that the identity of the foreign national who is a designated foreign national and who was 16 years of age or older on the day of the arrival that is the subject of the designation in question has not been established.
    - Sections **244 to 249** of the Regulations specify the factors that must be taken into account when a decision to detain or to continue detention is being made on various grounds. The constitutionality of a similar detention review regime that applied these factors at regular intervals—despite the fact that there is no upper limit on the duration of detention [*Charkaoui v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)* 2007 SCC 9].
    - Several **policy documents** also guide detention practices:
        - Enforcement Manual on Detention, which provides guidance to officers on the reasons for and length of detention, and alternatives to detention: “ENF 20: Detention,” [Online PDF](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/resources/manuals/enf/enf20-det-en.pdf){:target="\_blank"}
        - Enforcement Manual on Deposits and Guarantees, which provides guidance to officers in relation to the deposits and guarantees that may be required for a detainee’s release: “ENF 8: Deposits and Guarantees” [Online PDF](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/resources/manuals/enf/enf08-eng.pdf){:target="\_blank"}
        - Enforcement Manual on Alternatives to Detention, which provides guidance to officers in relation to the conditions that can be imposed on individuals: “ENF 34: Alternatives to Detention”: [Online PDF](https://www.canada.ca/content/dam/ircc/migration/ircc/english/resources/manuals/enf/enf34-eng.pdf){:target="\_blank"}
        - The Immigration Division Rules, SOR/2002-229, which includes the rules applicable to detention review hearings before the Immigration Division;
        - the IRB’s Chairperson Guideline 2: Detention, which provides guidance to the Immigration Division on detention review and release: Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada, “Chairperson Guideline 2: Detention” (April 2021), [Online](https://irb.gc.ca/en/legal-policy/policies/Pages/GuideDir02.aspx){:target="\_blank"}.
    - For the vast majority of people, the reason they are detained is flight risk pursuant to **s 58(1)(b)** of the IRPA.
    - Federal Court of Appeal’s decision in *Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Thanabalasingham* 2004 FCA 4 Online, is still considered a leading precedent on the approach to this question. " However, previous decisions to detain the individual must be considered at subsequent reviews and the Immigration Division must give **clear and compelling reasons for departing** from previous decisions."
    - Section **58(1)** of the IRPA provides that the **onus** to justify detention remains with the **Minister** at each subsequent review.
    - Supreme Court’s decision in *Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness) v Chhina* 2019 SCC 29 (CanLII), [Online](https://canlii.ca/t/j075t){:target="\_blank"}. Prior to the ruling in *Chhina*, the law was unclear as to whether provincial superior courts had the jurisdiction to hear applications for habeas corpus from immigration detainees, due to the existence of an alternative remedy under the IRPA. In its ruling in *Chhina*, the Supreme Court identified some important gaps in the IRPA’s detention review scheme, concluding that the scheme is not equally as broad and advantageous as *habeas corpus*.
    - What is a Security Certificate? The security certificate process within the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) is an immigration proceeding for the purpose of removing from Canada **non-Canadians** who are **inadmissible** for reasons of national security, violating human or international rights, or involvement in organized or serious crimes. **Only permanent residents or foreign nationals can be subject to a security certificate.**
    - How is an immigration security certificate procedure initiated and reviewed?
        - This alternative to the regular process is initiated by the **Minister** of IRCC and the **Minister** of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness when they exercise the authority granted by **s 77** of the IRPA and sign a security certificate.
        - Once signed, the certificate is **referred to a Federal Court** judge who must determine its reasonableness. The determination may be **appealed** to the Federal Court of Appeal only if the judge certifies that a serious question of general importance is involved.
        - A certificate that is determined to be reasonable is conclusive proof that the individual is inadmissible and is deemed to be a **removal** order that is in force (IRPA, s 80).
    - The process of removal:
        - begins with an officer’s **inadmissibility report** made under the authority of **s 44(1)** of the IRPA. This report (also known as a “**section 44(1) report**”) outlines **reasons** for concluding that the individual in question is inadmissible.
        - The report is forwarded to the **Minister’s delegate**, who must determine whether the report is **well-founded**.
        - Under **s 44(2)**, the Minister’s delegate may make a removal order in relation to permanent residents **only when** the ground of inadmissibility is a failure to meet the **residency requirements**.
        - In relation to foreign nationals, **s 228** of the IRPR specifies the straightforward cases where the Minister’s delegate may issue a **removal order**, including cases where the person has been convicted of a **criminal** offense in Canada, cases of **misrepresentation**, and cases where the individual has an **inadmissible family member**.
        - In all other cases, the Minister’s delegate may refer the matter to the IRB’s Immigration Division (ID) if he or she considers the report well-founded.
    - Removal orders may be issued either by the Minister’s delegate under IRPA, s 44(2), the ID under s 45(d), or the IAD under s 67(2).
        - **Section 228** applies only to foreign nationals and identifies the removal orders that the Minister’s delegate can issue without referral to the ID.
        - **Section 229** sets out the applicable removal orders to be made by the ID in relation to both foreign nationals and permanent residents.
    - **Sections 223 to 226** of the Regulations identify three types of removal order that may be issued:
        - **Departure Order**: a departure order requires that a person to leave Canada within 30 days, **confirming their departure** with the CBSA on exit from the country. If the person does not leave Canada within the 30 days, in nearly all cases the departure order will become a deportation order. (IRPR, s. 224)
        - **Exclusion Order**: an exclusion order requires that a person leave Canada, confirming their departure with the CBSA on exit from the country. Depending upon the reasons for which the exclusion order was issued, the person will be **barred** from making an application to return to Canada for one to five years. (IRPR, s. 225)
        - **Deportation Order**: a deportation order requires that a person leave Canada, confirming their departure with the CBSA, failing which the CBSA will arrange for their removal from Canada. If the person leaves Canada under a deportation order, they will **require** an Authorization to return to Canada (**ARC**) should they ever wish to return to Canada. (IRPR, s. 226)
    - Challenging a removal order:
        - The IAD’s powers in relation to removal orders are found in the IRPA, **ss 63-68**. Section 63 grants the right to **appeal** against the making of a removal order to a foreign national who holds a permanent resident visa, a permanent resident, or a protected person.
        - Where a decision has been made outside Canada that a permanent resident has not met the residency obligation, that decision may also be **appealed**.
        - for foreign nationals who have not been issued a permanent resident visa, **judicial review** in Federal Court is the only recourse to challenge the legality of a removal order.
        - The Minister may also appeal an ID decision not to make a removal order. The Minister’s appeal rights are broader than the individual: the Minister can appeal any ID decision in favour of the individual, even where the individual does not have a right of appeal (s 63(5))
    - When dealing with an appeal by a person under a removal order, the IAD is given three options. It may
        - (1) allow an appeal,
        - (2) stay the removal order and impose conditions, or
        - (3) dismiss the appeal.
    - **Section 67** provides the **grounds** for allowing the appeal:
        - (1) where the decision appealed is **wrong** in law, fact, or mixed law and fact;
        - (2) where a principle of **natural justice** has not been observed; or
        - (3) where, taking into account the **best interests of a child** directly affected by the decision, sufficient H&C considerations warrant special relief in light of all the circumstances of the case.
    - The IAD has developed a list of factors, called the **Ribic factors** (*Ribic v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)*, [1985] IABD No 4 (QL)), to be considered when determining whether the circumstances of the case justify such a decision.
    - Removal orders may also be stayed by the minister, by application for a **pre-removal risk assessment (PRAA)**, and by approval in principle for permanent residence on **H&C grounds** (review pp. 629-631 in Desloges and Sawicki, for details).

## Quizzes

??? note "6.1 Refugee Protection"

    1. One of the core principles of the Refugee Convention is **non-refoulement**, which means that:
        - [x] Persons must **not be returned** to a country where they face a risk of persecution
        - [ ] International law requires that no refugee claimants be returned to their country of origin
        - [x] Asylum seekers must be able to access a **fair process to adjudicate their claims** for protection
        - [x] A and C
        <br>non-refoulement is a rule of international law that obliges countries to provide protection to refugees against return to the country where they face a risk of persecution, or where their life or freedom would be threatened **unless an exclusion applies**. Countries are not obligated to provide protection to everyone who claims it, but they must provide a fair system to adjudicate claims for protection. See: Desloges & Sawicki, Chapter 11, s. III C "Principle of Non-Refoulement."

    2. Which of the following circumstance(s) could result in the cessation of protection for a Convention refugee who has been granted protection in Canada?
        - [x] The Convention refugee is residing permanently in another country, which offers him protection
        - [x] The Convention refugee has returned to their country of origin
        - [x] The Convention refugee has reacquired the nationality of their country of origin
        - [x] All of the above
        <br>A Convention refugee returning to their country of origin may be at risk of having cessation invoked against them provided that their actions are voluntary and intentional, and not accidental or occasional. Convention refugees who have obtained refugee protection in another country of residence or have reacquired their nationality, are more likely to be subject to cessation proceedings in Canada, even when they are already Canadian permanent residents. See: Desloges & Sawicki, Chapter 11, s. III E "Definition of a Convention Refugee: Cessation of Protection."

    3. True or false: A refugee claimant can be detained and their claim rejected if they entered Canada using forged identity documents.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>False. Article 31 of the 1951 Convention Relating to the Status of Refugees states that refugees should not be penalized for entering a country illegally if they have come directly from a place where they were in danger and have made themselves known to the authorities. Canadian courts have upheld this international law principle. See: Desloges & Sawicki, Chapter 11, s. II "Refugees."

    4. A person may be in need of protection from a risk of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. Which of the following would a member of the Refugee Protection Division consider in making this determination?
        - [x] Whether the punishment is arbitrarily imposed
        - [x] Whether the punishment goes beyond what is necessary to achieve a legitimate penal aim
        - [x] Whether the punishment is unacceptable to a large segment of the population, or shocks the conscience
        - [x] Whether the punishment is unconnected to the penal goals of retribution, rehabilitation, or deterrence
        - [x] All of the above
        <br>The Supreme Court of Canada has commented on the meaning of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment and has set out criteria in the criminal context:
            - 1) is the punishment beyond what is necessary to achieve a legitimate penal aim,
            - 2) is it unnecessary because there are adequate alternatives,
            - 3) is it unacceptable to a large segment of the population,
            - 4) is it not upon a rational basis in accordance with ascertained or ascertainable standards,
            - 5) is it arbitrarily imposed,
            - 6) is there no value in the sense of social purpose such as reformation, rehabilitation, deterrence, or retribution,
            - 7) is it in accordance with public standards of decency or propriety,
            - 8) will the punishment shock general conscience or intolerable in fundamental fairness, and
            - 9) is it unusually severe and hence degrading to human dignity and worth? See: Desloges & Sawicki, Chapter 11, s. III G "Persons in Need of Protection."

    5. Amina fears persecution in her country of origin because she is performing academic research on family planning. The government has found that she has breached the morality laws in her country by promoting birth control for women in a way that is not permissible under the government's version of Islam. She faces criminal charges and a possible term of imprisonment. You advise Amina that she may have a nexus based on which of the following Convention grounds?
        - [ ] Political opinion
        - [ ] Religion
        - [ ] Membership in a particular social group
        - [ ] All of the above
        <br>The five grounds of persecution are: race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, and political opinion. **Claimants may have more than one nexus to a Convention ground.** See: Desloges & Sawicki, Chapter 11, s. III E "Definition of a Convention Refugee."

    6. Which of the following is true about the decision-maker's assessment of the evidence in support of a refugee claim?
        - [x] The claimant's sworn testimony is presumed to be true, unless there are valid reasons to doubt their credibility
        - [ ] The claimant must provide corroborating documentary evidence
        - [ ] The claimant must prove each element of their claim on a balance of probabilities
        - [ ] None of the above
        <br>The burden of proof lies with the refugee claimant to substantiate statements with evidence. The evidence can be in oral form (the claimant's testimony under oath) or documentary form. The UNHCR points out that refugee claimants who flee persecution may have little or no personal documentation. **If the claimant's statement's statements appear credible, the claimant should be given the benefit of the doubt.** Canadian courts have upheld this principle in stating that unless there are valid reasons to question a claimant's credibility, **documentary evidence corroborating the claimant's allegations is not required.** A claimant should not be disbelieved solely because he/she cannot present documents to confirm his/her testimony. See: Desloges & Sawicki, Chapter 11, s. III D "Burden of Proof."

    7. True or False: In *Ezokola v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, the Supreme Court of Canada held that for a finding of complicity in war crimes and crimes against humanity, it is sufficient to establish the claimant's membership in a group or organization that commits criminal offences.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>False: The Supreme Court held the opposite - that it is not enough for a claimant to simply belong to a group that commits criminal offences; it is necessary for the claimant to voluntarily and knowingly make a significant contribution to those crimes. See: Desloges & Sawicki, Chapter 11, s. III E "Definition of a Convention Refugee: War Crimes and Crimes Against Humanity."

    8. You are assisting a client with her Convention refugee claim. In preparing documents to establish your client's subjective fear of persecution, which of the following can be used?
        - [x] Medical or psychological reports
        - [x] Written and verbal statements
        - [x] The client's sworn testimony
        - [x] All of the above
        <br>To support the subjective basis for a refugee claim, the claimant may submit documentary evidence such as medical or psychological reports. The claimant's written and verbal statement that provide insight into their state of mind is also acceptable. See: Desloges & Sawicki, Chapter 11, s. III E "Definition of a Convention Refugee: Well-Founded Fear."

    9. Which of the following are true about the **role played by International Human Rights Conventions** in Canada's refugee determination system?
        - [x] The IRPA significantly **broadened** the scope of refugee protection beyond the definition of a Convention refugee
        - [ ] Protection is available when derogable rights are suspended under a state of emergency
        - [x] We look to international conventions, such as the International Covenant on Civil & Political Rights, to determine what rights are non-derogable and deserving of protection
        - [ ] A risk of torture as defined by the Convention Against Torture will not by itself give rise to a valid claim for protection
        - [x] A & C
        <br>The IRPA significantly **broadened** the scope of refugee protection beyond the definition of a Convention refugee, and brought the Canadian law more in line with international human rights conventions. Derogable rights may be limited in states of emergency, but not non-derogable rights such as the right to life and the right to be free from torture or cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. See: Desloges & Sawicki, Chapter 11, s. III F "Human Rights Conventions."

    10. True or False: In order to establish a successful refugee claim, the claimant must prove on a balance of probabilities that they will be persecuted if returned to their country of origin.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>False. Claimants must establish the facts of their case on a balance of probabilities, but they **do not have to prove** that their persecution is more likely than not. Instead, they have to demonstrate that there are good grounds or a serious chance that persecution will occur. See: Desloges & Sawicki, Chapter 11, s. III E "Definition of a Convention Refugee: Well-Founded Fear."

    11. Which of the following are true about the definition of a Convention refugee?
        - [ ] A refugee has a **well-founded fear** of persecution
        - [ ] A refugee must demonstrate a **nexus** to a Convention ground
        - [ ] A refugee fears **persecution**, which is a serious deprivation of a fundamental human right
        - [x] All of the above
        <br>All of these are true about the definition of a Convention refugee. See: Desloges & Sawicki, Chapter 11, s. I "Introduction", and s. III E "Definition of a Convention Refugee."

    12. In determining whether a refugee has "re-availed" themselves of the protection of their country of nationality, the courts will consider which of the following?
        - [ ] Whether the refugee made the decision voluntarily
        - [ ] Whether the refugee had the intention to re-avail themselves
        - [ ] Whether their decision was coerced
        - [x] All of the above
        <br>In *Nsende v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)*, the court adopted the **three** requirements under the Convention as part of its analysis: **voluntariness** (the refugee acted voluntarily), **intention** (the refugee intended by his action to re-avail himself of the protection of the country of his nationality), **re-availment** (the refugee must actually obtain such protection). See: Desloges & Sawicki, Chapter 11, s. III E "Definition of a Convention Refugee: Cessation of Protection."

    13. Section 97 of IRPA provides protection to "persons in need of protection" who do not fit the definition of a Convention refugee. Which of the following would constitute a person in need of protection?
        - [x] A person who is facing a risk of detention and torture for criticizing government corruption
        - [ ] A person who is subject to risk of death or torture from a local gang
        - [ ] A person who has a serious illness and who cannot receive treatment from their country's health care system
        - [ ] A person who is facing a lengthy sentence for drug trafficking in their country of origin
        <br>==Section 97 of IRPA== sets out the definition of "person in need of protection". **The risk of danger must be at the hands of a state agent or it must be established that the state protection is not available.** The risk **cannot be caused by the inability of that country to provide adequate health or medical care, or from ordinary criminal activities**. The risk **cannot be due to a lawful sanctions**. See: Desloges & Sawicki, Chapter 11, s. III G "Persons in Need of Protection."

    14. True or false: When determining whether a refugee claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution, the subjective views of the claimant are less important than the objective considerations.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>False. The assessment of well-founded fear has both an **objective and subjective** component, but **one is not more important than the other**. The objective component considers if the fear is reasonable in the circumstances and considers the circumstances in which the fear arises. The subjective component considers the personal perspective of the claimant. See: Desloges & Sawicki, Chapter 11, s. III E "Definition of a Convention Refugee: Well-Founded Fear."

    15. A refugee claimant owes $50,000 to a loan shark in his home country. He fears for his life because he is not able to pay the loan back. He does not want to go to the police in his country because they are frequently corrupt. Which of the following is true about this claimant's nexus to a Convention ground?
        - [ ] He has a nexus based on political opinion
        - [ ] He has a nexus based on religious beliefs
        - [ ] He has a nexus based on membership in a particular social group
        - [x] None of the above
        <br>The five grounds of persecution are: **race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group, and political opinion**. If the persecution feared is not based on any of the enumerated grounds, then the individual is not a Convention refugee. Victims of ordinary crime do not fit the definition of a Convention refugee. Victims of some types of crimes may be able to claim persecution based on membership in a particular social group only if they can show a lack of state protection, such as victims of domestic violence, or victims of ethnic violence. Further, claims based on credible and individualized threats may be able to satisfy the requirements for protection pursuant to s. 97 of the IRPA (provided that all the elements of s. 97(1)(b) are met) as the risk is not indiscriminate or random. See: Desloges & Sawicki, Chapter 11, s. III E "Definition of a Convention Refugee" and s. III G "Persons in Need of Protection."

    16. In determining whether a refugee claimant has a well-founded fear, the Refugee Protection Division will assess:
        - [ ] Whether the claimant actually experiences fear
        - [ ] Whether the fear experienced by the claimant is reasonable in the circumstances
        - [ ] Whether there is safe haven inside the country of nationality where the claimant can seek protection
        - [x] All of the above
        <br>The assessment of well-founded fear has both an objective and subjective component. The objective component considers if the fear is reasonable in the circumstances and considers the circumstances in which the fear arises. The subjective component considers the personal perspective of the claimant. **As part of the ==objective component==, the refugee claimant may be required to show that there is no safe haven inside the country of nationality (internal flight alternative/IFA)**. See: Desloges & Sawicki, Chapter 11, s. III E "Definition of a Convention Refugee."

        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>False, there is a complex system of **annual quotas for SAHs**, which dictates how many refugees can be sponsored by each organization. See: Desloges & Sawicki, Chapter 12, s. VIII "Sponsorship Agreement Holders and Their Constituent Groups."

    8. Refugee applicants are assessed on the basis of their ability to become self-sufficient within 12 months of arrival in Canada. Which of the following is not a consideration in this assessment?

See: Desloges & Sawicki, Chapter 12, s. VII C "Selection and Admissibility Interview."

    9. The Refugee and Humanitarian Resettlement Program applies to which of the following persons?
        - [ ] Refugee claimants with claims pending before the Refugee Protection Division in Canada
        - [ ] Refugees inside Canada whose claims have been accepted
        - [ ] Convention refugees who are outside Canada
        - [ ] All of the above
        <br>The Refugee and Humanitarian **Resettlement** Program **applies only to those refugees located outside Canada**, including, but not limited to, those who have sought temporary refuge in camps across the border from their war-torn countries. This Program does not apply to refugee claimants seeking status determination while already inside Canada. See: Desloges & Sawicki, Chapter 12, s. 1 "Introduction."

    10. Which applicant would **not** qualify as a person in urgent need of protection:
        - [x] A member of the country of asylum class who is likely to be subject to imprisonment for an ordinary criminal offence

        - [ ] All of the above
        <br>Canadian officials from missions abroad work with UNHCR and various non-governmental organizations to identify refugees who are in need of resettlement. See: Desloges & Sawicki, Chapter 12, s. 1 "Introduction."

    12. True or false: All refugee applicants and their dependents **must pass a medical examination** to ensure they have no medical condition that is likely to be a danger to Canadian public health or safety.
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False

    13. Privately sponsored refugees typically have better rates of integration and economic outcomes than government-assisted refugees because:
        - [ ] the duration of private sponsorship undertakings is 36 months in contrast to the 12-month Government-Assisted Refugee program
        - [ ] privately sponsored refugees are subjected to more rigorous selection factors
        - [x] private sponsors are dedicated to helping refugees succeed and typically extend assistance beyond the formal requirements of the sponsorship undertaking
        - [ ] None of the above
        <br>"Privately sponsored refugees often have relatives already in Canada and are welcomed to Canada by a group of civic-minded sponsors dedicated to helping them succeed, where as government-assisted refugees are left to the mercy of settlement organizations and publicly available programs." See: Desloges & Sawicki, Chapter 12, s. VIII "Private Sponsorship Programs."

        - [ ] Each member is a **Canadian citizen or permanent resident**
        - [ ] Each member is **not in default** of any other sponsorship undertaking
        <br>G5 members are usually one-time sponsors who get together to respond to a special situation. There is no requirement for prior experience with refugee sponsorship. See: Desloges & Sawicki, Chapter 12, s. VIII "Group of Five."

    15. As part of Canada's refugee resettlement program, private sponsors enter into an undertaking with the Canadian government, where they agree to be responsible for:

        <br>Private sponsors enter into an undertaking with the Canadian government, where they agree to be responsible for income support and medical costs for the refugee(s) for one year after the arrival of the refugee(s). Besides their legal obligations under the undertaking, sponsors also help the families adjust to their new community. See: Desloges & Sawicki, Chapter 12, s. VIII "Private Sponsorship Programs."

    16. True or false: In contrast to refugee claimants undergoing refugee status determination at the RPD in Canada, applicants for refugee resettlement do **not** need to prove that they satisfy all elements of the refugee definition.

        <br>False. In order for an application for **resettlement** to be approved, the onus is on the claimant to prove that they **satisfy all elements of the Convention refugee definition**. See: Desloges & Sawicki, Chapter 12, s. VII "Application Requirements for Refugee Resettlement."

??? note "6.1 Chapter 9 of Cochran's Interviewing Skills"

    1. True or False: The **five principles** of an effective trauma-informed approach are: safety, choice, collaboration, transparency, and empowerment.
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False
        <br>Cochran outlines on p. 207 the five principles that underly an effective trauma-informed approach are **safety**, **choice**, **collaboration**, **transparency**, and **empowerment**

    2. You are interviewing a client who has just provided you with a detailed account of their imprisonment and torture in their country of origin. A trauma-informed way to respond would be to:
        - [ ] Demonstrate your sympathy by sharing your own story of a motor vehicle stop by police and being issued a ticket
        - [ ] Quickly move on to another topic to take your client's mind off their own traumatic experience
        - [x] Offer support and acknowledgement, and a check-in with the client on how they feel
        - [ ] Terminate the interview to avoid re-traumatization.
        <br>Disclosing trauma is an intimate and vulnerable action; check in with the client and see if they need any extra support (p. 216)

    3. True or False:  Vicarious trauma can have **long-term impacts** on people who have witnessed or heard about traumatic events.
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False
        <br>Vicarious trauma is the emotional residue from hearing trauma stories and witnessing the pain experienced by another person. Vicarious trauma can have long term impacts on individuals including withdrawal, frequently feeling angry or agitated, inability to focus, etc. (p. 222).

    4. What is the most effective strategy to create a safe interview environment with a client who has experienced trauma?
        - [ ] Have a structured interview with a series of narrow and directed questions
        - [ ] Minimize the options you give the client, so they do not have to make any choices
        - [x] Offer words encouragement, exercise extra caution around disclosures, and take breaks
        - [ ] Meet the client in a formal setting in order to appreciate the importance of the interview
        <br>Cochran offers a range of strategies and practical tips for creating a safe interview environment. See pp. 213-216.

    5. True or False: A trauma-informed approach to interviewing can help minimize re-traumatization and empower clients who have shared their stories.
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False
        <br>Applying a trauma-informed approach to interviews can create a **psychologically safe process** for both the interviewer and the client, while obtaining better interview results (pp. 196-199).

    6. True or False: A trauma-informed approach will eliminate any harms experienced by the trauma survivor and associated interference with the interviewing process.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>Trauma-informed approaches can only **minimize, not eliminate**, harm to trauma survivors (p. 207)

    7. True or False: The way that individuals respond to trauma and traumatic events are typically predictable and consistent.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>While there are many common themes in how individuals react and cope with trauma, everyone's response to trauma is individual and unique (p. 195).

    8. What role do **coping mechanisms** play in relation to trauma?
        - [ ] they mimic the trauma to desensitize traumatic events in incremental stages
        - [x] they protect trauma survivors from experiencing and re-experiencing their pain
        - [ ] they trigger trauma survivors to relive their experiences
        - [ ] they allow the manifestation of re-traumatization
        <br>Coping mechanisms are normal responses to trauma and are the way that the human body and brain **protects itself from suffering harm** (p. 200).

    9. Which of the following statements should **NOT** be a significant challenge when interviewing a client who has experienced traumatic events:
        - [ ] The client may be re-traumatized in the interview process
        - [ ] The client may not be able to provide all the necessary information
        - [ ] The person conducting the interview may experience distress hearing the details of the traumatic events
        - [x] The client might disclose personal and confidential information
        <br>Interviewing clients who have experienced trauma is challenging for both the client and the interviewer. If the interview is not conducted with sensitivity to the impact of trauma, it could derail the interview process, re-traumatize the client, and could potentially expose the interviewer to vicarious trauma (p. 195).

    10. Anna is survivor of domestic violence and is currently separated from her spouse. Anna was sponsored as a permanent resident by her abusive spouse and is seeking your advice on her immigration status now that they are separated.  In the interview, Anna starts out well, but becomes incoherent when it comes to discussing the details of her relationship. When you ask a question about how long she was married, she begins to describe the decorations and bridesmaid dresses at her wedding.  When you ask her for details about the separation, she begins to describe her new neighborhood she is currently living in. Which of the following responses to trauma do you recognize in Anna's example:
        - [x] **Non-linear** narratives
        - [ ] Patchy Memories
        - [ ] Denial
        - [ ] Emotional Swings
        <br>A typical response to trauma may be that a client **skips from one topic to another** rather quickly. In these cases, Cochran suggests gently guiding the client back to the topic or suggest taking a break.

The initial review must be within 48 hours of the person's detention. The second review must be during the seven days following the first review. Subsequent reviews must be conducted at least once during each 30-day period following the previous review. See Desloges & Sawicki, "Timing of Detention Reviews" on page 618.

    7. The prescribed factors that must be considered when determining whether to detain a person do not include:
        - [ ] Flight risk
        - [ ] Identity not established
        - [x] Whether they intend to seek asylum
        - [ ] Danger to the public
        <br>The factors are set out in the IRPR (s. 244), in the following four categories: **flight risk, danger the public, identity not established**, and other factors. See Desloges & Sawicki, "Factors that Affect Detention" at pp. 620-622.

    8. Which of the following must the CBSA carry out before the execution of a removal order?

        - confirm their **identity**;
        - obtain their **travel documents**; and
        - issue an immigration **warrant** for their arrest and detention if the person fails to appear for removal.
        <br>See Desloges & Sawicki, "Timelines for Removal" at pp. 631-632.

    9. True or false: At an admissibility hearing, the onus is always on the officer to prove that the person is inadmissible.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>False, if the person has **no legal status** in Canada, then the onus is on that person to prove that they are not inadmissible. If the person has **legal status**, then the onus is on the hearing officer to prove that the person became inadmissible at a later time. See" Desloges & Sawicki, Chapter 14, s. III "Inadmissibility Reports: Onus of Proof."

    10. True or false: The only basis upon which a person may be detained as a "danger to the public" is that they have been convicted of a serious crime inside or outside of Canada for which a sentence of 10 years or more could be imposed.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>False: **Criminal convictions are only one basis** upon which a person may be detained as a danger to the public; other reasons include: that the person is inadmissible on grounds of security, violating human or international rights; that the person is associated with a criminal organization; or that the person concerned has engaged in people smuggling or human trafficking. See Desloges & Sawicki, "Danger to the Public", p. 621.

    11. Immigration detainees can challenge the legality of their detention without mounting a collateral attack on the underlying immigration decision in situations that amount to "indefinite detention". This challenge is called:
        - [ ] *Locus standi*
        - [ ] *Caveat emptor*
        - [x] *Habeas corpus*
        - [ ] *Contra proferentem*
        <br>In *Chaudhary v Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness)*, 2015 ONCA 700, the Ontario Court of Appeal ruled that immigration detainees can apply to the Superior Court of Justice for *habeas corpus* to challenge their incarceration in situations that amount to "indefinite detention" under the Charter. If one is challenging the legality of the detention, and not simply mounting a collateral attack on an underlying immigration decision, this may be an option for detained clients. See Desloges & Sawicki, "Timing of Detention Reviews" on page 618.

    12. True or false: The minister has unlimited discretion to stay any removal order where the person would be sent to a country engaged in armed conflict, or where there is a serious environmental disaster, or another situation that poses a risk to the civilian population there.
