# Week 2: Notes and Quizzes

## Notes

???+ note "2.1.1 The Parts of a Decided Case"

      - **Style of Cause:**
        - The style of cause shows the names of the parties to the legal dispute - e.g. *R v Desautel* or *Kanthasamy v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*.
        - In a civil case the plaintiff or "initiator" is named first; in criminal cases the "R" representing Rex or Regina for King or Queen (i.e. the Crown) comes first.
        - The style of cause is always *italicized* when you are citing or referring to the case.
        - Do not include a period after the "v"
      - **Preliminary information:**
        - a collective term that refers to everything found between the style of cause and the beginning of the decision (judgment).
        - It includes the **court name**, the **judge(s)** who heard the case, the **date** the decision was published, **citations** for the case (derived from where the case was published) and the **names of the lawyers** who argued the case on behalf of each party.
        - The term "preliminary information" can also extend to other elements identified by their own names, like the **catchwords**, or **headnote**, depending on whether these are included with the case.
      - **Catch words or Catchlines:**
        - Catchlines are key phrases and key words separated by dashes that describe the legal issues decided in the case, as well as provide a very brief description of the facts of the case reported.
        - In many cases, both catchlines and headnotes, below, are written by legal editors - not by the court itself.
      - **Headnote:**
        - This is a summary of the facts, issues, and reasons for the decision rendered.
        - The headnote is not part of the court's official decision. It written by legal editors (or in the case of the Supreme Court, members of the communications staff).
      - **Authorities Referred To:**
        - The cases, statutes and sometimes any secondary sources cited and relied upon by the court in its decision are listed next.
        - But keep in mind that if you are reading an older case, the authorities relied upon may no longer be the most recent law.
      - **History of the Case:** If this is not the first hearing of the case, the prior history of the case will be given.
      - **Decision(s):**
        - Sometimes also called the "judgement". This is the essential core of the case: the written reasons of the judge(s) who heard the case and rendered a legal determination on it.
        - As you read the decision, look for four important features that you will need for your case brief:
            - <i class="fa-solid fa-1 number"></i> the **Holding**, which is the **substantive outcome** of the case - this may either be set out at the start of the decision, at the end, or both. You might compare this to the **Disposition**, which is simply the **procedural outcome** (appeal allowed, etc) and which usually appears in the headnote;
            - <i class="fa-solid fa-2 number"></i> the **legal Issue(s)** - in other words, the **legal question(s)** that the court answers in its decision;
            - <i class="fa-solid fa-3 number"></i> the **legal Rule(s)** (in other words, the **law**) that the court relied on in its judgement, which could be derived from legislation, case law, and/or government policy;
            - <i class="fa-solid fa-4 number"></i> the court's **Reasoning**, in other words, the paragraphs in which the court **applies the law** to the legally relevant facts of the case in order to answer the question(s) posed in the issue.
