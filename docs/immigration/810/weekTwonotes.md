# Week 2: Notes and Quizzes

## Notes

??? note "2.1.1 The Parts of a Decided Case"

      - **Style of Cause:**
        - The style of cause shows the names of the parties to the legal dispute - e.g. *R v Desautel* or *Kanthasamy v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*.
        - In a civil case the plaintiff or "initiator" is named first; in criminal cases the "R" representing Rex or Regina for King or Queen (i.e. the Crown) comes first.
        - The style of cause is always *italicized* when you are citing or referring to the case.
        - Do not include a period after the "v"
      - **Preliminary information:**
        - a collective term that refers to everything found between the style of cause and the beginning of the decision (judgment).
        - It includes the **court name**, the **judge(s)** who heard the case, the **date** the decision was published, **citations** for the case (derived from where the case was published) and the **names of the lawyers** who argued the case on behalf of each party.
        - The term "preliminary information" can also extend to other elements identified by their own names, like the **catchwords**, or **headnote**, depending on whether these are included with the case.
      - **Catch words or Catchlines:**
        - Catchlines are key phrases and key words separated by dashes that describe the legal issues decided in the case, as well as provide a very brief description of the facts of the case reported.
        - In many cases, both catchlines and headnotes, below, are written by legal editors - not by the court itself.
      - **Headnote:**
        - This is a summary of the facts, issues, and reasons for the decision rendered.
        - The headnote is not part of the court's official decision. It written by legal editors (or in the case of the Supreme Court, members of the communications staff).
      - **Authorities Referred To:**
        - The cases, statutes and sometimes any secondary sources cited and relied upon by the court in its decision are listed next.
        - But keep in mind that if you are reading an older case, the authorities relied upon may no longer be the most recent law.
      - **History of the Case:** If this is not the first hearing of the case, the prior history of the case will be given.
      - **Decision(s):**
        - Sometimes also called the "judgement". This is the essential core of the case: the written reasons of the judge(s) who heard the case and rendered a legal determination on it.
        - As you read the decision, look for four important features that you will need for your case brief:
            - <i class="fa-solid fa-1 number"></i> the **Holding**, which is the **substantive outcome** of the case - this may either be set out at the start of the decision, at the end, or both. You might compare this to the **Disposition**, which is simply the **procedural outcome** (appeal allowed, etc) and which usually appears in the headnote;
            - <i class="fa-solid fa-2 number"></i> the **legal Issue(s)** - in other words, the **legal question(s)** that the court answers in its decision;
            - <i class="fa-solid fa-3 number"></i> the **legal Rule(s)** (in other words, the **law**) that the court relied on in its judgement, which could be derived from legislation, case law, and/or government policy;
            - <i class="fa-solid fa-4 number"></i> the court's **Reasoning**, in other words, the paragraphs in which the court **applies the law** to the legally relevant facts of the case in order to answer the question(s) posed in the issue.

??? note "2.1.2 Key Concepts in Legislation"

    - The word legislation is an umbrella term. It refers to both statutes and regulations.
    - In order to receive Royal Assent and become law, a bill must pass through a number of stages, such as readings, debate, committee hearings and reports, and voting.  It must be approved in both chambers of Parliament: the Senate and the House of Commons.
    - An act may come into force in a number of ways:
        - Upon receiving Royal Assent, the approval by the constitutional monarch, or by their representative in Canada (the **Governor General**)
        - On a fixed date, either in the future (prospective) or in the past (retrospective- common with fiscal and tax legislation)
        - Upon Proclamation of the Governor in Council (the **Governor General**)

    - Once a federal statute has received Royal Assent, it is published in three places: in the [Canada Gazette](https://www.gazette.gc.ca/accueil-home-eng.html){:target="\_blank"}; in a printed annual volume called Statutes of Canada; and on the government's legislation website, which is called [Justice Laws](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/){:target="\_blank"}
    - Revision or consolidation of statutes is the process by which various amendments made over time are “edited in” or incorporated into the version of the act that you see on the government database. The current consolidated version of an act on Justice Laws reflects all changes made to that act between the date of its enactment up to the date of the most recent consolidation (the "currency date").
    - **FILAC** stands for: *Facts*, *Issues*, *Law* (or sometimes called Rule), *Application* (or sometimes called Analysis), and *Conclusion*. The first three steps are often described as iterative; these three elements are interwoven and interdependent.
    - The A step in FILAC may take several forms:
        - Reasoning by analogy: drawing an analogy between the two cases, comparing like to like.
        - Rules based reasoning: applying the legislation to your client's facts. You may also rely on rules extracted and synthesized from case law.
        - Policy-based reasoning: there may be serious policy issues that are raised by your client's file. This is especially true in an area of law like immigration and citizenship law, in which case you might argue that public policy objectives should be taken into account in any determination of your client's case.

???+ note "2.3 Legal Research"

    - Legal information is divided into two types: **primary sources**, which "give" the law; and **secondary sources**, which provide commentary on the law and point you to relevant primary sources.
    - There are two Canadian legal encyclopedias, and they are only accessible through the subscription services. On Westlaw, the encyclopedia is called the **Canadian Encyclopedic Digest (the CED)**. On Lexis, the encyclopedia is called **Halsbury's laws of Canada (Halsbury's)**. CanLII does not currently have a legal encyclopedia.
    - Many older federal and provincial statutes can now be accessed for free on the searchable [Internet Archive](https://archive.org/){:target="\_blank"}. You may wish to make a note of this in your text.  
    - Both subscription services now carry **tribunal decisions**, including decisions of the various sub-bodies of the **Immigration and Refugee Board of Canada** – as does CanLII. As you may know, you can also find some of these decisions on the IRB’s own website.
    - “case summaries and digests” are not, in fact, secondary sources – they are more often characterized as **"finding tools"**. An important point to remember: **case digest databases exist both in Westlaw and Lexis, but not in CanLII.**
    - **<span class="Coral">Noting up Statutes</span>**: **Finding case law that has interpreted the various provisions ofa statute is also a key component of statute Jaw research, and is referred to as noting-up.** Judicial consideration of the statute can be found using the noting-up features in databases such as WestlawNext Canada, LexisNexis Quicklaw, and CanLII.
    - **<span class="Coral">Noting-up Cases</span>**: Noting-up involves finding the history of a case and the subsequent cases that have considered the case you are noting-up.

??? note "2.3.1 The Vocabulary of Legal Research: A Short Glossary"

    - **Access point:** The online point from which you begin research in an electronic environment, usually a specific web URL. Access points include, but are not limited to, a service, a web page, or a search engine.
    - **Citator tool:** A citator tool is used to identify cases and secondary sources that have cited your target resource, whether that is case law or legislation. These citing references are important, because they help you to assess the quality (that is, the strength, relevance or authoritativeness) of your target resource. A citator tool is essential for noting up (or updating) case law and legislation. On CanLII, the citator tool is called RefLex. It is accessed through the “Noteup/Discussion” box on the landing page. Westlaw and Lexis also have citator tools, called KeyCite and QuickCite respectively.
    - **Click-path notation**: A way of recording for yourself or for someone else the series of steps or "clicks" you perform when searching for legal information in an electronic environment. A click path should identify essential elements of your searching such as: the date your searched; the access point (where you started from); any sub-databases or tools that you then navigated to; and any specific search techniques you used (like filtering) or search strings with connectors that you used.  
    - **Database**: A collection of digital information stored electronically and organized in such a way that information can be searched on various dimensions. CanLII, as well as Westlaw and Lexis each contain dozens of legal information databases.
    - **Digest**: A digest is a short summary of a single decided issue in a case. Note that it is not a summary of a case as a whole. Since some cases result in a number of decided legal issues, one such case may give rise to more than one digest. Digests are written by legal editors employed by the subscription services Westlaw and Lexis, where they are collected into searchable databases (see below). **CanLII doesn't have digests and nor does it have a digest database.**
    - **Digest database**: A collection of digests organized by legal topic, found in either of the subscription databases (Westlaw or Lexis) but not in CanLII. Each digest is assigned a classification in the topical scheme. All digests related to a single legal issue are stored together. Once you find the classification for your legal issue, you can find all digests related to that issue.  The Canadian Abridgment Digests are found on Westlaw. The Canada Digest is found on Lexis.
    - **Disintermediation**: In legal research, disintermediation is a recent phenomenon whereby large amounts of information are available directly from an author to a legal consumer of information. There is no "middle-man" - in other words, this is information supplied without any guidance in locating or interpreting that information, or editorial vetting of the resource, as might be provided by a legal information management expert (law librarian) or an editorial team including peer reviewers.
    - **Legal Encyclopedia**: A legal encyclopedia is a specialized authoritative traditional secondary source. A legal encyclopedia article on your topic will orient you to the law and also point you to the relevant primary sources (legislation and case law) relevant to that topic. Content is organized by topic and the table of contents can be browsed or keyword searched.  New content is added regularly. There are two legal encyclopedias in Canada. Both are accessed online through the subscription services. **The Canadian Encyclopedic Digest (CED) is found on Westlaw; Halsbury’s Laws of Canada is found on Lexis. CanLII does not have a legal encyclopedia.**
    - **Research checklist**: A research checklist provides a framework to support the process of legal research. It is designed to ensure that your research is systematic and organized and that you don't miss any resources. You can also use a checklist to record your searches, so as to be able to refer to them in the future. This helps you to avoid replicating searches you have already done. It is also a convenient means of communicating to someone else the searches you performed.
    - **Research strategy**: The combination of tools and techniques which together form a systematic approach for locating and retrieving legal information for problem-solving.
    - **Resource**: (Sometimes just called a “source”.) Legal information of a particular type, presented in a specific format, identifiable by a citation. In legal research, sources are classified as either primary (legislation and case law) or secondary (legal commentary whether in traditional or non traditional formats).
    - **Search** engine: A software application powered by an algorithm enabling users to search for information held in larger repositories, like on the World Wide Web. The term is sometimes conflated with the idea of a web browser, which is also a software application but which is stored locally on a user’s computer. For example, Alphabet Inc.’s proprietary browser is called Chrome; its search engine is called Google. A search engine selects and returns results based not only on the search terms entered by the user, but also based on other selection criteria built into the algorithm, which are usually not known to the user.
    - **Service**: A collection of research tools and databases available from a single access point. In legal research, a service provides a wide range of primary and secondary legal information and may also offer additional value-added elements, like annotations, classification schemes or commentary, as well as useful tools or integrated functionality to facilitate searching. CanLII is a free service. Westlaw and Lexis are also services and are both subscription-based (fee-based).
    - **Technique**: Any observable information-seeking behaviour. In an electronic research environment, a search technique involves the use of a computer. Techniques can be used alone or in combination, and tailored for the specific information seeking goals of the researcher. Keyword searching is an example of a search technique.
    - **Tool**: A broad term referring to anything you use in support of information-seeking for legal problem solving. An example of a research tool is a citator.

## Quizzes

??? note "2.3 Legal Research Concepts Review"

    1. Given the characteristics of secondary sources, you should only use them at the end of your research and reasoning process.
          - [ ] True
          - [x] False

    2. Often, the best approach to case law research is to begin with a secondary source.
          - [x] True
          - [ ] False
    <br>**Many researchers jump right into keyword searches when looking for decided cases on a legal issue - and so you might think that this statement is false. But keyword searching is a difficult technique to perfect. If you are not expert at the use of Boolean connectors, your results list may contain too many results to review easily, many of which are irrelevant to your needs. It is always best to begin your research by using a reliable secondary source, which will point you to relevant cases. By using a secondary source, you are leveraging the "legwork" that the author has already done for you in identifying leading cases that are on-topic.**

    3. Noting up is a mandatory step in legal research.
          - [x] True
          - [ ] False
    <br>***Noting up primary law - whether case law or legislation* - is never an optional technique. Review the noting up segments found in ICL810 for both case law and legislation.**

    4. CanLII Connects is a legal encyclopedia.
          - [ ] True
          - [x] False
    <br>**Although CanLII has some excellent features, one feature it currently lacks is an encyclopedia (like the Canadian Encyclopedic Digest on Westlaw and Halsbury's Laws of Canada on Lexis). CanLII Connects offers interesting commentary, but this is more like a non-traditional secondary source than an encyclopedia.  CanLII, however, is always improving and making strides in developing the tools it offers. Before long, we may see an encyclopedia on CanLII, too.**

    5. Legal research and reasoning are iterative rather than linear.
          - [x] True
          - [ ] False

    6. In researching an issue where you know little about the law, you should consult resources in the following order:
          - [ ] Legislation, case law, secondary sources
          - [ ] Case law, legislation, secondary sources
          - [x] Secondary sources, legislation, case law
          - [ ] Case law, secondary sources, legislation
    <br>**In the early stages of your practice, you may encounter areas of immigration law that are less familiar.  Because of their two-fold function, secondary sources should always be your first approach when you are dealing with an area of law that you know little about. Secondary Sources give you an overview of the law, and they point you to significant primary sources. This is also true if you do know something about the law, but need to be reminded or reoriented as to the central concepts, leading cases, and relevant legislation that are essential to legal problem solving in a specific topic area.**

    7. Which of the following is a 2y keyword under the 1y classification "Immigration and Citizenship Law"?
          - [ ] Extended family
          - [x] Family class immigration
          - [ ] "friends and family"
          - [ ] Family law

    8. Which of the following constitutes the highest case law authority for any given proposition in law?
          - [ ] An IRB decision
          - [x] A Federal Court of Appeal decision.
          - [ ] A tribunal decision.
          - [ ] An immigration officer's decision.

    9. Which of the following statements is true?
          1. Keyword+Boolean searching is the most important search technique in legal research.
          2. In generating keywords for searching, you may need to generate a number of synonyms as well.
          - [ ] Statement 1 is true.
          - [ ] Both statements are true.
          - [x] Statement 2 is true.
          - [ ] Neither statement is true.
    <br>---
    <br>The first statement is false. While keyword + Boolean searching is an important technique, **there are other techniques that may be more efficient**, depending on what you are researching. Keyword + Boolean searching can be difficult to master, and can yield unexpected – and unexpectedly voluminous – results. Its value depends greatly on your mastery of the technique. It's important to leverage other options, like using secondary sources which can point you to primary sources, or using a leading case to finding other cases on point, or noting up a legislative provision to find cases that interpret that provision.
    <br>The second statement is true. One of the reasons a keyword+Boolean technique can be difficult to master is that you are asking the search algorithm to simply return matches of a keyword. If the concept you are researching – like drunk driving, for example – can be expressed in different ways ("DWI", "DUI", "driving under the influence", "driving while intoxicated", etc.), then you will need to use all of these search terms in your search, since you can't predict which terms a court will use in referring to that concept.

    10. You are trying to find relevant cases on a narrow legal issue, and you have no leads. You understand the area of law and the relevant legislative provision well, since these were covered in depth in one of your courses. You can accurately articulate the legal issue. You would like to search in CanLII. How should you begin your search?
          - [ ] Begin with a keyword+Boolean search over full text.
          - [ ] Begin with a digest database.
          - [ ] Begin with a subject-based search.
          - [x] Begin by noting up the legislation.
    <br>**All of the techniques here could be used, but <span class="Coral">an efficient approach is to note up the legislation and look for cases interpreting the legislation</span>. Recall that CanLII does not have a digest database. Similarly, while it is starting to organize cases by legal topic, the topic areas are broad not detailed. Finally, a keyword search over full text can lead to too many results, more than you can possibly review. there are factors that help you eliminate options.**

    11. When looking for relevant authorities in support of your submissions on behalf of a client, look for:
          - [ ] Cases from a high level of court that have not been reversed on appeal, and statutes with pending amendments.
          - [ ] Cases from any level of court so long as the facts are the same, and relevant regulations with pending amendments.
          - [ ] Decisions of the first instance from the IRB/IAD, legislation that is current, and any pending regulations.
          - [x] The most current official version of relevant legislation, and decisions with similar facts and issues to those of your client, preferably from the federal court or higher.
    <br>**In order for your submissions to be persuasive, they must be based on law that is current and authoritative. Ensure that you are using the most up-to-date version of any legislation (that is, legislation that has all recent amendments and repeals edited into the version you are looking at), whether statutes or regulations, and case law that triggers the principle of stare decisis and is binding precedent, insofar as possible, on the decision maker to whom you are making submissions. Be sure that you have also consulted relevant government policy, a rich source of information as to how the government believes the law should be applied.**

    12. Consider the following keyword + Boolean search string for case law: "best interests" and (child* /p (grand* OR mother)). What can you predict about the results of this search?
          - [ ] All cases in your results list will contain the word "children" within the same paragraph as the word "grandmother".
          - [ ] All cases in your results list will be primarily about immigration law.
          - [ ] All cases in your results list will contain the term "child" within 5 words of the phrase "best interests".
          - [x] All cases in your results list will contain the phrase "best interests"

    13. The chaining technique requires:
          - [ ] a Table of Authorities and Social Science Research Network (SSRN) or Google Scholar.
          - [ ] a citator tool and the citation block at the top of the full-text view.
          - [ ] a citator tool and a digest database.
          - [ ] a Table of Authorities and a citator tool.
    <br>**Chaining is a technique you can use to <span class="Coral">take one good case and parlay it into more good cases</span>. You begin with a good target case, one that is relevant to your analysis. <span class="Coral">Review the decision for cases that your target case has cited (look for a Table of Authorities or "Cases Cited")</span>; and <span class="Coral">cases that have cited your target case (citator tool results)</span>. This is essentially the "citator approach" in the One Good Case technique. A **digest database**, while good for the other approach in the One Good Case technique, does not depend on the web of citations for generating other cases on point - it uses a digest database classification system to do that. Note that the **citation block** at the top of the full text view of your target case indicates where you case has been published, not where it has been cited.**

    14. What is *stare decisis*?
          - [ ] A legal procedure whereby an applicant asks for a decision without a hearing.
          - [x] A principle that says cases having similar facts and that deal with the same legal issues should be decided the same way.
          - [ ] A principle that says legal fact similarity is less important than legal issue similarity.
          - [ ] An aspect of case law only found in court of appeal cases and higher.
    <br>***Stare decisis* is a Latin phrase that refers to the principle underlying the development of the common law. Cases that involve the same legal issue, have similar facts, and are subject to the same legal rules should be decided the same way. It is this principle which gives us the idea of precedent or "authority", which is why it's important in legal research. Stare decisis applies to decisions at all levels of court in a common law jurisdiction like Canada, but the degree to which any decision functions as a precedent will depend on the level of court that rendered the decision. It is becoming more common for the immigration tribunals to strive for a consistent body of law, but in general, cases decided by the Federal Court of Appeal or Supreme Court of Canada are considered to have the greatest authority.**

    15. What is filtering?
          - [ ] A technique for narrowly articulating a legal issue.
          - [x] A technique used to narrow the population of search results returned.
          - [ ] A technique in persuasive legal writing.
          - [ ] A technique for making a case brief more concise.
    <br>**Filtering is a basic search technique whereby you set parameters that your search results must meet (jurisdiction, level of court, date, etc.) in order to narrow a population of search results. You can filter search results on all three services.**

    16. CanLII is the preferred access point for retrieving consolidated legislation.
          - [ ] True
          - [x] False
    <br>**Although CanLII does maintain a database of legislation, the most current version of any federal act or regulation will be found on the government web site Justice Laws. Thus, <span class="Coral">Justice Laws</span> is the preferred access point.**

    17. We extract keywords only for the purpose of creating search strings.
          - [ ] True
          - [x] False
    <br>**It is true that keywords, when used together with Boolean connectors, are the building blocks of good search strings. **But keywords aren't just for search strings**; they serve other purposes in legal research. For example, in the early stages of your research, they help you conceptualize and articulate your client's legal issue as you cycle through the first few steps of the legal research checklist (identify the legally relevant facts; articulate the legal issues; retrieve and read relevant secondary sources). And they alert you to the organization of legal information for your topic, helping you name the specific legal issues in a sub-segment of immigration law so that you can zero in more effectively on relevant primary and secondary sources.**

    18. Legal research is hard because it is very difficult to find relevant information on various topics.
          - [ ] True
          - [x] False
    <br>**Many believe that finding the law is hard.  In fact, it has never been easier. There has never been such a large amount of legal information so widely available and so accessible.  However, the huge and ever-expanding volume of legal information can create its own challenges. **It is easy to become overwhelmed** by the amount of legal information you find in an online search, and as a result, to **become distracted and inefficient**. To remain on-task with your searches, remember to think carefully about your problem before you begin. Using the the FILAC framework early on in your research process can help you analyze your client's problem and alert you to the types of legal information that will be relevant, before you set out to look for the applicable law and commentary. Similarly, using a research checklist and tracking your searches can help you avoid duplicating your efforts.**

    19. The terms "source law" and "consolidated law" are not interchangeable.
          - [x] True
          - [ ] False
    <br>**These terms refer to two different points in the "life" of a piece of legislation:  <span class="Coral">the law as it appeared when it was first enacted – source law</span> – or the same law as it appears after <span class="Coral">any amendments to the law have been edited in to the text – consolidated statutes (sometimes also called revised statutes)</span>. These terms are not interchangeable. **The consolidated version of an act - that is, the version of the act that is most up-to-date - may be quite different in its text from the way the same act looked when it was first enacted.** This would be due to amendments made to that act since the time the act was first enacted. This is why it is important to check that you are using the most recent version of the act in your legal analysis.**

    20. Westlaw, Lexis and CanLII all have citator tools.
          - [x] True
          - [ ] False
    <br>**Each of the services has a citator tool, although the ones in the subscription databases offer more features and information when you are noting up and looking for judicial treatment.**

    21. An Act that amends IRPA  just received Royal Assent. This means that these amendments immediately apply to your client.
          - [ ] True
          - [x] False
    <br>**Although an act must receive Royal Assent in order to become law, it must also come into force before it applies to the public. **Amendments can come into force upon receiving Royal Assent, but they could also come into force on a date to be proclaimed, on a fixed date (past or future), or in any combination of these options.** Depending on your client's situation and timeline, you may still need to consider the amendments, but do not assume that they are in force just because the amending act has received Royal Assent. You must check specifically for coming into force information found in the amending act.**

    22. You are looking for cases that have interpreted and applied a section of an act. What is the optimal strategy?
          - [ ] Note up the section for judicial treatment.
          - [ ] Re-read your notes from the related GDipICL course.
          - [ ] Do a keyword search over full text case law database using the section number as a keyword.
          - [ ] Note up the section for currency.
    <br>**The task described is the second part of a note up for legislation, subsequent judicial treatment.  Use a citator tool to perform this task.  In CanLII, you can either use the note-up/discussion box, or navigate to the act in question, scroll to the right section, click on the call-out box to the right of the section, choose <span class="Coral">"Citing documents"</span> and then filter by cases.**
