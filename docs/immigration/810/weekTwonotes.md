# Week 2: Notes and Quizzes

## Notes

??? note "2.1.1 The Parts of a Decided Case"

      - **Style of Cause:**
        - The style of cause shows the names of the parties to the legal dispute - e.g. *R v Desautel* or *Kanthasamy v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*.
        - In a civil case the plaintiff or "initiator" is named first; in criminal cases the "R" representing Rex or Regina for King or Queen (i.e. the Crown) comes first.
        - The style of cause is always *italicized* when you are citing or referring to the case.
        - Do not include a period after the "v"
      - **Preliminary information:**
        - a collective term that refers to everything found between the style of cause and the beginning of the decision (judgment).
        - It includes the **court name**, the **judge(s)** who heard the case, the **date** the decision was published, **citations** for the case (derived from where the case was published) and the **names of the lawyers** who argued the case on behalf of each party.
        - The term "preliminary information" can also extend to other elements identified by their own names, like the **catchwords**, or **headnote**, depending on whether these are included with the case.
      - **Catch words or Catchlines:**
        - Catchlines are key phrases and key words separated by dashes that describe the legal issues decided in the case, as well as provide a very brief description of the facts of the case reported.
        - In many cases, both catchlines and headnotes, below, are written by legal editors - not by the court itself.
      - **Headnote:**
        - This is a summary of the facts, issues, and reasons for the decision rendered.
        - The headnote is not part of the court's official decision. It written by legal editors (or in the case of the Supreme Court, members of the communications staff).
      - **Authorities Referred To:**
        - The cases, statutes and sometimes any secondary sources cited and relied upon by the court in its decision are listed next.
        - But keep in mind that if you are reading an older case, the authorities relied upon may no longer be the most recent law.
      - **History of the Case:** If this is not the first hearing of the case, the prior history of the case will be given.
      - **Decision(s):**
        - Sometimes also called the "judgement". This is the essential core of the case: the written reasons of the judge(s) who heard the case and rendered a legal determination on it.
        - As you read the decision, look for four important features that you will need for your case brief:
            - <i class="fa-solid fa-1 number"></i> the **Holding**, which is the **substantive outcome** of the case - this may either be set out at the start of the decision, at the end, or both. You might compare this to the **Disposition**, which is simply the **procedural outcome** (appeal allowed, etc) and which usually appears in the headnote;
            - <i class="fa-solid fa-2 number"></i> the **legal Issue(s)** - in other words, the **legal question(s)** that the court answers in its decision;
            - <i class="fa-solid fa-3 number"></i> the **legal Rule(s)** (in other words, the **law**) that the court relied on in its judgement, which could be derived from legislation, case law, and/or government policy;
            - <i class="fa-solid fa-4 number"></i> the court's **Reasoning**, in other words, the paragraphs in which the court **applies the law** to the legally relevant facts of the case in order to answer the question(s) posed in the issue.

???+ note "2.1.2 Key Concepts in Legislation"

    - The word legislation is an umbrella term. It refers to both statutes and regulations.
    - In order to receive Royal Assent and become law, a bill must pass through a number of stages, such as readings, debate, committee hearings and reports, and voting.  It must be approved in both chambers of Parliament: the Senate and the House of Commons.
    - An act may come into force in a number of ways:
        - Upon receiving Royal Assent, the approval by the constitutional monarch, or by their representative in Canada (the **Governor General**)
        - On a fixed date, either in the future (prospective) or in the past (retrospective- common with fiscal and tax legislation)
        - Upon Proclamation of the Governor in Council (the **Governor General**)

    - Once a federal statute has received Royal Assent, it is published in three places: in the [Canada Gazette](https://www.gazette.gc.ca/accueil-home-eng.html){:target="\_blank"}; in a printed annual volume called Statutes of Canada; and on the government's legislation website, which is called [Justice Laws](https://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/){:target="\_blank"}
    - Revision or consolidation of statutes is the process by which various amendments made over time are “edited in” or incorporated into the version of the act that you see on the government database. The current consolidated version of an act on Justice Laws reflects all changes made to that act between the date of its enactment up to the date of the most recent consolidation (the "currency date").
    - **FILAC** stands for: *Facts*, *Issues*, *Law* (or sometimes called Rule), *Application* (or sometimes called Analysis), and *Conclusion*. The first three steps are often described as iterative; these three elements are interwoven and interdependent.
    - The A step in FILAC may take several forms:
        - Reasoning by analogy: drawing an analogy between the two cases, comparing like to like.
        - Rules based reasoning: applying the legislation to your client's facts. You may also rely on rules extracted and synthesized from case law.
        - Policy-based reasoning: there may be serious policy issues that are raised by your client's file. This is especially true in an area of law like immigration and citizenship law, in which case you might argue that public policy objectives should be taken into account in any determination of your client's case.
