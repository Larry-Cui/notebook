## Notes

??? note "4.1 Introduction to Entry and Admissibility"

    - **Foreign National (FN)** is a person who is not a Canadian Citizen or a Permanent Resident of Canada, and includes a stateless person. (s.2 IRPA)
    - **A Temporary Resident (TR)** is a foreign national who is authorized to enter and remain in Canada for a limited period. (s.22 IRPA)
    - **A Temporary Resident Visa (TRV)** allows a foreign national to enter Canada (admission to Canada). (s.180 IRPR)
    - **An Electronic Travel Authorization (eTA)** allows non-Visa required nationals to fly to Canada. (Note that there are exceptions, i.e. US Citizens.)
    - **A Visitor Record (VR)** is issued if, upon examination, an officer decides to permit a foreign national to remain in Canada. It is issued for a fixed period of time, at the discretion of the officer.
    - **A Permanent Resident** is a person who has submitted an application for permanent resident status and has officially been granted the status by an Officer. A PR is a person who has legally immigrated to Canada but is not yet a Canadian Citizen. (section 21(1) IRPA and s 46 IRPA)
    - 3 (1) The objectives of IRPA with respect to immigration are:
        - (c) to support the development of a strong and prosperous Canadian economy, in which the benefits of immigration are shared across all regions of Canada;
        - (g) to facilitate the entry of visitors, students and temporary workers for purposes such as trade, commerce, tourism, international understanding and cultural, educational and scientific activities;
        - (h) to protect public health and safety and to maintain the security of Canadian society;
        - (i) to promote international justice and security by fostering respect for human rights and by denying access to Canadian territory to persons who are criminals or security risks.
    - s.6 of the IRPR states that a “foreign national may not enter Canada to remain on a permanent basis without first obtaining **a permanent resident visa**."
    - A visitor record is issued either by the CBSA or IRCC. You need to apply for a visitor record when:
        - you first arrive at the port of entry and you know you want to stay longer than 6 months; or
        - you’re in Canada and decide you want to stay longer. You must apply at least **30 days before** your authorized stay in Canada expires.
    - Requirements for entry to Canada:
        - If a PR of Canada:
            - Valid passport and valid PR Card; or
            - Valid passport and valid permanent resident travel document approval from IRCC (if entering by air) or other documentation to demonstrate compliance with A28 if entering Canada by land
        - If a FN seeking entry to Canada:
            - Valid passport + valid eTA; or
            - Valid passport + TRV; or
            - If US Citizen, valid passport
    - **ONLY** FN is inadmissable because of:
        -  Criminality: IRPA 36(2)
        -  Health grounds: IRPA 38 (1)
        -  Financial reasons: IRPA 39
    - Consequences of **inadmissibility**:
        - Possible consequences for a **PR**:
            - A s.44(1) Report may be written, after which the person would need to appear before the Immigration Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB)
            - Depending upon the type of ”inadmissibility,” the person may have the right to appeal the decision to take away their PR status to the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) of the IRB
            - Possible loss of PR status in Canada
            - Possible removal from Canada and the requirement of special paperwork for return to Canada
        - Possible consequences for a **TR**:
            - If the person is in Canada, a s.44(1) Report may be written, after which the person would need to appear before the Immigration Division of the Immigration and Refugee Board (IRB)
                - Possible loss of TR status in Canada
                - Possible removal from Canada and the requirement of special paperwork for return to Canada
            - If the person is outside of Canada (or at the border), they would be denied entry to Canada and/or denied the necessary immigration documentation for entry to Canada
            - The person could request a Temporary Resident Permit or Rehabilitation (as applicable) to overcome the “inadmissibility”
        - What does the FN want to do if they are allowed to enter Canada?
            - **Visit**: then FN may be required to apply for and be granted a TRV or eTA before they request entry to Canada, unless they are a US citizen seeking to enter as a visitor
            - **Study**: then the FN must apply for and be granted a Study Permit before they request entry to Canada
            - **Work**: then the FN must apply for and be granted a Work Permit before they request entry to Canada

???+ note "4.2: Temporary entry"

    - IRPR regarding temporary resident status:
          - s. 191 IRPR – visitor
          - s. 211 IRPR – student
          - s. 194 IRPR – worker
    - Work Permits fall into two general categories:
        - LMIA required work permit:
              - The employer is required to “test the labour market” and conduct a genuine job search to find a locally qualified candidate.
              - Employer must submit a formal application to Service Canada for a positive or neutral LMIA.
              - Application fee is $1,000 CAD per applicant.
        - International Mobility Program:
              - Free Trade Agreement work permits, Spousal Work Permits, Post-Graduate Work Permits, Intra-Company Transferee Work Permits, etc.
              - For IMP work permits, the employer must provide their offer of employment directly to IRCC using the employer portal and pay the employer compliance fee of $230 CAD for each applicant. (s.209.11 IRPR)
    - Anya is a full-time Irrigation Engineer with ”Spouting Systems” in Poland (a company that specialises in farm irrigation systems). She would like to enter Canada for a three-week period to supervise the installation of an irrigation system. Canada Farms (CF) has a contract for purchase and sale for the system with Spouting Systems. CF bought it for $800K CAD and it was custom designed to meet CF’s needs for their 35 acres worth of pepper plants.
        - **What are her options for entry into Canada:** She may enter as a business visitor because she is ==not entering the labour market==.
        - **What if Anya is going to train the local team on how to use the irrigation system:** She may enter as a business visitor because although she is not doing inter-company training, she is not entering the labour market and After-Sales service generally permits training.
        - **What if Anya was going to complete the entire installation herself and CF asked her to operate it for a six-month period, would this change your opinion:** Yes – she would now need a work permit because there is labour market entry.
    - International Mobility Program - Work Permit: General process
        - <i class="fa-solid fa-1 number"></i> Determine whether an LMIA is required or if the FN will be applying under the International Mobility Program.
        - <i class="fa-solid fa-2 number"></i> Consider the nationality of the foreign national. This will determine where the person can apply:
            - eTA required or US national – may apply at the border for the Work Permit, no application forms needed, but supporting documentation to outline that the FN meets the requirements of the category is needed
            - TRV required national – must submit the request online, must complete application forms along with the necessary supporting documentation to ensure it clearly demonstrates that the FN meets the requirements of the work permit category being applied for
        - <i class="fa-solid fa-3 number"></i> The employer must register the job offer with IRCC via the “**employer portal**”. Once a file number is generated, this must be in the application form (if Visa-required) or in the border application paperwork.
        - <i class="fa-solid fa-4 number"></i> The representative compiles the application for submission. The representative should ensure that they outline clearly how the FN meets the requirements of the work permit category.
    - Canada has several streams that allow workers to come to Canada for temporary agriculture jobs.
        - Hire a temporary foreign worker through the **Agricultural Stream**
        - Hire a temporary foreign worker through the **Seasonal Agricultural Worker Program**
    - Jenna Hennebry, ["Permanently Temporary?"](https://irpp.org/research-studies/permanently-temporary/){:target="\_blank"}: She proposes the "Labour Migrant Integration Scale" as a tool for evaluating the results of temporary labour migration programs. Hennebry ends with recommendations for improving policy and practice in the management of temporary labour migration in agriculture, including **greater autonomy for workers in choosing where they work and live**, **regulation of the recruitment process**, **wider use of information sessions on health and safety**, and **access to certain settlement services such as basic language training**.
    - Who is eligible for a temporary resident permit (TRP)?
        - A temporary resident permit (TRP) may be issued to a foreign national who, in the opinion of an officer, is **inadmissible**, or who does not meet the requirements of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA) [A24(1)].
    - Per paragraph A24(3.1), a person whose claim for refugee protection has been determined to be ineligible to be referred to the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) may not request a TRP if **they have a pre-removal risk assessment (PRRA) application that is pending**.
    - Per paragraph A24(4)(a), a failed refugee claimant may **not** request a TRP if **all** of the following conditions are met:
        - Less than 12 months has passed since the day their claim for refugee protection with the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) was
            - rejected
            - determined to be withdrawn
            - abandoned
        - No appeal has been made to the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD).
        - No application for leave (and judicial review of that application) has been made to the Federal Court.
    - Per paragraph A24(4)(b), where a failed refugee claimant has appealed to the RAD or made an application for leave and judicial review of the decision to the Federal Court, the refugee claimant may **not** request a TRP unless at least 12 months has passed since the last
        - rejection of the claim by the RPD
        - rejection of the claim by the RAD
        - decision on the application for leave and judicial review from the Federal Court
    - Per paragraph A24(5), a designated foreign national may not request a TRP until five years after the day of any of the following:
        - the final determination of their claim for refugee protection, with no application for protection
        - the final determination on their application for protection
        - the foreign national becomes a designated foreign national
    - **Exception**: The one-year ban on accessing a TRP under subsection A24(4) does not bar an officer, on their own initiative, from considering a TRP for a victim of human trafficking.
        - To provide protection to vulnerable out-of-status foreign nationals who are victims of human trafficking, by regularizing their temporary status in Canada, when the officer is of the opinion that it is justified in the circumstances

## Quizzes

??? note "4.1.2 Chapters 1 and 2 of Cochran's Interviewing Skills"

    1. An effective interviewer is organized, has a plan and follows that plan. However, it is generally not a good idea to share the plan with the client as that may exert distortions into the process.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**Interview "mapping" has two important aspects. In one aspect, it is simply being organized, having a plan (route), and following that plan. However, ==an equally important second aspect is sharing the plan (road map) with the client==. See p. 37 for things to think about as you prepare for a client interview; and Table 2.1 on p. 37 for a chart of interview objectives, examples and methods.**

    2. Which if the following is an example of an informal interview:
        - [ ] A Job interview
        - [ ] A police interrogation
        - [x] A blind date
        - [ ] A legal interview
        <br>**Interviews take many different formats and range along a spectrum from informal to formal. ==An informal interview== is unstructured and free-flowing, including a chat with a friend, or meeting someone for the first time and getting to know them on a blind date. ==Moderately informal interviews== are relatively structured like a job interview, and legal interview. ==Formal interviews== are highly structured with a rigid process such as police interrogations (Table 2.2 on p. 38).**

    3. True or False:  In client-centered interviewing, the best way to establish a good rapport with a client is to take control of the interview to demonstrate your expertise in the legal subject matter.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**As Cochran mentions, in Chapter 2, ==in client-centered interviewing, the client is the focus==. It is more effective to break down barriers to client participation in order to make the client more comfortable and involved in the process (pp. 41-42).**

    4. A common reason clients misrepresent the circumstances of their legal situation to counsel they don’t want counsel to think badly of them.
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False
        <br>**As noted at pp. 18-19, a client may censor their own version of events to make sure that the interviewer does not disapprove of their behavior.**

    5. An example of a moderately formal interview is chatting with a neighbor or old friend.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**As noted in the chart on p. 38, an example of a moderately formal interview is a job interview or debate.**

    6. An example of a non-empowering statement is: “I think we'd better get back to the point.”
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False
        <br>**This statement is non-empowering for two reasons. First, it is directive and only takes into account what the interviewer feels is important at that point in time. It does not acknowledge what is important, or even necessary, for the client to deal with. Second, it is condescending, suggesting that the client has jumped off topic and that it is necessary for the interviewer to intervene to get things back on track. Better to say something like, “Those are some pretty good points, Mr. Brown, and thank you for raising them. I have a concern that we are a little short on time and I am going to need some more information in relation to your establishment in Canada/year of education back home/etc. or we won’t be able to properly prepare the application for submission by the end of the week.”**

    7. True or False: In an interview, one party usually has the formal task of information gathering.
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False
        <br>**As noted in Chapter 2 of the Cochran text, ==interviews are usually an exchange between two people one of whom has the task of information gathering==.  While there are group interview formats, only one person can ask questions at a time (p. 34).**

    8. You are interviewing a client in person for a spousal sponsorship and they seem very nervous and overwhelmed. The best way to help the new client feel more comfortable in an interview setting is to:
        - [ ] Incorporate legalese into your language to assure the client of your knowledge and expertise
        - [ ] Tell the client they have no reason to be nervous and proceed with the interview
        - [ ] Hand the client an intake form to fill out
        - [x] Offer the client a tea, coffee, or a glass of water
        <br>**Simple language without legalese or jargon will help the client to understand the process and feel more comfortable in the interview. Avoid invalidating or dismissing a client's feelings of anxiety. As indicated in Chapter 2, conscious attempts such as a warm greeting, the friendly atmosphere, and attentiveness will help put a client at ease (p. 43).**

    9. The emotional aspects of a client’s concerns can substantially interfere with representing a client. The reasons for this are because:
        - [ ] By acknowledging the emotional aspect’s importance, the immigration consultant begins to establish a rapport with the client.
        - [ ] If the emotional component is not dealt with properly, it will continue to interfere with the consultant’s interviewing agenda. Think of trying to shove and hold a volleyball under water—it can only be accomplished with continued effort.
        - [ ] Understanding the emotional component of the issue for the client will help the immigration consultant to understand the client and the issue the client is facing, and it will assist in the development of a strategy tailored to their needs.
        - [x] All of the above
        <br>**D: For example, if the consultant has a client who is experiencing extreme anxiety, getting the matter to hearing quickly may not be the best strategy. If the consultant forges ahead full steam toward hearing before the client feels ready, the client may lose confidence in them and in the firm. Pressing for a quick hearing may be counterproductive.**

    10. Which of the following methods of interviewing would be the best way to achieve the objective of helping a client to resolve a legal problem?
        - [x] Open-ended questions
        - [ ] Directive questions
        - [ ] Questionnaire
        - [ ] Written survey
        <br>**In Chapter 2 of the Cochran text, Table 2.1 on p. 37 outlines objectives, examples, and methods of interviewing. For resolving problems, open-ended questioning, values clarification, and advice are suggested as the methods to achieve the interview objectives. Questionaries, written survey and more directive questions are more useful for other objectives such as information gathering, and assessments.**

    11. Building **rapport** with a client always takes considerable time so an immigration consultant should not expect to foster rapport in early on in their interactions with clients.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**Building rapport will serve the immigration consultant well in both identifying issues and fact gathering, so it is extremely important to do it early on and do it well. Clear, direct, and respectful contacts with the client will help build the rapport that will encourage the client to work hand-in-hand with the immigration consultant to tackle the client’s needs and concerns.**

    12. Cochran notes that it is important for clients to have a feeling of personal empowerment in a legal interview. Which of the following is an example of an empowering statement:
        - [ ] I need information about…
        - [ ] That is not detailed enough.
        - [x] Could you assist in providing more information about…
        - [ ] That is all I need for today.
        <br>**Table 2.3 in Chapter 2 provides a comparison of empowering and non-empowering statements (p. 44).*

    13. True or False:  In client-centered interviewing, the best way to establish a good rapport with a client is to take control of the interview to demonstrate your expertise in the legal subject matter.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**As Cochran mentions, in Chapter 2, in client-centered interviewing, the client is the focus. It is more effective to break down barriers to client participation in order to make the client more comfortable and involved in the process (pp. 41-42).**

    14. An example of a moderately formal interview is chatting with a neighbor or old friend.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**As noted in the chart on p. 38, an example of a moderately formal interview is a job interview or debate.**

They decided to rent a car and drive to Canada, so that while in Canada, they can drive around and see the sights. Do they need an eTA for their entry to Canada?
        - [ ] Yes – as they are from an eTA required country and do not fall within one of the exemptions, they must have an eTA for their entry.

        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**You will not always be on a first name basis with clients, but still maintain a strong relationship. As Cochran notes in Chapter 3, there are many reasons, including cultural, gender and age dynamics, that might impact how you greet and refer to clients. Building a client relationship also takes time, and you will not always be on a first name basis with your client.**

    2. True or False: Business greetings have become more challenging during the Covid era, but a firm handshake is still the best way to greet your clients.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**False:  Covid-19 has impacted many ways that business is conducted including greetings such as handshakes. As noted on p.53, it may take years before some people feel comfortable shaking hands.**

    3. True or False: It is important for the client to know your position/role in the firm and your involvement in their case file.
        - [x] True
        - [ ] False
        <br>**It is important for the client to know your position/role in the firm and your involvement in their case file.**

    4. The non-directive style of interviewing is the only correct way of conducting an interview.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**It is important to be open and flexible in interacting with each client. ==A strategy that works well with one client may be disastrous with another.== A non-directive style may allow the client room to communicate what is important to them, but it should never be directionless. Clients should always feel that the consultant has a plan and they should recognize that an interviewer’s role is to secure information that will help to implement effective and timely representation that is responsive to a client's needs.**

    5. It is not very important for the client to get your name correct; after all, after the initial interview, most follow up communication will be by email.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**As discussed chapter 3, when the interviewer ensures that they have the client's name right, including pronunciation, and that the client has the interviewer's name right, the interviewer acknowledges the importance of this relationship. It personalizes the process and is the first step to establishing rapport with the client.**

    6. When a client arrives at your office for an interview it is best to:
        - [ ] Allow administrative staff to escort the client to your office
        - [ ] Wait 15 minutes before meeting the client so they think your office is busy
        - [x] Meet the client at reception and walk them to your office
        - [ ] Have your client walk to your office on their own if they are a trusted and established client
        <br>**As stated on p. 52, it is always best to go and greet your client yourself even when dealing with established clients. This will show your client how important they are to you and your desire to build and maintain a strong relationship. There are also logistical, security and privacy considerations for greeting and escorting your client yourself to your office.**

    7. Narrow questions are the most effective way to get a client's story out.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**The statement is categorical and therefore false. In other words, ==narrow questions can be helpful, but we cannot categorically say that they are the best way to help the client tell their story==. If a client is having trouble communicating and efforts to open the client up with broad questions are unsuccessful, then resorting to narrow (hopefully not leading) questions may be beneficial. So, for example, in relation to a car accident, it is perfectly fine to ask what colour the car that fled the scene was. It is not necessary to keep asking “Anything else?” until the client offers this information. Similarly, “When did you first notice the vehicle that struck the pedestrian?” is a relatively narrow question, as is “Did you notice how many occupants there were in the vehicle?” These are all questions that can be useful in a “funnel” sequence, where the questioning starts from a very broad approach and continues with a sequence of progressively narrower questions.**

    8. You don't have to worry about the accuracy or detail of information you obtain, because there is plenty of time to work that out as the file progresses.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        <br>**==Accuracy is the lifeblood of legal representation.== In addition to the potential that misleading information has to take the legal representation on a wild goose chase, inaccurate or misleading information can undermine the entire process. If the information is inaccurate, the wrong strategies may be implemented, and consultants will be surprised and disadvantaged by emerging facts that contradict what they have come to understand. If accuracy is not stressed in the early stages, the client picks up on the casual attitude and either adopts this approach or seeks legal representation elsewhere.**

    9. Which of the following is something that you should **NOT** do in winding down an interview:
        - [ ] Summarize what the client has told you
        - [x] Send non-verbal cues, such as gathering paper, glancing at your watch, etc., that the interview is over
        - [ ] Ask if there is anything else they want to add
        - [ ] Discuss next steps
        <br>**==Non-verbal cues== such as gathering paper, pushing yourself away from the table, putting your pen away, looking at the clock, may be perceived as ==dismissive== by clients. As Cochrane states (pp. 62-64), winding down the interview is an important part of the process of interviewing and sometimes very valuable information may come from this stage of the interview.  If clients feel through non-verbal cues that the interview is over, they be hesitant to share information that they have not previously brought up.**

    10. The interviewing technique of "**data mining**" involves
        - [x] Drilling down into a particular topic or area until all relevant information is obtained before moving on
        - [ ] Covering a large topic by getting the basic information required and quickly moving on to the next issue
        - [ ] Using narrow questions to determine the core legal issue involved
        - [ ] Asking multiple questions about different topic areas
        <br>**Cochran discusses the importance of ensuring that you have gotten everything of value on a particular area before moving on (p. 60).  He calls this approach "data mining" which implies drilling down until all valuable information has been extracted.**
