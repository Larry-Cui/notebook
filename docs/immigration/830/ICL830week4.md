??? note ""international mobility program" (IMP)"

    - IMP is not based on employer demand or a skills shortage but largely on multilateral/bilateral agreements with other countries. **No LMIA is required** and the program is based largely on reciprocity. Workers in this category are able to get **open work permits**, making participants in this program more mobile. Persons in this category are considered **highly skilled** and work in **high-wage** jobs.
    - the LMIA-exempt process also involves two steps. The first step is completed by the employer and the second step is the employee’s work permit application. The first step in the LMIA-exempt process, which the employer completes, is much **quicker**. No advertising or recruitment efforts are required. Instead, the employer submits an offer of employment through their **employer portal account** in the IRCC system. The online portal will then generate **a number** that the employee needs to use in their work permit application.
    - **A joint service agreement:** may be required if you are representing the employer and the foreign national. The employer must pay for the **employer compliance fee**, whereas the employer or foreign national can pay for the **work permit application**.

    - On December 15, 2022, there were several code changes and new codes added to the list of LMIA exemptions.  Student should ensure that they are using the **correct coding** based on the specific work permit category instructions, and be aware for cases that might arise where both old and new codes have been involved.
    - Whether a foreign national qualifies for an LMIA-exempt work permit is contingent on the **type of work** or activity that will be performed in Canada, the **foreign national's qualifications**, and/or **country of citizenship**.
