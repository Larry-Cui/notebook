??? note ""international mobility program" (IMP)"

    - IMP is not based on employer demand or a skills shortage but largely on multilateral/bilateral agreements with other countries. **No LMIA is required** and the program is based largely on reciprocity. Workers in this category are able to get **open work permits**, making participants in this program more mobile. Persons in this category are considered **highly skilled** and work in **high-wage** jobs.
    - the LMIA-exempt process also involves two steps. The first step is completed by the employer and the second step is the employee’s work permit application. The first step in the LMIA-exempt process, which the employer completes, is much **quicker**. No advertising or recruitment efforts are required. Instead, the employer submits an offer of employment through their **employer portal account** in the IRCC system. The online portal will then generate **a number** that the employee needs to use in their work permit application.
    - **A joint service agreement:** may be required if you are representing the employer and the foreign national. The employer must pay for the **employer compliance fee**, whereas the employer or foreign national can pay for the **work permit application**.
    - Extend or change the conditions on your work permit: Changing jobs or employers, [online](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/work-canada/permit/temporary/extend/change-jobs-employers.html){:target="\_blank"}
