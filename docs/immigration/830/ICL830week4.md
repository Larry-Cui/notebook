??? note ""international mobility program" (IMP)"

    - IMP is not based on employer demand or a skills shortage but largely on multilateral/bilateral agreements with other countries. **No LMIA is required** and the program is based largely on reciprocity. Workers in this category are able to get **open work permits**, making participants in this program more mobile. Persons in this category are considered **highly skilled** and work in **high-wage** jobs.
    - the LMIA-exempt process also involves two steps. The first step is completed by the employer and the second step is the employee’s work permit application. The first step in the LMIA-exempt process, which the employer completes, is much **quicker**. No advertising or recruitment efforts are required. Instead, the employer submits an offer of employment through their **employer portal account** in the IRCC system. The online portal will then generate **a number** that the employee needs to use in their work permit application.
    - **A joint service agreement:** may be required if you are representing the employer and the foreign national. The employer must pay for the **employer compliance fee**, whereas the employer or foreign national can pay for the **work permit application**.

    - On December 15, 2022, there were several code changes and new codes added to the list of LMIA exemptions.  Student should ensure that they are using the **correct coding** based on the specific work permit category instructions, and be aware for cases that might arise where both old and new codes have been involved.
    - Whether a foreign national qualifies for an LMIA-exempt work permit is contingent on the **type of work** or activity that will be performed in Canada, the **foreign national's qualifications**, and/or **country of citizenship**.

In fact, the visa post closed down and the application had to be transferred. The couple hasn’t been together for some time now and Thomas would like his spouse to come to Canada on a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) for the winter holiday. His spouse just lost her job in her home country, and he would like to be with her to support her. He is worried that his spouse’s application for Permanent Residence which is still in progress, might cause the refusal of the Temporary Resident Visa (TRV). Which of the following is most likely the reason the spouse’s TRV could be refused?

    20. Joe has owned Fabrication MM Inc., a wood products manufacturing company located in London, Ontario, since 2015. His company employs eight Canadian citizens on a full-time basis and some part-time work permit holders. Joe is looking to hire a cabinet assembler. He is offering a salary of 23$ per hour. During the last three months, he has been advertising using different sources. He placed announcements on two different local trade union job boards for two months, online with two national job websites for three months, and with Job Bank for 30 days already. No qualifying local Canadians were available for the job. However, there were a few good foreign candidates. He decided to hire one of the foreign nationals for this position right away. Does the employer meet the recruitment requirements for applying for a low wage LMIA?
        - [ ] No, the job posting with Job Bank must be 3 months in a row before the start of the LMIA application.
        - [ ] Yes, he has been advertising for the last 12 months and demonstrated genuine efforts to recruit Canadian citizens or Permanent Residents.
        - [ ] Yes, he has been advertising on Job Bank and at least two additional local activities during the last few months.
        - [x] No, his recruitment activities **did not target a different underrepresented group**, such as Indigenous peoples, vulnerable youth, newcomers, asylum seekers with valid work permits and persons with disabilities.
        > **Low-wage Job advertisement**: you must also conduct **at least 2 additional methods** of recruitment that are consistent with the occupation (targets an audience that has the appropriate education, professional experience and or skill level required for the occupation). Each of the methods used must target a **different underrepresented group**, such as:
        >
        > - Indigenous peoples
        > - vulnerable youth
        > - persons with disabilities
        > - newcomers to Canada, and
        > - asylum seekers with valid work permits
