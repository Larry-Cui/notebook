???+ note "Module 2 - Study Permits"

    - Study permits are needed for courses that are **longer than six months**.
    - The two most important parts of the study permit application package are the **study plan** and **financial documentation**.
    - Depending on whether your client is a visa-requiring or visa-exempt national, after **applying online**, they will be issued either a **student visa** or an **eTA** along with the letter/email approving their study permit application. The study permit will be **issued** at the POE.
    - Who can apply for the study permit at the POE: **US national**, **US PR**, **residents of Greenland and St Pierre and Miquelon**. (R214)
    - There is a different between a learning institution qualifying for a client to obtain a **study permit** and for a student to be eligible to apply for a **post-graduation work permit (PGWP)**.
    - If foreign-national (FN) parents are in Canada as students or workers, their minor children who want to attend primary or secondary school do not need to apply for a study permit. In such cases, the minor would apply for a visitor record.
    - Regardless of the [De Brito](https://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/fc-cf/decisions/en/item/40314/index.do){:target="\_blank"} decision, the authorization to work and study without a permit under paragraph R186(u) or section R189 while pending a decision on an application **ends on departure** from Canada. If the new study or work permit has not been issued prior to the applicant’s return, they may **not resume work or study** in Canada until their application for renewal has been granted. Official link: [here](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/implied-status-extending-stay.html){:target="\_blank"}.
    - If a student would like to change schools at the post-secondary level, [IRCC policy](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/change-schools.html){:target="\_blank"} states that they may do so as long as the new school is a DLI and the student **advises IRCC of the change**.
    - A study permit allows a foreign national to work up to **20 hours a week during regular academic sessions** and **full time during scheduled breaks** without a work permit. An international student will need to obtain a **social insurance number** from Service Canada to be allowed to work in Canada.
    - There are a few cases where you may be able to take a leave of up to a maximum of **150 days** from your program of studies and still be considered to be actively pursuing your studies. See [IRCC link](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/while-you-study/study-permit-conditions.html){:target="\_blank"}.
        - **You can’t work on or off campus during an authorized leave from your study program, even if your study permit says you’re allowed to work in Canada.**
    - A student must apply for the PGWP within 180 days of graduation. The **calculation of the 180 days** begins the day the **final transcript is issued**, or the day formal **written notice** of confirmation from the institution is obtained.
    - PGWP is issued based on the program of study. If the foreign national accelerated their studies, they would still be eligible for an PGWP corresponding to the length the program, not the actual study period.
    - Programs that are part of a [curriculum licensing arrangement](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/after-graduation/eligibility.html#curriculum){:target="\_blank"}, are offered by private career colleges on behalf of public, PGWP-eligible institutions. Starting **May 15, 2024**, graduates of curriculum licensing programs will **no longer be eligible** for PGWP.
