    - **Continuous Territory** rule: people can go to US and back without a TRV if they have legal status in Canada.
    - "**Bona Fide**" visitor: coming to Canada with a genuine purpose of visit (they have strong tie with home country and will come back after temporary visit).
    - **Dual Intent**: acknowledge the PR ready-ness, and show the intent to leave Canada at the end of the visit. Being a qualified applicant or having a good chance to apply for a PR does not make an applicant "dual intent".

    - Eight Main Factors for Assessing "Intention to Depart"
        - Whether the applicant has family or economic ties to country of residence
        - Whether the applicant has sufficient funds for stay in Canada
        - Applicant’s immigration status in country of residence
        - Economic and political conditions in applicant’s country of residence
        - Applicant’s obligations or responsibilities in country of residence
        - Applicant’s travel history
        - Whether applicant has family ties in Canada
        - Dual-intent
    - For temporary residence applications, your client will need a medical exam if they are planning to stay in Canada for **longer than six months** and meet any of these criteria:
        - Having lived in one or more of these countries or territories for at least six months in a row within the last yearn. (See the IRCC page entitled "Find out if you need a medical exam")
        - Coming to Canada to work in a job in which public health must be protected (see "Jobs for which you need a medical exam")
        - Applying for a parent and grandparent super visa
    - Information to share with your clients before they appear at the POE:
        - Know the nature and **contents of the application** they are making. The questions they will be asked will depend on what they are applying for. For example, visitors will be asked who they are coming to visit, where they will stay and for how long, who will pay for their expenses, etc. Workers will be asked where they will be working, how they are qualified for the job, etc.
        - **Answer the questions** honestly and completely. Suspicious answers may lead to additional questioning. If a client does not understand a question, they should ask the CBSA officer to repeat it instead of answering in a way that can be misconstrued.
        - CBSA officers can search any **digital devices** that the client has. As a result, clients should ensure before travelling that the devices they are bringing do not contain any information that contradicts the information provided in their application or the answers they give at the POE.
        - Carefully **check the permit** issued at the POE. If there are any errors or spelling mistakes, ask the CBSA officer to correct the permit. This is much easier than getting the permit amended after leaving the POE.
        - If applying for a work permit or a study permit that allows work off campus, ask the CBSA officer if the Social Insurance Number (SIN) can be issued at the POE. **Service Canada kiosks** are available at some POEs.
    - Visitor status usually expires six months after the foreign national enters Canada, unless the CBSA officer issues a Visitor Record for a different duration or writes a different expiry date under the entry stamp in the passport.
    - If a client applies extension before their visitor status expires but does not receive a decision on the application before their status expiry date, the client is permitted to stay in Canada until they receive a decision on the application. This is now referred to as **maintained status** by IRCC, and used to be called **implied status**.
    - If your client loses temporary resident status in Canada, either because they did not apply for an extension before their status expired or because their application was refused, they can apply to **restore** their status or they must **leave** Canada.
    - Options after Refusal:
        - If your client is in Canada, they may be able to apply for **restoration** or they must **leave** Canada. It is important to remember that your client has lost status when their application was refused. They are only permitted to apply for restoration if they are in Canada. If they leave Canada after applying for restoration, they cannot have their status restored.
        - **Reconsideration request** is a request made to the processing office asking the decision-maker or a supervisor to take a closer look at the documents provided with the application or a request to reconsider the negative decision based on new evidence that addresses the reasons for the refusal. For example, if a visitor visa is refused because of the applicant’s limited travel history, but the applicant’s passport shows numerous travel stamps, a reconsideration request can highlight the evidence that was overlooked.
        - **Application for leave and for judicial review** to the Federal Court can challenge a refused application. If the refusal is inside Canada, the applicant has **15 days** to start the Federal Court application. If the refusal is outside Canada, the applicant has **60 days** to start the Federal Court application. It is important to note that a successful judicial review application in the Federal Court will result in the application being returned to the processing office to be reconsidered by a different decision-maker, which does not ensure that the application will be approved. It is possible to submit both a reconsideration request and the Federal Court application for leave and judicial review. However, please note that the reconsideration request may not be decided if Federal Court litigation is also commenced.
        - **Re-applying** may be quicker and more cost-effective than applying for leave and judicial review. If a new temporary residence application is submitted, better supporting documents should be included if available and the reasons for refusal should be addressed. The processing fees will need to be paid again.
