??? note "LMIA and LMIA-based WP"

    - Joint Service Agreements:
        - LMIA-based work permits may involve you **representing the employer and foreign national**. You should have the appropriate agreements in place to ensure that all parties are aware of the nature of the relationship.
        - You should be aware of who is required to pay for what applications. For example, the **employer** must **pay for the LMIA application** and they **cannot recoup this cost** from the foreign national, whereas the **employer or foreign national can pay for the work permit application**.
    - As of November 16th, 2022, the NOC system made the switch from the previous NOC 2016 to the new current NOC 2021. Among other changes, the NOC 2021 system switched from skill type to TEER categories. [Online](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/subjects/standard/noc/2021/introductionV1){:target="\_blank"}

    - After you've collected all the facts, you'll need to start planning your strategy:
        - Consider **alternatives** to LMIA (WP exemptions, LMIA exemptions)
        - If LMIA is the best option, explain two-step process (LMIA then WP) and consider:​
            - Employer’s ability to qualify for LMIA ​
            - Employee’s ability to qualify for WP​
        - Consider different LMIA **streams** and options for expedited processing​
        - Discuss **compliance** (1 in 4 employers will be inspected)
