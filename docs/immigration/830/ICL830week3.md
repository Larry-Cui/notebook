??? note "LMIA and LMIA-based WP"

    - Joint Service Agreements:
        - LMIA-based work permits may involve you **representing the employer and foreign national**. You should have the appropriate agreements in place to ensure that all parties are aware of the nature of the relationship.
        - You should be aware of who is required to pay for what applications. For example, the **employer** must **pay for the LMIA application** and they **cannot recoup this cost** from the foreign national, whereas the **employer or foreign national can pay for the work permit application**.
    - As of November 16th, 2022, the NOC system made the switch from the previous NOC 2016 to the new current NOC 2021. Among other changes, the NOC 2021 system switched from skill type to TEER categories. [Online](https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/subjects/standard/noc/2021/introductionV1){:target="\_blank"}

    - After you've collected all the facts, you'll need to start planning your strategy:
        - Consider **alternatives** to LMIA (WP exemptions, LMIA exemptions)
        - If LMIA is the best option, explain two-step process (LMIA then WP) and consider:​
            - Employer’s ability to qualify for LMIA ​
            - Employee’s ability to qualify for WP​
        - Consider different LMIA **streams** and options for expedited processing​
        - Discuss **compliance** (1 in 4 employers will be inspected)

??? note "Employer Compliance"

    - Compliance is an important aspect of the Temporary Foreign Worker (TFW) program and the International Mobility Program (IMP), which is covered in Modules 4 and 5. The purpose is twofold:
        - to **protect** the integrity of the Canadian **labour market** by reviewing and encouraging the appropriate use of the programs; and
        - to **protect** temporary **foreign workers** from being exploited by employers.
    - For the Temporary Foreign Worker program, the employer must adhere to the conditions outlined in the LMIA application. **The employer must:**
        - comply with the conditions and time limits in each temporary worker’s work permit, for which the employer is legally responsible
        - employ the foreign worker on substantially the same terms and conditions, including wage, work hours, job duties and work location, as those set out in the LMIA
            - Once the foreign worker no longer works for the employer (either because the foreign worker has been terminated or their work permit expires) or if the foreign worker becomes a permanent resident, the employer is **no longer required** to adhere to the conditions
        - remain **actively engaged** in the business that submitted the offer of employment for as long as the temporary worker is employed
        - review and adjust the foreign worker’s wages, at least annually, to ensure that the foreign worker **continues to receive the prevailing wage** for the occupation and region of employment (Wages, however, should not be substantially changed without prior authorization from Service Canada)
        - retain employment records for a period of **six years** after the foreign worker commences employment, regardless of whether the foreign worker continues to be employed by the employer
        - cooperate with Service Canada in the event of inspection (which can be conducted by correspondence or on-site) to verify the employer’s compliance with the Temporary Foreign Worker program
            - Inspections may include verification of documents, worksite visits and/or interviews with foreign worker(s)
            - If an employer is found non-compliant, a range of consequences can be imposed, including warnings, monetary penalties and bans from the Temporary Foreign Worker program (Inspections are discussed in detail in the assigned readings for Module 3)
            - Representatives should recommend to their employer clients to obtain legal advice if they are selected for an inspection
        - establish administrative systems allowing them to separately monitor and track the foreign workers they employ; the foreign workers’ duties and terms of employment must always correspond with the commitments made in the LMIA application and the specific terms noted on each foreign worker’s work permit
        - pay the foreign workers by cheque or direct deposit and provide a pay stub indicating the deductions from the gross salary remitted to Canada Revenue Agency
        - keep all payroll records, time sheets, tax forms, receipts and documents related to any benefits, reimbursement of transportation costs, health insurance and/or workplace safety paid on behalf of the foreign workers, for a period of six years after the first date of foreign worker’s employment after obtaining the work permit
        - obtain advice before making any changes to the foreign workers’ terms and conditions of employment, as implementation of such changes may first require the filing of a **new LMIA** and obtaining a new work permit

    3. Charmaine owns a private school. Her sister-in-law, Judy, is a stay-at-home mother in her home country. Her husband (Charmaine's brother) has recently passed away and sister-in-law is there along with their two small children. Judy does not have any post-secondary education or any work experience. Charmaine has created an executive assistant position at the school for her sister-in-law and plans to submit a LMIA on her behalf after undergoing extensive advertising. She decided not to post the position on the Job Bank because she didn't care for the position to be exposed nationally since the position is created just to bring Judy to Canada. What might you tell Charmaine about her plans for this LMIA?
        - [x] The job offer is **not genuine**.
        - [ ] Charmaine must ensure she pays the appropriate wage.
        - [ ] Judy should get some job experience before she comes to Canada.

She wants to bring her sister, who is fluent in 7 languages, from her home country to assist in the translation business. She is getting all the documents ready to submit an LMIA for her sister but is shocked to discover that she must prove the legitimacy of her own business and an ability to support any job offer. Jane has never registered her own business and only takes cash for her translation services. She does not report her business income. Jane has never submitted a LMIA before. What challenges lie ahead for Jane?

        - [ ] It doesn't matter what documentation Jane lacks because she's offering the position to her sister which means the position offered is not genuine.

    17. Charmaine is the owner of a private school. She has recently submitted an LMIA application for the Principal position at her school. She provides the following details. She advertised for the position on the Job Bank, Vancouver Star, indeed.ca and in Canadian teacher's publications.  The wages being offered are just under $100,000 per year.

    23. Robinson Farms in PEI have recently expanded operations and have acquired an additional 1000-acres of forest where maple syrup is harvested. As well they have acquired several mink farms. The farm workers on staff do not have the experience nor knowledge in maple syrup harvesting nor that in raising or dealing with mink. Lori Robinson, farm manager, has business dealings with Alex Trkulja from Latvia who specializes in both mink production and maple syrup production. He has offered to send some of his experienced workers in exchange for a share of the profit from the crops. Lori is intrigued but knows that she first must ensure that there are no qualified Canadians/PRs who can do the job but is making inquiries on how she might be able to bring these workers. **What might be the best way to bring these workers and why? **
        - [ ] LMIA based specialized work permits based on the skilled workers needed
        - [x] LMIA through the **agricultural stream** as production is in the commodity sector
        - [ ] PNP job offers from Robinson Farms is the most efficient way to bring the workers
        - [ ] TRV is probably the best option as payment is only a share of the profits
