??? note "IMP: Employer-Specific Programs"

    - The work permit applications considered in this module are based on R205 Canadian interests - Significant benefit, where the importance of the LMIA can be overcome.
    - As described in Module 4, the LMIA-exempt process involves two steps. The first step is completed by the employer and the second step is the employee's work permit application. What the employer is required to do is to **submit an offer of employment through their employer portal**. The online portal will then generate **a number** that the employee needs to use in their work permit application.

        - In addition to meeting all the usual requirements of the ICT provisions, there are additional requirements that must be satisfied when dealing with start-ups or new Canadian operations. Most importantly, the application must include evidence that clearly demonstrates the company’s ability to **become established in Canada**.
        - Five Tips for Success:
            - A well-drafted and detailed **business plan** assists the officer reviewing the work permit application to understand the business that the company will engage in, the benefit to the Canadian economy (in the form of investment, job creation and/or the introduction of new products or services to the Canadian marketplace), and the need for the foreign worker to be able to provide services in Canada.
            - Generally speaking, the company must secure physical premises to house the Canadian operation.
            - There must be a qualifying relationship between the foreign entity that the individual works for and the Canadian operation they are being transferred to. Most commonly, the new Canadian operation will be a **branch, subsidiary or affiliate** of the foreign company.
            - When reviewing an application for a transferee seeking to work at a new Canadian operation the officer will want to see evidence of the new company’s ability to meet its financial obligations to workers and others. As such, the ability of the foreign parent company or affiliate to **financially support** the Canadian company until it can generate revenue is crucial.
            - While it is possible to **extend** the validity of the work permit at the end of the one-year period, the employer must be able to provide proof that the Canadian operation has **met the expectations** set out in its business plan during the year that the foreign worker has been in Canada.
    - **C13 – Emergency Repair:**
        - Purpose of exemption: Emergency repair personnel are persons whose admission is required in Canada to carry out emergency repairs to industrial or commercial equipment in order to prevent disruption of employment regardless of whether the equipment is under warranty.
        - Two streams:
            - **Emergency Repair Personnel**: to complete emergency repairs to commercial equipment to prevent the disruption of operations and employment, regardless of whether the equipment is out of warranty.

        - Usually issued for **short duration**
        - Required Reading: International Mobility Program: Canadian interests – Significant benefit – Emergency repair personnel or repair personnel for out-of-warranty equipment [R205(a)] (exemption code C13), [online](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/foreign-workers/exemption-codes/canadian-interests-significant-benefit-emergency-repair-personnel-repair-personnel-warranty-equipment-r205-exemption.html){:target="\_blank"}.
    - **C14 – Television and Film Production Workers:**

            - Destined for work **outside of Quebec**
            - Working in a position classified as **NOC 0, A, or B**
            - Using French as language of habitual/daily interactions

    - **C20 – Reciprocal Employment:**
        - Purpose of exemption: Allows foreign workers to take up employment in Canada when Canadians have similar reciprocal opportunities abroad
        - It is not necessary that there be exact reciprocity (i.e. one for one exchange or the same position), but the general order of magnitude of exchanges should be similar.

??? note "R204(a) "International agreements and under R205(a) "Significant benefits""

    Specialized knowledge work permit applications can be made under a free trade agreement pursuant to R204 or because issuing the work permit is in Canada’s interests (pursuant to R205). The following table summarizes the main differences and similarities between these two categories of work permits.

        - citizens of USA or Mexico (CUSMA), EU Member states (CETA), Member Nations (CPTPP);

    - R205(a): no restriction.

    **Employment Experience:**

    - R204(a): 1 year within the past 3 years OR 6 months in past 3 years;

    - R205(a): Must meet or exceed **prevailing wage**

    **Duration of Work Permit:**

    - Generally, issued for 1 or 3 years and renewable up to 5 years (need to keep track of exits and entries)
    - Officers are aware that the duration of the job offer should not influence the outcome. For example, work permits can be issued for short periods (i.e., 3 months) but the applicant must still demonstrate specialized knowledge.

    **Occupation:**

    -Officers will consider the NOC level (and experience/education).
    The position in Canada must be of an NOC level that is the same or similar to the applicant’s home position, unless the applicant is able to satisfy the visa officer that an exceptional situation exists.

    - It is important to note that an applicant must **request consideration for dual intent** under section 22(2) of the IRPA. An examining officer is not obligated to consider this remedy unless requested.
    - Even if relying on the dual intent provision, the applicant must demonstrate in their temporary residence application that they will **comply with the conditions** imposed on their temporary stay and leave Canada before their temporary status expires, regardless of the outcome of any potential future permanent residence application.
    - In assessing an application for temporary residence, an officer should consider:
        - the **length** of time that the applicant will be spending in Canada
        - the means of **support** as demonstrated by financial documents
        - any obligations and **ties** to the home country
        - the **purpose** and the context of the stay
        - the **credibility** of documents and information submitted
        - **past compliance** with the requirements applicable to temporary residents (visitors, students and workers)
