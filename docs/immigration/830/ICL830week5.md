??? note "IMP: Employer-Specific Programs"

    - The work permit applications considered in this module are based on R205 Canadian interests – Significant benefit, where the importance of the LMIA can be overcome.
    - As described in Module 4, the LMIA-exempt process involves two steps. The first step is completed by the employer and the second step is the employee’s work permit application. What the employer is required to do is to **submit an offer of employment through their employer portal**. The online portal will then generate **a number** that the employee needs to use in their work permit application.
