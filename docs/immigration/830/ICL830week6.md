# Week 6: IMP - Open Work Permits

## Notes

???+ note "Tutorial notes: case study and discussion"

    - Post-graduation work permit (PGWP) [R205(c) - C43](https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/study-permits/post-graduation-work-permit-program.html){:target="\_blank"}
    - Credibility and Insufficiency of Evidence. Read the following cases:
        - *Likhi v Canada (MCI)*, 2020 FC 171, [Online](http://canlii.ca/t/j51j0){:target="\_blank"}.
            - [26]  Given the **severe consequences of a finding of misrepresentation**, namely ineligibility to apply to come to Canada for a 5-year period, Ms. Likhi submits a **higher degree of procedural fairness is required** to ensure such findings are made only where there is clear and convincing evidence of misrepresentation: Ni v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), [2010 FC 162](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2010/2010fc162/2010fc162.html){:target="\_blank"} [Ni] at para 18; Lin v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), [2019 FC 1284](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2019/2019fc1284/2019fc1284.html){:target="\_blank"} [Lin] at paras 24-25; Seraj v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), [2016 FC 38](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2016/2016fc38/2016fc38.html){:target="\_blank"} [Seraj] at para 1; Lamsen v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), [2016 FC 815](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2016/2016fc815/2016fc815.html){:target="\_blank"} at para 24; Bao v Canada (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship), [2019 FC 268](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2019/2019fc268/2019fc268.html){:target="\_blank"} at paras 17-18.
            - [27] ... As noted in [*Vavilov*](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2019/2019scc65/2019scc65.html#par133){:target="\_blank"}, above at para 133, the severity of the outcome requires the decision maker’s reasons to reflect the stakes for, and from the perspective of, the affected individual:
                - It is well established that individuals are entitled to greater procedural protection when the decision in question involves the potential for significant personal impact or harm: [*Baker*](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1999/1999canlii699/1999canlii699.html#par25){:target="\_blank"}, at para. 25. However, this principle also has implications for how a court conducts reasonableness review. **Central to the necessity of adequate justification is the perspective of the individual or party over whom authority is being exercised.** Where the impact of a decision on an individual’s rights and interests is severe, the reasons provided to that individual must reflect the stakes. The principle of responsive justification means that if a decision has particularly harsh consequences for the affected individual, the decision maker must explain why its decision best reflects the legislature’s intention. This includes decisions with consequences that threaten an individual’s life, liberty, dignity or livelihood. [Bold emphasis added.]
            - [32] **I note credibility, on the one hand, and insufficiency of evidence, on the other, are distinct concepts that should not be conflated**, especially when a Visa Officer makes a finding of misrepresentation: Seraj, above at para [18](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2016/2016fc38/2016fc38.html#par18){:target="\_blank"}. **Findings of insufficiency, in themselves, do not amount automatically to misrepresentations.** Rather, a finding of misrepresentation is reasonable only where an applicant is shown to have **led incorrect information or omitted material information, intentionally or accidentally, which could have affected Canada’s ability to administer its immigration laws**: IRPA s 40(1); [*Muthui*](https://canlii.ca/t/g30pq){:target="\_blank"}, above at para 27.
            - [33] When determining whether the Senior Officer’s finding of misrepresentation was arrived at in a procedurally fair manner, it is important to clarify whether the Senior Officer’s finding was based on the evidence provided being **(a)** insufficient to demonstrate a bona fides marriage, as the Minister asserts was the case; or **(b)** not credible, genuine, or accurate, as Ms. Likhi submits. **If the former**, the Interviewing Officer was entitled to rely on the fact that the IRPA and IRPR give notice of the evidentiary threshold for proving compliance with Canada’s immigration laws, and thus had no procedural duty to alert Ms. Likhi to concerns of insufficiency in her application: Zhou, above at para 28: Bains, above at para 58. **If the latter**, the Interviewing Officer did have a duty to bring these concerns to Ms. Likhi’s attention, and to provide her with an adequate opportunity to disabuse the Interviewing Officer of them: Zhou, above at para 29.
            - [44] A principled approach to reasonableness review puts the reasons first, “…by examining the reasons provided with ‘respectful attention’ and seeking to understand the reasoning process followed by the decision maker to arrive at [the] conclusion”: Vavilov, above at para 84. **The focus of reasonableness review, therefore, must be on the decision, including the decision maker’s reasoning process and the outcome.** The reviewing court must consider only whether the decision, taking into account the rationale and outcome, was unreasonable, and must avoid substituting its own analysis or preferred decision: Vavilov, above at para 83. As noted by the SCC, “[t]he burden is on the party challenging the decision to show that it is unreasonable. …the court must satisfied that any shortcomings or flaws … are sufficiently central or significant to render the decision unreasonable”: Vavilov, above at para 100.
            - [45] ... “[W]here reasons are provided but they fail to provide a** transparent and intelligible justification** ..., the decision will be unreasonable”: Vavilov, above at para 136...

    12. Mi Kyong is a migrant worker who is on an employer-specific work permit which allows her to work for ABC Industrials. ABC Industrials is a cheese-making facility in Alberta which usually has 20 workers. Of these 20 workers, Mi Kyong is pretty sure that 15 of them are on the same work permit as her. Mi Kyong has been working for ABC Industrials for about 10 months and has gotten quite close with two of her co-workers who have worked there longer. She knows they are both also on the employer-specific work permit. One day in April, one of her co-workers is injured by the machinery and has to take three days off. Her co-worker thinks the machinery might be faulty and wants to report it to a government authority for inspection. When ABC Industrials finds this out, they deny her coworker the full month of pay and threaten to deny any future pay if the coworker reports the injury or seeks a medical case. They then threaten any employee who reports this or any other injury with docked pay. Is **Mi Kyong eligible for an open work permit**?

        - [ ] No, because she already has a work permit that allows her to work in Canada.
        - [ ] Yes, because her employer is hiring more than the allowed amount of workers on closed work permits.

    13. Laviza has just applied for an open work permit under the vulnerable worker's class. Her employer, Ontario Farms, repeatedly withheld payment and would garnish her wages.

She also noticed that her pay cheque was always lower after she made complaints to management about their inconsistent payment schedule. Laviza has described her experience in a letter of explanation and has provided copies of her pay stubs – is this **evidence sufficient** to prove her claim?
        - [ ] No, an officer will likely require supporting or additional material to substantiate claims.
        - [ ] It depends, it is not the amount of evidence but whether the facts and evidence are credible on a balance of probabilities.
        - [x] It depends, it is not the amount of evidence but whether the **officer has reasonable grounds to believe that the evidence is credible**.
        - [ ] Laviza's evidence is likely sufficient. Laviza must undergo an interview with an immigration officer and the evidence gleaned during this interview is much more important.

As Pyotr has just turned 16, he feels he is old enough to work and wants to save some money for the future. He has found a job at the library and wants to know if he can work it. He hopes that if he works there for two years, he will be able to get enough experience and money to pursue becoming a librarian. Can he continue with this plan and get an appropriate work permit?
        - [ ] No, because a library is a civil and public institution and he is not a Canadian national.
        - [ ] Yes, but he will only be able to work for two years as he can apply as the family of a foreign representative and he is the same age as a student.
        - [ ] No, because he is 16 and would be working under-age.
