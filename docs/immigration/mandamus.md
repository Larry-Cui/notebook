# Case Study: a writ of _mandamus_

## Target case

_Alinejad v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)_, [2024 FC 1994 (CanLII)](https://canlii.ca/t/k89nv){:target="\_blank"}

## Test for _mandamus_

**[16]** ... The test was raised in _Apotex Inc v Canada (Attorney General)_, [1993 CanLII 3004 (FCA)](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fca/doc/1993/1993canlii3004/1993canlii3004.html){:target="\_blank"}.

**[17]** As reproduced from _Almuhtadi v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)_, [2021 FC 712](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2021/2021fc712/2021fc712.html){:target="\_blank"} [*Almuhtadi*] at para 30, the Applicant must satisfy the following **eight conditions** before the Court will exercise its discretion to issue mandamus:

1. There must be a public legal duty to act;
2. The duty must be owed to the applicant;
3. There is a clear right to performance of that duty;
4. Where the duty sought to be enforced is discretionary, consideration must be given to the nature and manner of exercise of that discretion;
5. No other adequate remedy is available to the applicant;
6. The order sought will be of some practical value or effect;
7. There is no equitable bar to the relief sought; and
8. On a “balance of convenience,” an order of mandamus should be issued.

**[18]** In addition, the Court outlined three requirements that must be met if a delay is to be considered **unreasonable** in _Conille v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)_, [1998 CanLII 9097 (FC)](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/1998/1998canlii9097/1998canlii9097.html){:target="\_blank"}:

1. The delay in question has been longer than the nature of the process required, _prima facie_;
2. The applicant and his counsel are not responsible for the delay; and
3. The authority responsible for the delay has not provided satisfactory justification.

**[19]** Further, the Applicants must demonstrate there is “**significant prejudice**” caused by the delay: _Vaziri v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)_, [2006 FC 1159](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2006/2006fc1159/2006fc1159.html){:target="\_blank"} [Vaziri] at para 52, citing _Blencoe v British Columbia (Human Rights Commission)_, [2000 SCC 44](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/2000/2000scc44/2000scc44.html){:target="\_blank"} at para 101; _Chen v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)_, [2023 FC 885](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2023/2023fc885/2023fc885.html){:target="\_blank"} at para 16.

## Ongoing screening is not sufficient cause

**[23]** ... As the case law confirms, simply stating that a background or security screening is ongoing, without more, is not an adequate explanation for the delay: _Almuhtadi_ at para [40](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2021/2021fc712/2021fc712.html#par40){:target="\_blank"}; _Bidgoly v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)_, [2022 FC 283](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2022/2022fc283/2022fc283.html){:target="\_blank"} at para 46; _Sowane v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)_, [2024 FC 224](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2024/2024fc224/2024fc224.html){:target="\_blank"} at para 29.
