??? note "Guideline 8: Accessibility to IRB Proceedings"

    - IRB, [Chairperson’s Guideline 8: Accessibility to IRB Proceedings — Procedural Accommodations and Substantive Considerations](https://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/legal-policy/policies/Pages/GuideDir08.aspx){:target="\_blank"} (October 31, 2023​)
    - **Anyone** participating in a proceeding at the IRB can make a request for accommodation. This includes clients, but also counsel and other witnesses.
    - **Requests for accommodations** must be made in accordance with the relevant Rules of the Division. You can request a **case conference** prior to the hearing to discuss the specifics of an accommodation. 
    - The Guideline also provides guidance to Members to avoid reliance on **myths, stereotypes, and incorrect assumptions** relating to vulnerabilities, disabilities, and/or personal characteristics in their decision-making process. When you observe that the Member or the opposing counsel is relying on these myths, stereotypes and incorrect assumptions in their questioning, you may **object to** their questions on the basis that they are not adhering to this Guideline.
    - Trauma-informed adjudication principles. Members must:
        - lead the proceeding with sensitivity to help **prevent re-traumatization** through the IRB decision-making process; 
        - **anticipate** the possibility that trauma may impact a person's memory and ability to provide testimony and 
        - create a **safe adjudicative environment** for all participants to facilitate the giving of testimony. 

??? note "Designated Representatives, Accessibility, and Related Situations"

    - A designated representative is a person who may make decisions and representations on behalf of a **claimant** who is younger than 18 or who is unable to appreciate the nature of the proceedings before the RPD or RAD.
    - **Designated representatives** must be 18 or older, they must be able to understand the nature of the proceedings before the Refugee Protection Division, or RPD, and they must not have interests that conflict with the claimant’s. Parents are usually the designated representative for their children.
    - The Federal Court’s decision in *Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Patel*, [2008 FC 747](https://canlii.ca/t/1xv43){:target="\_blank"} discusses their role.
        - [38] The Court therefore finds that the Board is not unreasonable or incorrect when it fails to explicitly address the subjective fear of the minor child. **It was open to the Board to infer the subjective fear of the minor child from the evidence presented,** including the testimony of the child’s designated representative who was speaking on his behalf.
        - [45] The Court has constantly recognized that a tribunal is required to assess the cumulative impact of the hardships faced by the claimant. **Therefore, even if none of the individual harms feared by the applicant are persecutory when viewed individually, the combined or cumulative effect of these harms may be persecutory.** In this way, the cumulative effect of “merely” discriminatory acts can amount to persecution. The tribunal is required to assess the circumstances of the claimant, including the claimant’s age, when assessing whether or not the harm feared amounts to persecution.
        - [58] The applicant submits that humanitarian and compassionate considerations have no place in the determination of whether or not a claimant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. And that the Board is required to make a determination on the basis of the factors set out in sections 96 and 97 of the Act. **Any humanitarian and compassionate factors raised by a particular claimant, such as the best interests of the child, can only be fully considered once a determination is made on the issue of whether a claimant merits protection in Canada.**
        - [63] In addition, the *Guidelines on Children Refugee Claimants* clearly states that “refugee children have different requirements from adult refugees when they are seeking refugee status”. For instance, the Guidelines provide that in determining the procedure to follow when considering the refugee claim of a child, the Board should give primary consideration to the “best interests of the child”. It also states that: “**the ‘best interests of the child’ should be given primary consideration at all stages of the processing of these claims**”.
