??? note "Guideline 8: Accessibility to IRB Proceedings"

    - IRB, [Chairperson’s Guideline 8: Accessibility to IRB Proceedings — Procedural Accommodations and Substantive Considerations](https://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/legal-policy/policies/Pages/GuideDir08.aspx){:target="\_blank"} (October 31, 2023​)
    - **Anyone** participating in a proceeding at the IRB can make a request for accommodation. This includes clients, but also counsel and other witnesses.
    - **Requests for accommodations** must be made in accordance with the relevant Rules of the Division. You can request a **case conference** prior to the hearing to discuss the specifics of an accommodation. 
    - The Guideline also provides guidance to Members to avoid reliance on **myths, stereotypes, and incorrect assumptions** relating to vulnerabilities, disabilities, and/or personal characteristics in their decision-making process. When you observe that the Member or the opposing counsel is relying on these myths, stereotypes and incorrect assumptions in their questioning, you may **object to** their questions on the basis that they are not adhering to this Guideline.
    - Trauma-informed adjudication principles. Members must:
        - lead the proceeding with sensitivity to help **prevent re-traumatization** through the IRB decision-making process; 
        - **anticipate** the possibility that trauma may impact a person's memory and ability to provide testimony and 
        - create a **safe adjudicative environment** for all participants to facilitate the giving of testimony. 

??? note "Designated Representatives, Accessibility, and Related Situations"

    - A designated representative is a person who may make decisions and representations on behalf of a **claimant** who is younger than 18 or who is unable to appreciate the nature of the proceedings before the RPD or RAD.
    - **Designated representatives** must be 18 or older, they must be able to understand the nature of the proceedings before the Refugee Protection Division, or RPD, and they must not have interests that conflict with the claimant’s. Parents are usually the designated representative for their children.
    - The Federal Court’s decision in *Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Patel*, [2008 FC 747](https://canlii.ca/t/1xv43){:target="\_blank"} discusses their role.
        - [38] The Court therefore finds that the Board is not unreasonable or incorrect when it fails to explicitly address the subjective fear of the minor child. **It was open to the Board to infer the subjective fear of the minor child from the evidence presented,** including the testimony of the child’s designated representative who was speaking on his behalf.
        - [45] The Court has constantly recognized that a tribunal is required to assess the cumulative impact of the hardships faced by the claimant. **Therefore, even if none of the individual harms feared by the applicant are persecutory when viewed individually, the combined or cumulative effect of these harms may be persecutory.** In this way, the cumulative effect of “merely” discriminatory acts can amount to persecution. The tribunal is required to assess the circumstances of the claimant, including the claimant’s age, when assessing whether or not the harm feared amounts to persecution.
        - [58] The applicant submits that humanitarian and compassionate considerations have no place in the determination of whether or not a claimant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. And that the Board is required to make a determination on the basis of the factors set out in sections 96 and 97 of the Act. **Any humanitarian and compassionate factors raised by a particular claimant, such as the best interests of the child, can only be fully considered once a determination is made on the issue of whether a claimant merits protection in Canada.**
        - [63] In addition, the *Guidelines on Children Refugee Claimants* clearly states that “refugee children have different requirements from adult refugees when they are seeking refugee status”. For instance, the Guidelines provide that in determining the procedure to follow when considering the refugee claim of a child, the Board should give primary consideration to the “best interests of the child”. It also states that: “**the ‘best interests of the child’ should be given primary consideration at all stages of the processing of these claims**”.

??? note "Principles for Evaluating Credibility"

    - Three most important principles regarding credibility:
        - First, the principle from *Maldonado* that the evidence of a refugee protection claimant is to be **presumed true unless there is a reason to doubt** their truthfulness. This presumption may be rebutted. Examples of credibility concerns that may rebut the presumption of truthfulness are listed in *Rahal* and *Magonza*. They include **contradictions** or **inconsistencies** in the evidence, findings based on **implausibility**, and findings based on the **demeanour** of a claimant or witness.
        - Second, fairness requires that any **doubts** about credibility must be **put to a claimant** in order for an adverse inference to be fair. The requirement of giving notice is discussed in the IRB’s guide to [Assessment of Credibility in Claims for Refugee Protection](https://irb.gc.ca/en/legal-policy/legal-concepts/Pages/Credib.aspx){:target="\_blank"} (December 31, 2020).
        - Third, as stated in *Rahal* at paragraph 46, “where a decision turns on credibility, it is incumbent on the RPD [or RAD] to provide reasons for its assessment given the importance of the issues at stake in a refugee claim.” The **RPD or RAD must explain** why it has rejected a claimant’s explanation or response to the concerns raised about credibility.

??? note "From Theory to Practice"

    - Scenario 1: A local shelter has referred a client to you. She is a 15-year-old girl who crossed the border irregularly into Canada and made a claim for refugee protection. While young, she is exceptionally mature and clearly able to grasp the nature of her upcoming hearing before the Refugee Protection Division (RPD). She tells you that she has not secured representation and no one has been helping her with her claim. What steps should you take?
        - Subrule 20(1) of the *Refugee Protection Division Rules* states that “[i]f counsel or if an officer believes that the Division should designate a representative for the claimant … because the claimant … is under 18 years of age … counsel or the officer must without delay notify the Division in writing.” On the facts given, you do not know whether an officer notified the RPD that they believe it should name a representative for the claimant. Therefore, **you should write the RPD write away to advise them** of your belief that they must **appoint a designated representative for her**.
    - Scenario 2: Your client is an elderly man, about 84 years old, who was a victim of torture in his country of origin. You believe his age and trauma will significantly affect his ability to give coherent testimony about his experiences before the RPD. What steps should you take?
        - You should consider seeking **procedural accommodations** to ensure your client has a fair opportunity to present his case. To do so, you will need to make an application (see rule 50 of the RPD Rules; see paragraph 12 of Chairperson’s Guideline 8). Such an **application should be made as soon as possible** (Chairperson’s Guideline 8, paragraph 11). If possible, you should seek to support the claim with **psychological evidence** (Chairperson’s Guideline 8, paragraph 13). 
        - As part of the application, you should request appropriate procedural accommodation. **The specifics of what you should request will depend on your client.** It may be that creating a more **informal** setting, varying the **order** of questioning will be sufficient, or asking for a **support** person to be present will suffice (see Chairperson’s Guideline 8, paragraph 10). 
    - Scenario 3: Your client is a woman from Iran. Her and her husband’s claim was rejected by the RPD, where she was represented by other counsel. You asked to meet with them separately. While meeting with her to prepare her appeal, she tells you for the first time that prison guards raped her. The reason she did not reveal the rape earlier because her husband was with her during all her meetings with counsel, as well as at the RPD hearing. How might you bring the allegation of rape **before the Refugee Appeal Division**? 
        - Your client might swear an **affidavit** or make a statutory declaration detailing her experience in the prison. You would then have to include that affidavit or statutory declaration as new evidence in the perfected appeal record and call the RAD’s attention to it (see Refugee Appeal Division Rules, subrule 3(3)(d)(i) and (e)).
        - You also need to include **argument as to why this new evidence should be accepted** (RAD Rules, subrule 3(3)(g)(iii)). **Subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act states that a person who is the subject of an appeal may only present evidence that is “new”,** including evidence that the “person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection.”
        - Here you may argue that due to the husband’s presence during meetings with counsel and at the RPD hearing, in the circumstances your client could not reasonably have been expected to present evidence of her rape at the time of the rejection.
        - In support, you may cite **section D.1 of Chairperson’s Guideline 4**, on **gender-based claims**, which states: “Women from societies where the preservation of one's virginity or marital dignity is the cultural norm may be reluctant to disclose their experiences of sexual violence in order to keep their "shame" to themselves and not dishonour their family or community.” 
    - Scenario 4: Your client is making a claim based on their sexual orientation. During the hearing, the RPD member begins asking them about their sexual experiences since coming to Canada. When your client says they has not had any, the RPD member asks, “Why not? After all, there’re no laws against homosexual behaviour here.” Should you intervene?
        - You may want to **intervene** to remind them that it is **inappropriate to rely on stereotypes** when adjudicating claims based on sexual orientation and/or gender identity or expression (Chairperson’s Guideline 9, section 6).
        - You may specifically want to bring their attention to the fact that it is a stereotype to think that “**[i]ndividuals with diverse SOGIE would actively participate in LGBTIQ+ culture in Canada, including frequenting LGBTIQ+-predominant areas and social establishments, or be involved in community organizations and groups.**” (Chairperson’s Guideline 9, section 6, last bullet point) 
    - Scenario 5: Before the RPD, a family of claimants included a father, his wife, and their 5-year-old child. The father was named the designated representative of the child. The RPD rejected the claim of the father and the child, but accepted the claim of the mother. The mother and father divorced in the days before the RPD released its decision. The mother was granted custody of the child. You are the RAD member. Should the father continue to serve as the designated representative for the child? 
        - Recall that the RAD must act in the best interests of the child (Chairperson’s Guideline 3, section I). The Guideline also contemplates situations where it is no longer appropriate for a designated representative to continue in that role (see section II).
        - Subrule 23(1) of the RAD Rules states that if the RPD named a designated representative for a claimant, that **person is deemed to have been designated by the RAD unless the RAD orders otherwise**.
        - Subrule 23(5) of the RAD Rules states that a designated representative must: be 18 years of age or older; understand the nature of the proceedings; be willing and able to act in the best interests of the person who is the subject of the appeal; and not have interests that conflict with those of the person who is the subject of the appeal.
        - the RAD may wish to name an **independent designated representative** (i.e., neither the mother nor father) to act on the child’s behalf.
