        - 1966 International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights: This instrument includes **guarantees of the human right** to life and the right to be free from cruel and unusual treatment or punishment. It bars states from removing foreign nationals if a violation of one of these rights would result.
        - 1969 Convention governing Specific Aspects of Refugee Problems in Africa: This instrument extends refugee protection to be compelled to leave their country because of "external aggression, occupation, foreign domination, or events seriously disturbing public order in either part or the whole of his country of nationality."
        - 1984 Cartagena Declaration on Refugees: This instrument extends refugee protection to "persons who have fled their country because their lives, safety or freedom have been threatened by generalized **violence**, foreign **aggression**, internal **conflicts**, massive **violations** of human rights or other circumstances which have seriously disturbed public order."

        - [ ] True

        - [ ] True
        - [x] False
        > Chetail says that this is a revisionist interpretation of the Convention, which does not reflect the negotiating history or the actual practice of states. He also says that it does not reflect the actual rights as they are set out in the Convention. **The Convention’s content is not the result of “a deliberate nor coherent design of its drafters.”** (Chetail, pp 181-182).

The end of the path is naturalization.
        - [ ] The beginning of the path are the human rights granted in instruments like the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights. The end of the path is permanent residence.
        - [ ] The beginning of the path is exit from one’s country of origin. The end of the path is recognition as a refugee under the Convention.
