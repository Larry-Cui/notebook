??? note "Introduction and Required Readings"

    - we will examine how the Refugee Protection Division, the Refugee Appeal Division, and the courts:
        - Decide which **country** a person’s claim should be assessed against
        - Evaluate whether a claimant has a **well-founded** fear of persecution
        - Decide whether a claimant’s feared persecution has an appropriate **nexus**; that is, whether it is for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion
        - Decide whether a claimant is unable to **access** state protection in their country of origin; and
        - Decide whether there is **nowhere** in their country of origin that they can live safely, i.e., that they do not have what is called an **internal flight alternative**

??? note "Claims for Refugee Protection"

    - **Section 96** of the IRPA defines a “**Convention refugee**” as someone who faces a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of one of five Convention grounds.
    - **Section 97** of the IRPA defines a “**person in need of protection**” as someone who faces either a danger of torture or a risk to their life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.
    - Two Ways to Succeed:
        - A person claiming refugee protection can succeed if they show they meet the criteria in **either section 96 or section 97**.
    - Two Ways to Fail:
        - To be rejected the RPD or RAD must find that the person claiming refugee protection meets the requirements of **neither section 96 nor section 97**.
        - Alternatively, a person has been found to be excluded from refugee status under section 98 of the IRPA.
        - s 98: A person referred to in section **E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention** is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.
            - **E.** This Convention shall not apply to a person who is **recognized** by the competent authorities of the country in which he has taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of the nationality of that country.
            - **F.** The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:
                - (a) he has committed a **crime** against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes;
                - (b) he has committed a **serious non-political crime** outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee;
                - (c) he has been **guilty** of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations
    - Grammatical Rules
        - AND/OR: **conjunctive** vs **disjunctive**
    - **s 96:** A **Convention refugee** is a person who, by reason of a **well-founded fear** of persecution for **reasons** of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion
        - is **outside** each of their **countries of nationality** and is **unable** or, by reason of that fear, **unwilling** to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or
        - not having a country of nationality, is **outside** the **country of their former habitual residence** and is **unable** or, by reason of that fear, **unwilling** to return to that country.
    - **s 97: (1)** A **person in need of protection** is a person **in Canada** whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally
        - (a) to a danger, believed **on substantial grounds to exist**, of **torture** within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; **or**
        - (b) to a **risk to their life** or to a risk of **cruel and unusual treatment or punishment** if
            - (i) the person is **unable** or, because of that risk, **unwilling** to avail themself of the protection of that country,
            - (ii) the risk would be faced by the person in **every** part of that country and is **not faced generally** by other individuals in or from that country,
            - (iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and
            - (iv) the risk is **not caused by** the inability of that country to provide adequate **health or medical care**.
    - **s 97: (2)** A person in Canada who is a member of a class of persons prescribed by the regulations as being in need of protection is also a person in need of protection.
    - Torture Definition: requires the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering, physical or mental, inflicted by or with the involvement of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.

??? note "Introducing Francisco Ramírez López"

    - Notes from Interview with Francisco Ramírez López (June 28, 2019). Please see a sample Basis of Claim narrative [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OfvU9mbHijNZYdNnZ8tlIIgbtJ2h7UfR/view?usp=sharing){:target="\_blank"}. 
    - First, tell me a bit about yourself. 
        - I am Francisco Ramírez López. I am 66 years old. I was born on June 1, 1955, in Irapuato. Irapuato is in the state of Guanajuato, Mexico. I am a citizen of Mexico. … I am sorry. I am a bit nervous. I don’t know why. What do you want to know? 
    - Maybe tell me about your family. 
        - I have a son and a daughter. I had another daughter, Elizabeth Ramírez Hernández. She died in 2004, hit by a car. I think the car may have been driven by her ex-boyfriend, a police officer. It was terrible, but despite our suspicions, the police would not investigate. She spent three days in the hospital and then died of her wounds. … I think … I think of her every day … My son … my son does not live in Irapuato. He has moved to Loreto, which is in Baja California. He works in a restaurant there. It is hard to go to visit him, because of the shop, but he comes and visits us from time to time. He is not married, which I wonder about. …. My other daughter, Alejandra Ramírez Hernández, still lives in Irapuato and works in my shop with my wife and I. She has lived with us, too, ever since her divorce. She has a son and daughter, who sometimes live with her, sometimes with her husband. …  
    - Ok. Good. We can firm up the details later. Tell me about your life in Irapuato.  
        - I own a motor parts shop in Irapuato. The shop is called La Bodeguita Moto Partes Y Accessorios, a motor parts shop, in Irapuato, in the state of Guanajuato, Mexico. I run the shop with my wife and my eldest daughter, who has lived with us since divorcing her husband, as I said. We also have two employees, although in the past we’ve had 4 or 5. Lately business has not been as good, because of the amount of extortion. About 20 years ago, I would have to had to pay only about 100 pesos per month in extortion money. Now, I regularly pay about 5000 pesos per month.   
    - To whom do you pay extortion?  
        - I don’t remember who I was paying 20 years ago. It may have been Los Zetas. More recently the money has gone the Cartel Santa Rosa de Lima. I wish I didn’t have to pay, but extortion is just the cost of doing business. The police cannot protect us, so we have to pay. Going to the police is not possible. Or it is a waste of time. … 
    - OK. Now, can you tell me a bit about why you have come to Canada now to seek refugee protection? 
        - Although I have been extorted for years, my real troubles began in 2019. … I was attacked by members of the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generaçion. They told me they were looking for my sister and wanted me to tell them where to find her. There were three or four of them. One of them twisted my arm behind my back while another pointed a gun at me, and another asked me where my sister was. When I said I did not know, I was hit and kicked. The man holding my arm twisted it so hard it broke. I collapsed on the ground. They went away. …  My younger sister, María Ramírez López, belongs to the local police. I have always loved María de Jesus. I was 14 when she was born. When she was a child, she would follow me around like I was a God. I hope that does not sound arrogant. Maybe it is. But it’s what it was like. She would hang around with me every day after school, watching me as I worked on cars in the local neighbourhood. I’ve always loved cars, fixing them, taking them apart and putting them back together. … I was worried about María de Jesus when, after high school, she decided to go into the police. But by then she was a fierce young woman who believed in keeping the people in our city safe. … I have only grown more worried about her as the city became more dangerous. But she has continued to work with integrity, even after marrying and having a child. To the extent it is possible, she did her job well. I am proud of her. …  
    - Are you ok? Would you like to take a break? 
        - No. It’s fine. 
    - Ok. Can you tell me why you think you might have been attacked? 
        - In 2018 or maybe 2017 … I’m not sure … the members of one Cartel, the Santa Rosa de Lima, murdered the nephew of the leader of another cartel. The other cartel was the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generaçion. Their leader is El Mencho – a terrible man. For years there has been fighting between the two cartels in Guanajuato, our state. Nueva Generaçion wants to take over the drug business and the theft of oil – there are, you know, pipelines running through the state –, but Santa Rosa is not backing down. The two cartels fight, and lots of innocent people and police officers lose their lives. This is one of the reasons I worry for my sister. … She had a run-in with Nueva Generaçion at around April or May 2019. … That is, members of the Santa Rosa had murdered El Mencho’s nephew in a coffeeshop in January 2017. The police took it very seriously. My sister told me they were taking the murder very seriously. In Mexico, a lot of murders get treated like nothing, but this one was treated like something because – well – no one wanted to imagine how bad things could get if the issue was not settled by the police. Even more people dying. … I think the police took it seriously because they did not want violence between the SLRC and CJNG to spin even further out of control. … My sister was not on the investigation, but the police were not solving it. Finally, her boss decided to use more officers to investigate the murder of the nephew. So my sister joined the investigation. Her partner too. … Of course, she wanted to help. But this was also the beginning of her trouble. … That’s because the Cartel Jalisco had grown impatient – even more impatient. I think they had not been able to find El Marro. That’s the head of the Santa Rosa de Lima.  
    - Sorry. The Jalisco had not been able to find El Marro? 
        - Yes … That’s right. Cartel Jalisco had not been able to find El Marro, so they thought they might have more luck by squeezing the police. … They would go to the officers working on the investigation and try to get them to tell them what they knew. They would accuse them of being corrupt. Threaten them, you know. Of working for the Santa Rosa de Lima. Of taking bribes, you know, to make the investigation go nowhere. … It makes some sense, but I know my sister would not take bribes. She has never taken bribes. You just have to look at her, at her house, at the way she lives. She never takes vacations. She does not have a car. She rides a, what do you call it, a scooter. No. She does not take bribes. … But the investigation continued to go nowhere. Cartel Jalisco members accused my sister and some of her colleagues of being in the Santa Rosa’s pocket. They threatened them with death if they did not tell them where to find their chief. But my sister refused. … I think her other colleagues refused too. … At least that’s what I think because the Jalisco attacked and killed two officers on the investigation. That may have been in April, May, or June 2019. I’m not sure. … But after that happened, my sister went into hiding. Of course, she did. And they attacked me and broke my arm and said they would be back in a week …  
    - Can you tell me what you did after they attacked you? 
        - My wife and I went to the Centro Medico, where they did an x-ray and gave me a cast. … We spent the next day trying to decide what to do. I couldn’t reach my sister, so I didn’t know what to do. I wanted to leave with my wife and daughter. I said it was not worth keeping the business going. I am old anyway. But they wanted to stay. My wife said she could not start over in a new place. My daughter said she would stay with her mother to look after her. Besides she had her children, who she could not leave … Our discussions of what to do went on in circles for days and days. I stayed hidden in home, lying in bed, afraid. We sometimes yelled. My wife cried. … Then, one week later, one of our employees from the shop said that someone had slipped a note into our mailbox. It said “Tu hermana o tu vida – El Mencho.” You know. Do you speak Spanish? 
    - No. 
        - Your sister or your life, signed El Mencho, the head of the Nueva Generaçion. When I saw the note, I began to shake, like this. … I called my wife to tell her. She said, “Well, Francisco, now you have to go.” I agreed with her. We cried together on the phone. … I made arrangements quickly so the shop could be run by my wife and daughter. Then I packed my things. I drove me to the airport in Mexico City the next day with my daughter. I was terrified the whole way, for both of us. … Then she left me at the airport, and I went to the ticket desk. I couldn’t get a ticket I could afford for two days, so I hid out in the sleep pods in the airport. They are these pods, like mini-hotels, where you can sleep. They are called Izzzleep. Spelled I-z-z-z-l-e-e-p. I only went outside to buy food. I was scared the Nueva Generaçion would come find me. Maybe that did not make sense. I don’t know. I was very confused. The Nueva Generaçion are very dangerous, and they are everywhere. … They even attacked the police chief in Mexico City. … When I finally boarded the plane, I felt so relieved. Ever since then I have been living with my cousin in Toronto. 
    - Ok thank you. I suggest that we stop for today. Thank you for telling me your story. What I will do is go over what you’ve told me, prepare an outline, and then we will go over it together in more detail.
