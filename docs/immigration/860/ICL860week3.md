# Week 3: Inclusion-I

## Notes

??? note "Tutorial notes"

    - Sunday 9:00am.

??? note "Introduction and Required Readings"

    - we will examine how the Refugee Protection Division, the Refugee Appeal Division, and the courts:
        - Decide which **country** a person’s claim should be assessed against
        - Evaluate whether a claimant has a **well-founded** fear of persecution
        - Decide whether a claimant’s feared persecution has an appropriate **nexus**; that is, whether it is for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion
        - Decide whether a claimant is unable to **access** state protection in their country of origin; and
        - Decide whether there is **nowhere** in their country of origin that they can live safely, i.e., that they do not have what is called an **internal flight alternative**

??? note "Claims for Refugee Protection"

    - **Section 96** of the IRPA defines a “**Convention refugee**” as someone who faces a well-founded fear of persecution on the basis of one of five Convention grounds.
    - **Section 97** of the IRPA defines a “**person in need of protection**” as someone who faces either a danger of torture or a risk to their life or of cruel and unusual treatment or punishment.
    - Two Ways to Succeed:
        - A person claiming refugee protection can succeed if they show they meet the criteria in **either section 96 or section 97**.
    - Two Ways to Fail:
        - To be rejected the RPD or RAD must find that the person claiming refugee protection meets the requirements of **neither section 96 nor section 97**.
        - Alternatively, a person has been found to be excluded from refugee status under section 98 of the IRPA.
        - s 98: A person referred to in section **E or F of Article 1 of the Refugee Convention** is not a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection.
            - **E.** This Convention shall not apply to a person who is **recognized** by the competent authorities of the country in which he has taken residence as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of the nationality of that country.
            - **F.** The provisions of this Convention shall not apply to any person with respect to whom there are serious reasons for considering that:
                - (a) he has committed a **crime** against peace, a war crime, or a crime against humanity, as defined in the international instruments drawn up to make provision in respect of such crimes;
                - (b) he has committed a **serious non-political crime** outside the country of refuge prior to his admission to that country as a refugee;
                - (c) he has been **guilty** of acts contrary to the purposes and principles of the United Nations
    - Grammatical Rules
        - AND/OR: **conjunctive** vs **disjunctive**
    - **s 96:** A **Convention refugee** is a person who, by reason of a **well-founded fear** of persecution for **reasons** of race, religion, nationality, membership in a particular social group or political opinion
        - is **outside** each of their **countries of nationality** and is **unable** or, by reason of that fear, **unwilling** to avail themself of the protection of each of those countries; or
        - not having a country of nationality, is **outside** the **country of their former habitual residence** and is **unable** or, by reason of that fear, **unwilling** to return to that country.
    - **s 97: (1)** A **person in need of protection** is a person **in Canada** whose removal to their country or countries of nationality or, if they do not have a country of nationality, their country of former habitual residence, would subject them personally
        - (a) to a danger, believed **on substantial grounds to exist**, of **torture** within the meaning of Article 1 of the Convention Against Torture; **or**
        - (b) to a **risk to their life** or to a risk of **cruel and unusual treatment or punishment** if
            - (i) the person is **unable** or, because of that risk, **unwilling** to avail themself of the protection of that country,
            - (ii) the risk would be faced by the person in **every** part of that country and is **not faced generally** by other individuals in or from that country,
            - (iii) the risk is not inherent or incidental to lawful sanctions, unless imposed in disregard of accepted international standards, and
            - (iv) the risk is **not caused by** the inability of that country to provide adequate **health or medical care**.
    - **s 97: (2)** A person in Canada who is a member of a class of persons prescribed by the regulations as being in need of protection is also a person in need of protection.
    - Torture Definition: requires the intentional infliction of severe pain or suffering, physical or mental, inflicted by or with the involvement of a public official or other person acting in an official capacity.

??? note "Introducing Francisco Ramírez López"

    - Notes from Interview with Francisco Ramírez López (June 28, 2019). Please see a sample Basis of Claim narrative [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1OfvU9mbHijNZYdNnZ8tlIIgbtJ2h7UfR/view?usp=sharing){:target="\_blank"}. 
    - First, tell me a bit about yourself. 
        - I am Francisco Ramírez López. I am 66 years old. I was born on June 1, 1955, in Irapuato. Irapuato is in the state of Guanajuato, Mexico. I am a citizen of Mexico. … I am sorry. I am a bit nervous. I don’t know why. What do you want to know? 
    - Maybe tell me about your family. 
        - I have a son and a daughter. I had another daughter, Elizabeth Ramírez Hernández. She died in 2004, hit by a car. I think the car may have been driven by her ex-boyfriend, a police officer. It was terrible, but despite our suspicions, the police would not investigate. She spent three days in the hospital and then died of her wounds. … I think … I think of her every day … My son … my son does not live in Irapuato. He has moved to Loreto, which is in Baja California. He works in a restaurant there. It is hard to go to visit him, because of the shop, but he comes and visits us from time to time. He is not married, which I wonder about. …. My other daughter, Alejandra Ramírez Hernández, still lives in Irapuato and works in my shop with my wife and I. She has lived with us, too, ever since her divorce. She has a son and daughter, who sometimes live with her, sometimes with her husband. …  
    - Ok. Good. We can firm up the details later. Tell me about your life in Irapuato.  
        - I own a motor parts shop in Irapuato. The shop is called La Bodeguita Moto Partes Y Accessorios, a motor parts shop, in Irapuato, in the state of Guanajuato, Mexico. I run the shop with my wife and my eldest daughter, who has lived with us since divorcing her husband, as I said. We also have two employees, although in the past we’ve had 4 or 5. Lately business has not been as good, because of the amount of extortion. About 20 years ago, I would have to had to pay only about 100 pesos per month in extortion money. Now, I regularly pay about 5000 pesos per month.   
    - To whom do you pay extortion?  
        - I don’t remember who I was paying 20 years ago. It may have been Los Zetas. More recently the money has gone the Cartel Santa Rosa de Lima. I wish I didn’t have to pay, but extortion is just the cost of doing business. The police cannot protect us, so we have to pay. Going to the police is not possible. Or it is a waste of time. … 
    - OK. Now, can you tell me a bit about why you have come to Canada now to seek refugee protection? 
        - Although I have been extorted for years, my real troubles began in 2019. … I was attacked by members of the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generaçion. They told me they were looking for my sister and wanted me to tell them where to find her. There were three or four of them. One of them twisted my arm behind my back while another pointed a gun at me, and another asked me where my sister was. When I said I did not know, I was hit and kicked. The man holding my arm twisted it so hard it broke. I collapsed on the ground. They went away. …  My younger sister, María Ramírez López, belongs to the local police. I have always loved María de Jesus. I was 14 when she was born. When she was a child, she would follow me around like I was a God. I hope that does not sound arrogant. Maybe it is. But it’s what it was like. She would hang around with me every day after school, watching me as I worked on cars in the local neighbourhood. I’ve always loved cars, fixing them, taking them apart and putting them back together. … I was worried about María de Jesus when, after high school, she decided to go into the police. But by then she was a fierce young woman who believed in keeping the people in our city safe. … I have only grown more worried about her as the city became more dangerous. But she has continued to work with integrity, even after marrying and having a child. To the extent it is possible, she did her job well. I am proud of her. …  
    - Are you ok? Would you like to take a break? 
        - No. It’s fine. 
    - Ok. Can you tell me why you think you might have been attacked? 
        - In 2018 or maybe 2017 … I’m not sure … the members of one Cartel, the Santa Rosa de Lima, murdered the nephew of the leader of another cartel. The other cartel was the Cartel Jalisco Nueva Generaçion. Their leader is El Mencho – a terrible man. For years there has been fighting between the two cartels in Guanajuato, our state. Nueva Generaçion wants to take over the drug business and the theft of oil – there are, you know, pipelines running through the state –, but Santa Rosa is not backing down. The two cartels fight, and lots of innocent people and police officers lose their lives. This is one of the reasons I worry for my sister. … She had a run-in with Nueva Generaçion at around April or May 2019. … That is, members of the Santa Rosa had murdered El Mencho’s nephew in a coffeeshop in January 2017. The police took it very seriously. My sister told me they were taking the murder very seriously. In Mexico, a lot of murders get treated like nothing, but this one was treated like something because – well – no one wanted to imagine how bad things could get if the issue was not settled by the police. Even more people dying. … I think the police took it seriously because they did not want violence between the SLRC and CJNG to spin even further out of control. … My sister was not on the investigation, but the police were not solving it. Finally, her boss decided to use more officers to investigate the murder of the nephew. So my sister joined the investigation. Her partner too. … Of course, she wanted to help. But this was also the beginning of her trouble. … That’s because the Cartel Jalisco had grown impatient – even more impatient. I think they had not been able to find El Marro. That’s the head of the Santa Rosa de Lima.  
    - Sorry. The Jalisco had not been able to find El Marro? 
        - Yes … That’s right. Cartel Jalisco had not been able to find El Marro, so they thought they might have more luck by squeezing the police. … They would go to the officers working on the investigation and try to get them to tell them what they knew. They would accuse them of being corrupt. Threaten them, you know. Of working for the Santa Rosa de Lima. Of taking bribes, you know, to make the investigation go nowhere. … It makes some sense, but I know my sister would not take bribes. She has never taken bribes. You just have to look at her, at her house, at the way she lives. She never takes vacations. She does not have a car. She rides a, what do you call it, a scooter. No. She does not take bribes. … But the investigation continued to go nowhere. Cartel Jalisco members accused my sister and some of her colleagues of being in the Santa Rosa’s pocket. They threatened them with death if they did not tell them where to find their chief. But my sister refused. … I think her other colleagues refused too. … At least that’s what I think because the Jalisco attacked and killed two officers on the investigation. That may have been in April, May, or June 2019. I’m not sure. … But after that happened, my sister went into hiding. Of course, she did. And they attacked me and broke my arm and said they would be back in a week …  
    - Can you tell me what you did after they attacked you? 
        - My wife and I went to the Centro Medico, where they did an x-ray and gave me a cast. … We spent the next day trying to decide what to do. I couldn’t reach my sister, so I didn’t know what to do. I wanted to leave with my wife and daughter. I said it was not worth keeping the business going. I am old anyway. But they wanted to stay. My wife said she could not start over in a new place. My daughter said she would stay with her mother to look after her. Besides she had her children, who she could not leave … Our discussions of what to do went on in circles for days and days. I stayed hidden in home, lying in bed, afraid. We sometimes yelled. My wife cried. … Then, one week later, one of our employees from the shop said that someone had slipped a note into our mailbox. It said “Tu hermana o tu vida – El Mencho.” You know. Do you speak Spanish? 
    - No. 
        - Your sister or your life, signed El Mencho, the head of the Nueva Generaçion. When I saw the note, I began to shake, like this. … I called my wife to tell her. She said, “Well, Francisco, now you have to go.” I agreed with her. We cried together on the phone. … I made arrangements quickly so the shop could be run by my wife and daughter. Then I packed my things. I drove me to the airport in Mexico City the next day with my daughter. I was terrified the whole way, for both of us. … Then she left me at the airport, and I went to the ticket desk. I couldn’t get a ticket I could afford for two days, so I hid out in the sleep pods in the airport. They are these pods, like mini-hotels, where you can sleep. They are called Izzzleep. Spelled I-z-z-z-l-e-e-p. I only went outside to buy food. I was scared the Nueva Generaçion would come find me. Maybe that did not make sense. I don’t know. I was very confused. The Nueva Generaçion are very dangerous, and they are everywhere. … They even attacked the police chief in Mexico City. … When I finally boarded the plane, I felt so relieved. Ever since then I have been living with my cousin in Toronto. 
    - Ok thank you. I suggest that we stop for today. Thank you for telling me your story. What I will do is go over what you’ve told me, prepare an outline, and then we will go over it together in more detail.

??? note "Onus and Identity"

    - it is well-established that the **person making the claim** for refugee protection **bears the onus** of establishing all the elements of the claim. The RPD or RAD cannot rely **solely** on the arguments provided by the claimant.
    - Typically, the claimant will do so with a mixture of **claimant-specific evidence** as well as more **generic documentary evidence** concerning conditions in their country of origin.
    - It is important to note here that there is a difference between the **evidentiary onus** for each required element and the **legal test** that must be satisfied.
    - [*Mmono v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2013/2013fc219/2013fc219.html){:target="\_blank"}, 2013 FC 219​
        - [13] The Board is not required to make a claimant’s case or advance a grounds for a claim that an applicant did not contend.
        - [14] However, the Court of Appeal did require the Board to consider evidence that obviously emerged from the evidence.
    - Generic documentary evidence may be submitted by the claimant or may come from the [National Documentation Package](https://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/country-information/ndp/Pages/index.aspx){:target="\_blank"}, or NDP, that is maintained by the IRB for all countries.
    - the NDP for the claimant’s country or countries of origin are considered **part of the record** before the RPD and the RAD in any claim. The claimant needs to **familiarize** themselves with the documents in the NDP that might support or challenge their claim.
    - when a claim is rejected because of **credibility** concerns, the Federal Court reviews the RPD or RAD’s findings on an **extremely deferential basis**, since credibility is said to lie within the “heartland” of their discretion. (See *Siad v. Canada (Secretary of State)*, [[1997] 1 FC 608 (CA)](https://canlii.ca/t/4n98){:target="\_blank"}, cited most recently in *Ahmed v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2021 FC 351](https://canlii.ca/t/jflpn){:target="\_blank"} at para 26.)
    - since 1980, it has been accepted that the statements of a refugee protection claimant are **presumed true**. This presumption was stated expressly in the Federal Court of Appeal decision in *Maldonado  v.  Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)*, [[1980] 2  F.C. 302 (C.A.)](https://canlii.ca/t/jqkrb){:target="\_blank"}, at 305:
        - When [a claimant] swears to the truth of certain allegations, this creates a presumption that those allegations are **true unless** there be reason to doubt their truthfulness.
    - **Negative** credibility findings rebutting the presumption of truthfulness may be based on:
        - Contradictions, inconsistencies, omissions
        - Implausibilities
        - Silence of the documentary evidence
        - Incoherent or vague testimony, level of knowledge
        - Alteration or fabrication of documents
        - Lack of identity or other documents
    - the UNHCR [Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status](https://www.unhcr.org/publications/legal/5ddfcdc47/handbook-procedures-criteria-determining-refugee-status-under-1951-convention.html){:target="\_blank"} (at paragraph 196) states that refugee claimant’s should be given the benefit of the doubt in seeking to establish their claim:
        - 196 It is a general legal principle that the burden of proof lies on the person submitting a claim. Often, however, an applicant may not be able to support his statements by documentary or other proof, and cases in which an applicant can provide evidence of all his statements will be the exception rather than the rule. … Even such independent research may not, however, always be successful and there may be statements that are not susceptible of proof.  In such cases, **if the applicant's account appears credible, he should, unless there are good reasons to the contrary, be given the benefit of the doubt.**
    - A majority of the Supreme Court cited this passage approvingly in Chan v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration), [[1995] 3 SCR 593](https://canlii.ca/t/1frhh){:target="\_blank"} at para 142.
        - The benefit of the doubt should, however, only be given **when all available evidence has been obtained and checked and when the examiner is satisfied as to the applicant's general credibility**.  The applicant's statements must be coherent and plausible, and must not run counter to generally known facts.
    - Identity and Rejection of Claim. *Senghor v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2016 FC 1041](https://canlii.ca/t/h310w){:target="\_blank"}:
        - [16] A claimant who cannot establish their identity will not be granted refugee protection. It has been consistently held in this Court that failure to establish identity is fatal (*Najam v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2004 FC 425](https://canlii.ca/t/1grvx){:target="\_blank"};  *Rahal v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2012  FC  319](https://canlii.ca/t/fqtsx){:target="\_blank"}). The most frequently quoted passage comes from  *Yang v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2009 FC 681](https://canlii.ca/t/24cpz){:target="\_blank"}, where Justice  Snider wrote at paragraph  6:
            - As I read the jurisprudence, the law is clear that, **where identity is not established it is unnecessary to further analyze the evidence and the claims** (Li v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration), [2006 FC 296](https://canlii.ca/t/1mr2x){:target="\_blank"} at para. 8;  Husein v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), [1998 CanLII 18842](https://canlii.ca/t/4bv5){:target="\_blank"}). However, when making identity findings, the Board must arrive at its conclusions based upon the totality of the evidence relevant to identity before it.
    - [A sample decision](https://drive.google.com/file/d/17iXg6jXDAe_pq2H7y_HmIjaCP2BKijPy/view?usp=sharing){:target="\_blank"} rejecting a claim due to lack of identity establishment. 

??? note "Identity and Credibility"

    - **Identity Scenario:** The claimant alleges to be a citizen of Sri Lanka. The claimant alleges that he entered Canada on a false document, which was taken by the agent. The claimant has provided no identity documents except for an illegible document purporting to be a Birth Certificate. It is a copy of a copy. The claimant has not made any attempt to obtain any identity documents from Sri Lanka. Identify:
        - A. Challenges the claimant might face establishing their identity and/or credibility. 
        - B. Questions a member of the Refugee Protection Division might raise. 
        - C. Strategies for addressing those questions.
    - Answers:
        - A.  1) The fact that the claimant entered Canada using a false document may show that they might have **access** to other false documents; 2) The fact that the claimant entered Canada using a false document may be taken as an indication that they are **willing** to use false documents to advance their claim; 3) The birth certificate as described does not seem to match Sri Lankan birth certificates as described in Document 3.1 of the Sri Lanka NDP (LKA200299.E); 4) Document 3.1 of the Sri Lanka NDP (LKA200299.E) indicates that document fraud, including with respect to birth certificates, is common in Sri Lanka; 5) Failure to make efforts to obtain other identity documents may be taken into account in assessing the claimant’s credibility, under IRPA s 106.
        - B. The RPD is likely to ask the claimant about **where he obtained the false document and why he did not have or travel on an authentic passport**. The RPD is also likely to ask the claimant about the provenance of the birth certificate; why it does not match the description of birth certificate from Document 3.1 in the NDP; and likely why he does not have a birth certificate matching the description of genuine birth certificates. Finally, the RPD is likely to ask the claimant what efforts he has made to obtain other identity documents.
        - C. You and your client should brainstorm about what efforts you might make to obtain genuine identity documents. For instance, you might see if family or friends in Sri Lanka could send identity documents. Alternatively, you might see if the client could apply for identity documents from the Sri Lankan embassy without putting himself at further risk. For instance, Document 3.1 in the Sri Lanka NDP indicates that the Consulate General of Sri Lanka in Toronto has the authority to issue temporary travel documents.

??? note "Alienage and Country of Reference"

    - The following readings treat the first of these requirements – that a claimant be outside each of their countries of citizenship or, if they are stateless, outside their countries of former habitual residence. This is sometimes referred to as the alienage requirement:
        - *Tretsetsang v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2016 FCA 175](https://canlii.ca/t/gs2j6){:target="\_blank"}
        - IRB, [Interpretation of the Convention Refugee Definition in the Case Law](https://irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/legal-policy/legal-concepts/Pages/RefDef.aspx){:target="\_blank"} (March 31, 2019) chapter 2.
    - If the claimant has a country of nationality, the claim should be assessed **only** against that country and not against some other country where the claimant may have residency status. If a claimant is a national of more than one country, the claimant must show that they are a Convention refugee with respect to **all** such countries.
    - Where citizenship in another country is available, a claimant is expected to make attempts to acquire it and will be denied refugee status if it is shown that it is within their power to acquire that other citizenship. Consequently, a person who is able to obtain citizenship in another country by complying with **mere formalities** is not entitled to avail themself of protection in Canada.
    - A consideration of former **habitual residence is only relevant** where the claimant is stateless. A stateless person is someone who is **not recognized** by any country as a citizen.
    - The Court of Appeal in [*Thabet*](https://canlii.ca/t/4mj3){:target="\_blank"} at 33 and 39, in the context of discussing whether a stateless claimant who has more than one country of former habitual residence must establish the claim with respect to one, some or all of the countries, had this to say about the issue of state protection:
        - … The definition takes into account the inherent difference between those persons who are nationals of a state, and therefore are owed protection, and those persons who are stateless and without recourse to state protection. Because of this distinction one cannot treat the two groups identically, even though one should seek to be as consistent as possible. (At 33.)
        - … If it is likely that a person would be able to return to a country of former habitual residence where he or she would be safe from persecution, that person is not a refugee. This means that the **claimant would bear the burden** … of showing on the balance of probabilities that he or she is **unable or unwilling to return to any country of former habitual residence**. (At 39.)

        > To succeed, the claimant must establish each required element of either section 96 or 97 on a balance of probabilities.
        > "**beyond a reasonable doubt**" is a **higher** standard of proof used in criminal cases, demanding near certainty of guilt, while "**balance of probabilities**" is a **lower** standard used in civil cases, requiring only that a claim is more likely than not true. 

    5. The refugee claimant bears the onus to show that they are not excluded from refugee protection under section 98 of the IRPA.
	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False
        > The **Minister or the RPD/RAD bears the onus for exclusion** under section 98.

	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False

    11. According to Desloges & Sawicki, when assessing whether a refugee claimant has a well-founded fear, the Refugee Protection Division will assess:
        - [ ] Whether the claimant actually experiences fear
        - [ ] Whether the fear experienced by the claimant is reasonable in the circumstances
        - [ ] Whether there is safe haven inside the country of nationality where the claimant can seek protection
        - [x] All of the above
        > The assessment of well-founded fear has both an **objective and subjective** component. The objective component considers if the fear is reasonable in the circumstances and considers the circumstances in which the fear arises. The subjective component considers the personal perspective of the claimant. **As part of the objective component, the refugee claimant may be required to show that there is no safe haven inside the country of nationality** (i.e., that there is no internal flight alternative or IFA). See "Well-Founded Fear" in Part V, Chapter 11,E,1b.

??? note "Alienage and Country of Reference"

    1. Which of the following is said to be required in *Tretsetsang v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2016 FCA 175](https://canlii.ca/t/gs2j6){:target="\_blank"} as a way proving that access to citizenship is thwarted through the administration of the law in a claimant's country of origin? 
        - [x] Proof of reasonable but unsuccessful efforts to acquire citizenship. 
        - [ ] Proof that the claimant has pursued litigation to contest a negative decision on a citizenship application.
        - [ ] Proof that the only way to get a citizenship application approved is through bribery. 
        - [ ] Proof that a legal discretion exists within the law.
        > See paragraph 72 of the decision. The majority stops short of saying that pursuit of litigation, as suggested in answer B, is required. Proof that bribery is required, as suggested in answer C, may also be helpful in such a case. However, that possibility is not discussed in *Tretsetsang*. Note that the majority emphasizes that "[w]hat will constitute reasonable efforts to overcome a significant impediment (that has been established by any particular claimant) in any particular situation can only be determined on a case-by-case basis." (See para 73.) Finally, note that D is not the right answer because the question concerns administrative, not legal, impediments.

        - [ ] Country is not the country of reference for Machiavelli's claim because it denied him entry.
        - [x] Country is the country of reference for Machiavelli's claim because it is his former country of habitual residence. He had a significant period of **de facto residence** there.
        - [ ] Country is the country of reference for Machiavelli's claim. He lived there for the minimum of three years necessary to establish it as his country of former habitual residence.
        - [ ] Country is not the country of reference for Machiavelli's claim. He has not lived there for the minimum of five years necessary to establish it as his country of former habitual residence.

    3. Aaron is a citizen of the United States because he was born there. He is also a citizen of France because his parents are French citizens. He has spent most of his life in Canada and is a permanent resident here. He files a claim for refugee protection in Canada. Which of the following statements is true? 
        - [ ] Aaron's claim is ineligible because he is a permanent resident of Canada.
        - [ ] There are no facts given that indicate Aaron's claim is ineligible. It must be established against France because his parents are French citizens.
        - [x] There are no facts given that indicate Aaron's claim is ineligible. It must be established with respect to both the United States and France because Aaron is a citizen of both those countries. 
        - [ ] There are no facts given that indicate Aaron's claim is ineligible. It must be established against both his countries of citizenship (United States and France) as well as his country of habitual residence (Canada). 
        > There is no specific ground of ineligibility for permanent residents of Canada under IRPA, s 101. Permanent residents may be ineligible if another ground of ineligibility applies. Aaron's claim must be established against both his countries of nationality. **It need not be established against Canada because he possesses citizenship in France and the United States.** Also, Canada is not his country of former habitual residence, nor is he outside it. 

    4. James is a citizen of Mexico, Guatemala and a former habitual resident of Costa Rica. Which of these countries will be a country of reference for his claim:

    6. If a claimant has multiple nationalities, their refugee protection claim need only be established with respect to the country to which they have established a genuine attachment.
	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False

    7. If it is within the control of the applicant to acquire the citizenship of a country with respect to which he has no well-founded fear of persecution, the claim for refugee status will be denied. 
	    - [x] True
	    - [ ] False

    8. If a claimant has a country of nationality and also a (different) country of former habitual residence, the claim should be assessed against both countries. 
	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False

    9. Every stateless person is a Convention refugee.

    10. In *Tretsetsang v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2016 FCA 175](https://canlii.ca/t/gs2j6){:target="\_blank"}, which of the following was the court's holding on the right of citizenship in the applicant's country of origin? 
        - [ ] This case should not follow Khan v Canada because there was no right to citizenship at law in Khan, which is not the case in *Tretsetsang*. 
        - [x] A claimant alleging the inability to access citizenship in a particular country must show they **took reasonable efforts to overcome impediments** to citizenship but were unsuccessful.

        - [ ] When considering the claimant's control to access protection, there is a distinction between discretion that exists at law and discretion that the state exercises extralegally. 

    11. A claimant is attempting to establish that, while citizenship is in principle available under the law in their country of origin, the administrative process is burdensome to the point that it is de facto unavailable. What evidence should the claimant bring forward to support this proposition?
        - [ ] None. If the law makes citizenship available, proof of administrative impediments cannot help the claimant's case. 
        - [x] Evidence of administrative impediments.
        - [ ] Evidence regarding the constitutional law in the country of origin. 
        - [ ] Evidence that the state does not have a discretion to reject a valid claim for citizenship. 

??? note "Well-Founded Fear of Persecution"

    1. In [*Zeah v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*](https://canlii.ca/t/j8csl){:target="\_blank"}, the Court drew an adverse inference when the applicant's claim in Canada included an important fact that was missing in her claim in the U.S. 
	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False
        > The Court held it was incumbent on the RAD to assess the claimant's actions in light of her individualized circumstances. While the claimant made refugee claims in the U.S. without disclosing her sexual orientation, she had valid concerns about such disclosure to her U.S. lawyer and her husband. The SOGIE Guideline stresses the importance of assessing the significance of any inconsistencies or material omissions in a claimant's account in light of any cultural, psychological or other barriers that may reasonably explain the inconsistency or the omission. See paras 72-73 of Zeah v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration).

    2. According to [*Ward v Canada (Minister of Employment & Immigration)*](https://canlii.ca/t/1fs1h){:target="\_blank"}, the state's inability to protect the claimant is **relevant** to assess whether the claimant's fear is "well-founded".

	    - [x] False
        > See para 61 of [*Zeah v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*](https://canlii.ca/t/j8csl){:target="\_blank"}. **Delay in seeking refugee protection is not determinative**; rather, it is a factor the decision maker may take into account in assessing the claim's credibility.

    4. What meaning has been ascribed to the term "**persecution**" in international law? 
        - [ ] The sustained or systemic violation of human rights
        - [ ] The sustained or systemic violation of human rights demonstrative of a failure of state protection. 
        - [x] The **sustained or systemic violation** of **basic human rights** demonstrative of **a failure of state protection**.

    6. Mr. Chowdhury is a pro-democracy activist and has been distributing pamphlets on the right to vote. He was arrested for violating public order, which is an offense under the penal code of his country of nationality. This offense carries a sentence of ten years. Because he was arrested for violating the law, he cannot claim that he fears persecution.
	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False
        > This may be a case where the application of **the country's penal code is not in conformity with accepted human rights standards**, since Mr. Chowdhury is facing prosecution for his political opinions. See para 59 of the UNHCR Handbook on *Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status and Guidelines for Protection*.

	    - [x] True
	    - [ ] False
        > See IRB, *Interpretation of the Convention Refugee Definition in the Case Law* (March 31, 2019) chapter 5, section 5.3.1: "Judicial reviews … [f]ar more often … concern claimants who have not met their burden of establishing the subjective component of a well-founded fear because of a credibility issue."

    8. When assessing the claimant's explanation of why they did not make a claim at the first opportunity, a decision-maker should consider the claimant's personal attributes, circumstances, and their understanding of the immigration and refugee process. 
	    - [x] True
	    - [ ] False

    9. Adeline is a member of Minority Group. The documentary evidence shows that members of Minority Group routinely face harassment and discrimination in her country of origin, Oppressive Country. Adeline herself has been denied jobs as a server in a restaurant, spat upon when trying to enter nightclubs, and in one incident was referred to as "hopeless, like all other Minority Group members" by a university professor. The RPD summarized these facts and then analyzed them with a single sentence. It wrote: "None of these incidents by themself amounts to persecution, therefore the claimant is not a Convention refugee." It then moved on to another issue. Which of the following statements best characterizes the RPD's analysis? 
        - [ ] The RPD was correct to find Adeline has not faced persecution. There is no error. 
        - [ ] The RPD made a mistake by failing to consider whether each incident was a sustained or systemic violation of a basic human right demonstrative of a failure of state protection. 
        - [x] The RPD made a mistake by looking at the incidents individually and omitting to consider whether, cumulatively, they amount to persecution.
        - [ ] The RPD made a mistake by failing to consider the issue of state protection.
        > See IRB, Interpretation of the Convention Refugee Definition in the Case Law (March 31, 2019) chapter 3, section 3.1.2: "**[W]here the claimant has experienced more than one incident of mistreatment, the Refugee Protection Division may err if it only looks at each incident separately.**"

    10. According to Professor Hathaway as quoted by the court in Ward v Canada (Minister of Employment & Immigration), if the government was not given an opportunity to respond to harm in circumstances where protection might reasonably have been anticipated, it cannot be said there was a failure of state protection in most cases.

	    - [ ] False

    11. What is the governing question when considering if a delay in claiming refugee protection or asylum undermines a claimant's allegation of having a well-founded fear of persecution?

        - [ ] What is the level of the claimant's education?
        - [x] Did the claimant act in a way that is consistent with the fear of persecution they claim to have?
        - [ ] Did the claimant feel safe in their dealings with their legal representative?

	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False

    13. A refugee claimant is fearing prosecution for a charge of manslaughter in his country of nationality. In assessing his claim and whether that country's law is in conformity with human rights standards, decision-maker would not need to consider the claimant's crime itself.

	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False
        > See IRB, Interpretation of the Convention Refugee Definition in the Case Law (March 31, 2019) chapter 5, section 5.4.2: "**Failure to seek the protection of another country which is also a signatory to the Convention may be a significant factor to consider but is not in itself determinative.**"

    18. If a person's voluntary actions while abroad contributed to the basis of persecution in their country of nationality, then they cannot become a refugee "sur place" as it is aimed to protect persons subject to persecution due to reasons **outside of their control**. 
	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False

    19. A refugee claimant fears persecution in their country of nationality due to their sexual orientation. This claimant has been aware of their sexual orientation since they were 16.

        - [x] When the friend disclosed it to others
        - [ ] When the claimant knew about the cultural intolerance of their sexual orientation
        > The claimant's **fear for persecution crystallized when their secret was no longer safe.** See para 64 of [*Zeah v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*](https://canlii.ca/t/j8csl){:target="\_blank"}, 2020 FC 711.

	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False

    26. Clarke has claimed refugee protection, alleging a fear of being imprisoned because he is homosexual. The documentary evidence reveals that authorities in Clarke's home country only target homosexuals who are open about their sexual orientation. Can it reasonably be found that Mr. Allen faces a well-founded fear of persecution?
