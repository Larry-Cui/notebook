## Notes

??? note "Tutorial notes"

    - Sunday 9:00am.

???+ note "Introduction and Required Readings"

    - we will examine how the Refugee Protection Division, the Refugee Appeal Division, and the courts:
        - Decide which **country** a person’s claim should be assessed against
        - Evaluate whether a claimant has a **well-founded** fear of persecution
        - Decide whether a claimant’s feared persecution has an appropriate **nexus**; that is, whether it is for reasons of race, religion, nationality, membership of a particular social group, or political opinion
        - Decide whether a claimant is unable to **access** state protection in their country of origin; and
        - Decide whether there is **nowhere** in their country of origin that they can live safely, i.e., that they do not have what is called an **internal flight alternative**
