???+ note "Module Content"

    - Two exclusion clauses have been directly incorporated into the IRPA:
        - **Article 1E** excludes persons from refugee protection if they have rights akin to a **permanent resident in some third country**
        - **Article 1F** excludes persons from refugee protection for various forms of **serious domestic and international criminality**
    - It is the responsibility of the government to make the case for exclusion, usually through Minister’s counsel.
    - As the Immigration and Refugee Board’s guide to the Interpretation of the Convention Refugee Definition summarizes, “*[f]or this ground of exclusion to apply, the person must have taken up residence in a country **outside the country of his or her nationality** and have been recognized as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of nationality of that country.*”
    - The Federal Court of Appeal in [*Zeng*](https://canlii.ca/t/29p4n){:target="\_blank"} finds that its concern is to prevent “asylum shopping”.
    - the rationale for article 1F – as explained by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, is that:
        - certain acts are so grave as to render their **perpetrators undeserving of international protection** as refugees. Their primary purpose is to deprive those guilty of heinous acts, and serious common crimes, of international refugee protection and to ensure that such persons do not abuse the institution of asylum in order to avoid being held legally accountable for their acts.
    - Persons who are excluded under article 1F, however, only have access to a **pre-removal risk assessment**, or PRRA, on limited grounds, i.e., under section 97 only. Finally, even if it is determined that a PRRA application should be granted, **a person excluded under article 1F does not get access to permanent residence**; they are only granted a revocable stay (see IRPA, ss 114(1)(b) and (2).)
