???+ note "Module Content"

    - Two exclusion clauses have been directly incorporated into the IRPA:
        - **Article 1E** excludes persons from refugee protection if they have rights akin to a **permanent resident in some third country**
        - **Article 1F** excludes persons from refugee protection for various forms of **serious domestic and international criminality**
    - It is the responsibility of the government to make the case for exclusion, usually through Minister’s counsel.
