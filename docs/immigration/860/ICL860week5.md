???+ note "Module Content"

    - Two exclusion clauses have been directly incorporated into the IRPA:
        - **Article 1E** excludes persons from refugee protection if they have rights akin to a **permanent resident in some third country**
        - **Article 1F** excludes persons from refugee protection for various forms of **serious domestic and international criminality**
    - It is the responsibility of the government to make the case for exclusion, usually through Minister’s counsel.
    - As the Immigration and Refugee Board’s guide to the Interpretation of the Convention Refugee Definition summarizes, “*[f]or this ground of exclusion to apply, the person must have taken up residence in a country **outside the country of his or her nationality** and have been recognized as having the rights and obligations which are attached to the possession of nationality of that country.*”
    - The Federal Court of Appeal in [*Zeng*](https://canlii.ca/t/29p4n){:target="\_blank"} finds that its concern is to prevent “asylum shopping”.
    - the rationale for article 1F – as explained by the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, is that:
        - certain acts are so grave as to render their **perpetrators undeserving of international protection** as refugees. Their primary purpose is to deprive those guilty of heinous acts, and serious common crimes, of international refugee protection and to ensure that such persons do not abuse the institution of asylum in order to avoid being held legally accountable for their acts.
    - Persons who are excluded under article 1F, however, only have access to a **pre-removal risk assessment**, or PRRA, on limited grounds, i.e., under section 97 only. Finally, even if it is determined that a PRRA application should be granted, **a person excluded under article 1F does not get access to permanent residence**; they are only granted a revocable stay (see IRPA, ss 114(1)(b) and (2).)
    - To be excluded under article 1F(b), there must be:
        - **Serious reasons for considering**
        - that **prior to coming to Canada**
        - a person has committed a crime that is **serious** and **non-political**.

    	- [ ] True
	    - [x] False

    2. According to the court in [*Jayasekara v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)*](https://canlii.ca/t/220hq){:target="\_blank"}, after the seriousness of the crime is evaluated, **factors extraneous** to the facts and circumstances underlying the conviction should be balanced against seriousness to determine if the claimant should be excluded from refugee protection. 
    	- [ ] True
	    - [x] False
        > para 44: I believe there is a consensus among the courts that the interpretation of the exclusion clause in Article 1F(b) of the Convention, as regards the seriousness of a crime, requires an evaluation of the elements of the crime, the mode of prosecution, the penalty prescribed, the facts and the mitigating and aggravating circumstances underlying the conviction. ... **There is no balancing, however, with factors extraneous to the facts and circumstances underlying the conviction** such as, for example, the risk of persecution in the state of origin.

    3. In assessing the **seriousness** of a crime, which of the following is considered as held by the court in [*Febles v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*](https://canlii.ca/t/gf3qk){:target="\_blank"}? (Choose all that apply.) 
        - [ ] Whether the crime was committed in Canada or elsewhere.

        - [x] Whether the maximum sentence for the crime in Canada is at least 10 years.
        - [x] Whether the crime is one of the following offences: homicide, rape.
        > Para 62: ... where a maximum sentence of ten years or more could have been imposed had the crime been committed in Canada, the crime will generally be considered serious.  However, ... a claimant whose crime would fall at the less serious end of the range in Canada should not be presumptively excluded.  ... The UNHCR has suggested that a presumption of serious crime might be raised by evidence of commission of any of the following offences: homicide, rape, child molesting, wounding, arson, drugs trafficking, and armed robbery (Goodwin-Gill, at p. 179).

    4. What are the two requirements of the "**incidence" test** for determining if a crime is "**political**" for the purposes of Article 1F(b)?
        - [ ] First, the existence of a Communist government. Second, a rational nexus between the crime committed and the potential establishment of a capitalist economic system. 
        - [ ] First, the presence of a government that would be considered despotic according to Western political ideas. Second, a genuine motivation to overturn the government and install a democracy. 
        - [x] **First**, the existence of a political **disturbance** related to a struggle to modify or abolish a government or a government policy. **Second**, a rational **nexus** between the crime committed and the potential accomplishment of the political objective sought. 
        - [ ] First, the existence of widespread, politically motivated riots. Second, the targeting of the claimant as a leader of the protest movement. 
        > This is the test from *Gil v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)*, [1995] 1 F.C. 508 (C.A.) at 528-529 and 533. For discussion, see IRB, Interpretation of the convention refugee definition in the case law (March 31, 2019), chapters 11 – sections 11.3.4. 

    5. Nathaniel came to Canada and claimed refugee protection, claiming to have been targeted by the husband of a woman whom he loved. At his hearing, he revealed that he had sent indecent pictures of himself to the woman. Based on this information, the RPD is considering whether Nathaniel should be excluded for repeated commission of the criminal offence of Indecent communications, set out in subsection 372(2) of the Criminal Code. Nathaniel's country of origin does not have an offence of Indecent communications. Does the fact that there is no equivalent offence mean he cannot be excluded? 
        -  [ ] Yes
        -  [x] No
        -  [ ] It depends
        > In analyzing the question of exclusion under **Article 1F(b)**, **one should not look at equivalency, but rather the role of ==domestic law== in determining what is "serious."** See IRB, Interpretation of the convention refugee definition in the case law (March 31, 2019), chapters 11 – sections 11.3.2

    6. In *Febles v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, the Supreme Court of Canada adopted Professor Hathaway's view that Article 1F(b) is confined to accused persons who are fugitives from prosecution. 
    	- [ ] True
	    - [x] False

    7. Jimbo came to Canada and claimed refugee protection. After making his claim, he robbed a bank in downtown Ottawa. Can he be excluded from refugee protection under Article 1F(b)?  
        - [ ] Yes
        - [x] No
        - [ ] It depends

    8. According to the Federal Court of Appeal in *Jayasekara v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)*, which of the following should be evaluated in relation to the **seriousness** of a crime:
        - [ ] Elements of the crime, whether the accused had counsel during criminal trial, the mode of prosecution, the penalty prescribed 
        - [x] **Elements of the crime, the mode of prosecution, the penalty prescribed, mitigating facts, aggravating circumstances**
        - [ ] Elements of the crime, whether the accused had counsel during criminal trial, the mode of prosecution, mitigating facts surrounding the crime

    9. In *Febles v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, the Supreme Court of Canada held that Article 1F(b) serves **one main purpose** – to exclude from refugee protection persons who have committed a serious crime. 
    	- [x] True
	    - [ ] False

    10. Nathaniel came to Canada and claimed refugee protection, claiming to have been targeted by the husband of a woman whom he loved. At his hearing, he revealed that he had sent indecent pictures of himself to the woman "about 10 times". Based on this information, the RPD is considering whether Nathaniel should be excluded for commission of the criminal offence of "Indecent communications", set out in subsection 372(2) of the Criminal Code. The offence carries with it a maximum term of imprisonment of 2 years, however, the RPD member tells Nathaniel's counsel that he believes the repeated nature of Nathaniel's offence renders the crimes serious within the meaning of Article 1F(b). Is the RPD member right that they may consider the repeated nature of the offence as a factor in determining "seriousness"?  
        - [x] Yes
        - [ ] No
        - [ ] It depends
