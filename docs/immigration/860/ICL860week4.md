??? note "Nexus to a Convention Ground"

    - The fear of persecution must be “for reasons of” one of the five Convention grounds. This is commonly referred to as the **“nexus”** requirement.:
        - Race
        - Religion
        - Nationality
        - Membership in a particular social group 
        - Political opinion



## Quizzes

???+ note "Nexus, with a Focus on Membership in a Particular Social Group, Political Opinion"

    1. A refugee claimant has previously belonged to a terrorist group. The terrorist group no longer exists. Under the Supreme Court's decision in *Ward*, the claimant would not receive refugee protection under the "particular social group" definition. 
	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False
        > The SCC did not adopt FCA's holding that **"particular social group" should be limited in scope to exclude claimants that have embraced terrorists**. Such persons, however, may face a strong likelihood of exclusion under article 1F(a) of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.

    2. In *Tobias Gomez v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, why did the court conclude that the claimant's actions did not fall under "political opinion"? 
        - [ ] The claimant was resisting a criminal gang, not the government, and hence their actions could not be the basis of a "political opinion". 
        - [x] The claimant did not provide evidence showing their resistance to extortion was **amounted to a political conviction** or was viewed as such by the gang. 
        - [ ] The claimant had expressed the same opinion regarding the gang as the government, and therefore, his was not a dissenting "political opinion." 
        - [ ] The claimant did not advance the claim for "political opinion" before the IRB. 

    3. In cases where a certain political opinion was wrongly imputed to a claimant, they may nonetheless succeed in their claim for refugee protection. 
	    - [x] True
	    - [ ] False
        > In *Ward v Canada (Minister of Employment & Immigration)* (QL), Justice LaForest held the political opinion ascribed to the claimant, leading to their fear of persecution, **need not necessarily conform to the claimant's true beliefs**. See para 83.

    4. According to *Tobias Gomez v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, the claimant bears the onus to bring evidence showing their actions amounted to a political conviction, or that it can be construed as such by the persecutor. 
	    - [x] True
	    - [ ] False

    5. The fact that violence against women is common in Canada is relevant when considering whether a claim based on gender-based violence can succeed before the RPD or RAD. 
	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False
        > See section B of the IRB, Chairperson Guidlines 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution (November 13, 1996): "The fact that violence, including sexual and domestic violence, **against women is universal is irrelevant** when determining whether rape, and other gender-specific crimes constitute forms of persecution. The real issues are whether the violence -- experienced or feared -- is a serious violation of a fundamental human right for a Convention ground."

    6. A refugee claimant who is successful in establishing they fall within the definition of "Convention refugee" will be granted refugee protection regardless of their past political or criminal conduct. 
	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False
        > A claimant who has established they are included in the definition of "Convention refugee" must still show that they are **not subject to inadmissibility for criminality or exclusion** under article 1E or 1F of the 1951 Convention.

    7. Assume the following facts are established on a balance of probabilities: Fantine is a member of a minority ethnic group. Most members of her ethnic group also belong to a minority religion. They also speak a minority language. Female members of the ethnic group are routinely targeted for sexual violence by members of the military. Which of the following statements best characterizes Fantine's claim?
        - [x] We need more facts to decide whether Fantine is a Convention refugee.
        - [ ] Fantine may establish her claim under each of the Convention grounds. 
        - [ ] Fantine may not establish her claim because no one Convention ground can be said to substantially contribute to her well-founded fear of persecution. 
        - [ ] Fantine may establish her claim based on race, nationality, religion and membership in a particular social group, but not based on political opinion. 
        > Although Fantine's claim potentially has a nexus to four different Convention grounds --  as suggested by D – we need to know more about why Fantine herself was targeted before coming to a conclusion about which Convention ground applies. 

    8. The Court in *Klinko v Canada*, [2000] 3 FC 327 (CA) held that a political opinion ceases to be political when the ruling government agrees with such opinion. 
	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False
        > See para 31 of the decision. 

    9. The Convention ground of "race" refers only to "race" in the biological sense. 
	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False

    10. Assume the following facts are established on a balance of probabilities: A refugee claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution due to complaints he has made to authorities about government officials demanding bribes. The government has made formal announcements about its plans to crack down corruption. Would this claimant's claim succeed under the "political opinion" ground? 
        - [ ] No. The claimant's opinion is not in opposition to the government. 
        - [ ] No. Filing complaints with authorities is not vocally expressing a political opinion.
        - [ ] Yes. A political opinion does not depend on the government's agreement.
        - [x] Maybe. If corruption is widespread enough, then denouncing the corruption can be an expression of "political opinion". 
        > See *Klinko v Canada*, [2000] 3 FC 327 (CA) at paras 34-35: "I have no doubt that the widespread government corruption raised by the claimant's opinion is a 'matter in which the machinery of state, government, and policy may be engaged' … Where, as in this case, the corrupt elements so permeate the government as to be part of its very fabric, **a denunciation of the existing corruption is an expression of 'political opinion'**. "
