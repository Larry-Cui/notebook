??? note "module content"

    - The fear of persecution must be “for reasons of” one of the five Convention grounds. This is commonly referred to as the **“nexus”** requirement.:
        - Race
        - Religion
        - Nationality
        - Membership in a particular social group 
        - Political opinion
    - Failure to rebut the **presumption of state protection** or to show the absence of **an internal flight alternative** are common grounds for rejecting refugee protection claims.
    - Once more, *Ward* is a crucial case on state protection, as are *Hinzman* and *Flores & Carillo*. Meanwhile, *Thirunavukkarasu* is a leading case setting out the test for determining whether there is an internal flight alternative.


## Quizzes

??? note "Nexus, with a Focus on Membership in a Particular Social Group, Political Opinion"

    1. A refugee claimant has previously belonged to a terrorist group. The terrorist group no longer exists. Under the Supreme Court's decision in *Ward*, the claimant would not receive refugee protection under the "particular social group" definition. 
	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False
        > The SCC did not adopt FCA's holding that **"particular social group" should be limited in scope to exclude claimants that have embraced terrorists**. Such persons, however, may face a strong likelihood of exclusion under article 1F(a) of the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees.

    2. In *Tobias Gomez v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, why did the court conclude that the claimant's actions did not fall under "political opinion"? 
        - [ ] The claimant was resisting a criminal gang, not the government, and hence their actions could not be the basis of a "political opinion". 
        - [x] The claimant did not provide evidence showing their resistance to extortion was **amounted to a political conviction** or was viewed as such by the gang. 
        - [ ] The claimant had expressed the same opinion regarding the gang as the government, and therefore, his was not a dissenting "political opinion." 
        - [ ] The claimant did not advance the claim for "political opinion" before the IRB. 

    3. In cases where a certain political opinion was wrongly imputed to a claimant, they may nonetheless succeed in their claim for refugee protection. 
	    - [x] True
	    - [ ] False
        > In *Ward v Canada (Minister of Employment & Immigration)* (QL), Justice LaForest held the political opinion ascribed to the claimant, leading to their fear of persecution, **need not necessarily conform to the claimant's true beliefs**. See para 83.

    4. According to *Tobias Gomez v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, the claimant bears the onus to bring evidence showing their actions amounted to a political conviction, or that it can be construed as such by the persecutor. 
	    - [x] True
	    - [ ] False

    5. The fact that violence against women is common is relevant when considering whether a claim based on gender-based violence can succeed before the RPD or RAD. 
	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False
        > See section B of the IRB, Chairperson Guidlines 4: Women Refugee Claimants Fearing Gender-Related Persecution (November 13, 1996): "The fact that violence, including sexual and domestic violence, **against women is universal is irrelevant** when determining whether rape, and other gender-specific crimes constitute forms of persecution. The real issues are whether the violence -- experienced or feared -- is a serious violation of a fundamental human right for a Convention ground."

    6. A refugee claimant who is successful in establishing they fall within the definition of "Convention refugee" will be granted refugee protection regardless of their past political or criminal conduct. 
	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False
        > A claimant who has established they are included in the definition of "Convention refugee" must still show that they are **not subject to inadmissibility for criminality or exclusion** under article 1E or 1F of the 1951 Convention.

    7. Assume the following facts are established on a balance of probabilities: Fantine is a member of a minority ethnic group. Most members of her ethnic group also belong to a minority religion. They also speak a minority language. Female members of the ethnic group are routinely targeted for sexual violence by members of the military. Which of the following statements best characterizes Fantine's claim?
        - [x] We need more facts to decide whether Fantine is a Convention refugee.
        - [ ] Fantine may establish her claim under each of the Convention grounds. 
        - [ ] Fantine may not establish her claim because no one Convention ground can be said to substantially contribute to her well-founded fear of persecution. 
        - [ ] Fantine may establish her claim based on race, nationality, religion and membership in a particular social group, but not based on political opinion. 
        > Although Fantine's claim potentially has a nexus to four different Convention grounds --  as suggested by D – we need to know more about **why Fantine herself was targeted** before coming to a conclusion about which Convention ground applies. 

    8. The Court in *Klinko v Canada*, [2000] 3 FC 327 (CA) held that a political opinion ceases to be political when the ruling government agrees with such opinion. 
	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False
        > See para 31 of the decision. 

    9. The Convention ground of "race" refers only to "race" in the biological sense. 
	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False

    10. Assume the following facts are established on a balance of probabilities: A refugee claimant has a well-founded fear of persecution due to complaints he has made to authorities about government officials demanding bribes. The government has made formal announcements about its plans to crack down corruption. Would this claimant's claim succeed under the "political opinion" ground? 
        - [ ] No. The claimant's opinion is not in opposition to the government. 
        - [ ] No. Filing complaints with authorities is not vocally expressing a political opinion.
        - [ ] Yes. A political opinion does not depend on the government's agreement.
        - [x] Maybe. If corruption is widespread enough, then denouncing the corruption can be an expression of "political opinion". 
        > See *Klinko v Canada*, [2000] 3 FC 327 (CA) at paras 34-35: "I have no doubt that the widespread government corruption raised by the claimant's opinion is a 'matter in which the machinery of state, government, and policy may be engaged' … Where, as in this case, the corrupt elements so permeate the government as to be part of its very fabric, **a denunciation of the existing corruption is an expression of 'political opinion'**. "

    11. The evidence in a claim establishes the following on a balance of probabilities: Gemma has been singled out for arrest after publishing a leaflet. In it, she criticized the ruling political party's arrest and torture of homosexuals. Gemma is homosexual, but the authorities do not believe she is. Assuming there are no further relevant facts, which of the following statements best characterizes the nature of her claim? Choose one. 
        - [ ] Gemma can claim a well-founded fear of persecution because of her political opinion. 
        - [ ] Gemma can claim a well-founded fear of persecution because of her membership in a particular social group.
        - [x] Gemma can claim a well-founded fear of persecution because of **her political opinion and her membership** in a particular social group.
        - [ ] Gemma can claim a well-founded fear of persecution because of her political opinion or her membership in a particular social group, but not both. 

    12. The evidence in a claim establishes the following on a balance of probabilities: Gemma has been singled out for arrest after publishing a leaflet. In it, she criticized the ruling political party's arrest and torture of homosexuals. Gemma is not homosexual, and the authorities do not believe she is homosexual. Assuming there are no further relevant facts, **can Gemma claim a well-founded fear of persecution because of her political opinion**? 
        - [x] Yes
        - [ ] No
        - [ ] It depends
        > 

    13. *Femenia v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)*, [1995] F.C.J. No. 1455 (T.D.) (QL) clarified the meaning of "engaged" as meaning "sanctioned by, condoned by, or supported by". The Federal Court of Appeal in *Klinko v Canada*, [2000] 3 FC 327 (CA) stated that *Femenia* is consistent with the Supreme Court's decision in Ward. 
	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False
        > The Court in *Klinko* held that the meaning given to the word "engaged" in *Femenia* is inconsistent with the law as set forth in *Ward*. See paras 24-25 of the decision. 

    14. For a claimant to establish that their well-founded fear of persecution is due to their political opinion, they must have expressed their opinion in words.
	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False
        > In *Ward*, Justice LaForest explained that some claimants may not have the opportunity to articulate their beliefs, but their beliefs can be perceived from their actions. **The absence of expression in words** may make it more difficult for the claimant to establish the relationship between their political opinion and the feared persecution, but it **does not preclude protection** of the claimant. See para 82 of Ward v Canada (Minister of Employment & Immigration) (QL). 

    15. In *Ward*, the court was not worried that it was making refugee protection too widely available by defining political opinion to include any dissent against any organization because: 
        - [ ] The claimant's political opinion must be grounded in their words and/or actions. 
        - [ ] The claimant must subjectively fear persecution.
        - [x] The claimant's dissent must be **rooted in an actual or imputed political conviction**.
        - [ ] The persecuting organization must correctly believe the claimant held the opposing political beliefs. 

    16. In Ward, Justice LaForest held that "particular social group" is broadly defined, aiming to catch possible gaps in the other enumerated grounds for persecution in the Convention refugee definition.
	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False
        > See paragraph 59 of *Ward v Canada (Minister of Employment & Immigration)* (QL).

    17.  In *Ward*, the SCC held that the members of the INLA do not constitute a "particular social group" because: 
        - [x] Using violent methods to achieve independence from the UK is not essential to members' human dignity. 
        - [ ] The members joined INLA voluntarily, without any coercion. 
        - [ ] The INLA disbanded and therefore cannot persecute individuals. 
        - [ ] The INLA did not have a legitimate lawful objective. 
        > See para 79 of *Ward v Canada (Minister of Employment & Immigration)* (QL). There, Justice LaForest held that, although the fight for independence from the United Kingdom and unification with the Irish Republic may be very serious political ends for INLA members, *requiring them to abandon violence would not amount to an abdication of their human dignity*. 

    18. In *Tobias Gomez v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, why was the objective evidence showing those who resist gangs in El Salvador may be subject to retribution not sufficient to support a finding that there was a nexus to the political opinion? 
        - [ ] The claimant also needed to show evidence of their own actual resistance to the criminal gangs. 
        - [ ] Because the Mara-18 is a criminal gang and not the government, and therefore the claimant's resistance would not be "political opinion." 
        - [x] Documentary evidence did not suggest the Mara-18 saw resistance to them as a **political stand**. 
        - [ ] Because the claimant did not seek state protection, which would have been an avenue for them to express their political opinion. 

    19. Which of the following groups have been recognized as particular **social groups** by the courts? Click on all that apply. 
        - [x] Men victimized by the former abusive partner of their spouse
        - [x] Abandoned children
        - [x] Trade unions
        - [ ] Members of a cooperative of taxi drivers
        - [x] The poor
        - [ ] Haitian citizens returning home after a stay abroad

    20. Whether or not a nexus has been established must be evaluated from whose perspective? 
        - [ ] The RPD or RAD.
        - [ ] The refugee protection claimant. 
        - [x] The agent of persecution.
        - [ ] An impartial spectator, as set out in Adam Smith's The Theory of Moral Sentiments. 
        > See *Ward v Canada (Minister of Employment & Immigration)* (QL) at para 83.

    21. The Convention ground of "nationality" may include which of the following? Click on all that apply. 
        - [x] Nationality in the sense of "citizenship"
        - [x] Nationality in the sense of "ethnic group"
        - [x] Nationality in the sense of "linguistic group"
        - [x] Race
        > See UNHCR, Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status and Guidelines for Protection (Geneva: UNHCR, 2019) at para 74. Note that it is written that "[w]hen used as one of the five grounds, 'nationality' does not mean the same thing as 'citizenship'" in chapter 4 of the IRB's Interpretation of the Convention Refugee Definition in the Case Law (March 31, 2019) at section 4.3. However, the point being made there is that the meaning of **"nationality" is broader than simply citizenship**. 

    22. Which of the following is **NOT** a category under the test for "particular social group" as adopted by the court in Ward v Canada (Minister of Employment & Immigration)? Click on all that apply.
        - [ ] Groups defined by an immutable or unchangeable characteristic. 
        - [ ] Groups of persons associated with one another for reasons fundamental to their human dignity. 
        - [ ] Groups associated by former voluntary status.
        - [x] Groups who have been together for a long time, like the Rolling Stones. 

    23. In *Ward*, although it was held that INLA is not a "particular social group", the court agreed that the applicant's fear was based on his membership with the INLA.  
	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False
        > **The Court did not accept that the applicant's fear was based on his membership**. It found *Ward* was the target of "a highly individualized form of persecution". See para 79 of the decision. 

    24. For an opinion to count as a **"political" opinion**, it must:
        - [ ] Concern a political party – in or out of power – or any law, policy, or decision supported by that party.
        - [x] **Concern a matter in which the machinery of state, government, and policy may be engaged**.
        - [ ] Concern a matter in which the machinery of state, government, and policy or any powerful non-state group in society may be engaged. 
        - [ ] Concern the interests and power of the members of the political and economic elite.

    25. According to the UNHCR Handbook, as referenced in Ward, the refugee claimant must **raise all potential reasons** for persecution in order for the decision-maker to decide whether the "Convention refugee" definition is met. 
	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False
        > The court notes that the UNHCR Handbook on Procedures and Criteria for Determining Refugee Status at paragraph 66 states that it is not the duty of a claimant to identify the reasons for the persecution. **It is for the examiner to decide whether the Convention definition is met.** See para 80 of *Ward v Canada (Minister of Employment & Immigration)* (QL). 

    26. The evidence in a claim establishes the following on a balance of probabilities: Hiram belongs to a minority religion whose members face a reasonable chance of persecution. His religion does not require public worship or other public manifestations of belief (including forms of dress). Hiram could therefore continue to practice his religion without publicly revealing it. Which of the following statements best characterizes the nature of her claim? Choose one. 
        - [ ] Hiram does not face a well-founded fear of persecution since he can practice his religion without revealing it. 
        - [ ] Hiram faces a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of his religion even his religion remains unknown. 
        - [ ] Hiram faces a well-founded fear of persecution for reasons of his religion because there is a reasonable chance it may become known.
        - [x] We do not have enough facts to answer this question. 
        > What is needed are facts about **how likely it is that Hiram's religious affiliation might become known even though he need not reveal it.** Otherwise, the facts do not reveal any persecution of Hiram; in particular, because his faith requires no public worship or other manifestations, he is not being asked to conceal it. 

    27. The Court in *Klinko v Canada*, [2000] 3 FC 327 (CA) held that to establish a nexus based on **political opinion**, it is sufficient that **the state or machinery of state "may be engaged"** in the issue that is the subject of the opinion. 
	    - [x] True
	    - [ ] False

    28. Patricia comes from the country of Phionia where criminality, including rape, is widespread. The police are largely ineffective. There is no question that Patricia is at risk. However, in deciding her claim, the RPD member writes: "Both men and women from Phionia face a risk of criminality, therefore the claimant has not established a nexus to a Convention ground." ==This was an error.==
	    - [x] True
	    - [ ] False
        > While for a time the case law was inconsistent, in 2010 the Federal Court definitively stated **it is an error to dismiss gender-based violence as a mere incidence of generalized criminality**: *Dezameau v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, 2010 FC 559; *Josile v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, 2011 FC 39. However, a claimant must nonetheless establish that they are **personally at risk**. 

??? note "State Protection and Internal Flight Alternative"

    1. Where the state itself is the alleged agent of persecution, a claimant may not need to exhaust all recourses to rebut the presumption of state protection. In fact, the presumption does not apply. 
	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False
        > See *Hinzman v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, [2007 FCA 171](https://canlii.ca/t/1rb2c){:target="\_blank"} at paragraphs 53-54. "... The presumption of state protection described in Ward, therefore, **applies equally to cases** where an individual claims to fear persecution by non-state entities and to cases where the state is alleged to be a persecutor."

    2. According to *Ward*, a claimant must have approached the state for protection in order to show the state's inability to protect the claimant. 
	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False
        > See para 49 of *Canada (Attorney General) v. Ward*, [1993] S.C.J. No. 74 (QL): The claimant will not meet the definition of "Convention refugee" where it is objectively unreasonable for the claimant not to have sought the protection of his home authorities; otherwise, **the claimant need not literally approach the state**. 

    3. The RPD issues written reasons rejecting a claim for protection by Jan, a member of Oppressed Group from Country. After setting out various legislative initiatives and government announcements, the RPD concludes that the country has made "serious efforts" to provide adequate protection to members of Oppressed Group, such as Jan. It therefore concludes that Jan has not rebutted the presumption of state protection. Based on these facts, which statement below best characterizes the RPD's decision? 
        - [ ] The decision is likely correct because the standard of protection is not perfection.
        - [x] The decision is likely in error because it considered only government's efforts to provide protection **without inquiring into whether its efforts had achieved operational adequacy**. 
        - [ ] The decision is likely in correct because to go beyond the inquiry into serious efforts would shift the burden onto the RPD to prove adequate state protection. However, the onus is always on the claimant to establish each element of their claim.
        - [ ] The decision is likely in error because the standard is not whether protection is "adequate" but whether Jan faces a reasonable chance of persecution on a Convention ground. 

    4. Which of the following is true about the principle of "internal flight alternative" as mentioned in *Thirunavukkarasu v Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)*? (select all that apply)
        - [ ] The decision-maker should ask whether, given the persecution in the claimant's part of the country, is it subjectively reasonable to expect them to seek safety in another part of the country before pursuing a refugee claim in Canada. 
        - [x] An internal flight alternative must be **realistic**, not just speculative or theoretical.
        - [x] Someone escaping persecution should not be expected to live in an **isolated part** of their country (such as a "cave in the mountains, or in a desert or a jungle") to seek safety.
        - [ ] A claimant may be expected to relocate to an internal flight alternative even if they would encounter great physical danger in travelling or staying there. 

    5. In *Hinzman v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)*, 2007 FCA 171 the court held that because the U.S. is a democratic country with balances among its three branches of government, the claimant's evidentiary burden is high to rebut the presumption that the U.S. is capable of protecting its citizen. 
	    - [x] True
	    - [ ] False

    6. The requirement to rebut the presumption of state protection is an independent criterion for establishing that a claimant is a refugee. 
	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False
        > See also IRB, Interpretation of the Convention Refugee Definition in the Case Law (March 31, 2019) chapter 6, section 6.1: "… the state's ability to protect the claimant is a crucial element in **determining whether the fear of persecution is well founded**, and as such, is **not an independent element** of the definition."

    7. As mentioned in *Flores Carrillo v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)*, 2008 FCA 94, what is the standard of proof assumed by the claimant to show that **state protection is inadequate**? 
        - [ ] Reasonable grounds to believe.
        - [ ] Beyond a reasonable doubt.
        - [x] Balance of probabilities.
        - [ ] Reasonable possibility. 

    8. According to *Flores Carrillo v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)*, 2008 FCA 94 the claimant must convince the trier of fact that the evidence establishes that state protection is inadequate. What is this burden called? 
        - [ ] Evidentiary burden. 
        - [x] **Legal burden of persuasion**.
        - [ ] Balance of probabilities.
        - [ ] Legal evidentiary burden.

    9. Justice LaForest in *Ward* rejected the idea that there should be a presumption of state protection. He reasoned that such a presumption would render refugee protection a false promise.
	    - [ ] True
	    - [x] False

    10. Which of the following factors are to be considered in the contextual approach to state protection? Click on all that apply.
