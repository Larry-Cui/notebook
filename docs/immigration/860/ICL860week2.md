??? note "Introduction"

    - One of three ways to become a protected person under the IRPA is to make a refugee protection **claim in Canada**. If found eligible, refugee protection claims are decided by the Immigration and Refugee Board (or IRB), more specifically the two divisions of the Board that deal with refugee matters – the **Refugee Protection Division (or RPD)** and the **Refugee Appeal Division (or RAD)**.
