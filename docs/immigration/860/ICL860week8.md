???+ note "Module Content"

    - two subjects: The framework for refugee **resettlement** and the rights of persons recognized as **protected persons** under the IRPA.
    - A person granted protected person status may lose that status, when it is either “**cessated**” or “**vacated**” by the **Refugee Protection Division**. Cessation, as we will see, governs cases where the government alleges a protected person’s behaviour indicates they **no longer need protection**. Vacation applies where the government seeks to prove that refugee protection status was granted due to **misrepresentation or the withholding of material facts**.
