??? note "Module Introduction"

    - two subjects: The framework for refugee **resettlement** and the rights of persons recognized as **protected persons** under the IRPA.
    - A person granted protected person status may lose that status, when it is either “**cessated**” or “**vacated**” by the **Refugee Protection Division**. Cessation, as we will see, governs cases where the government alleges a protected person’s behaviour indicates they **no longer need protection**. Vacation applies where the government seeks to prove that refugee protection status was granted due to **misrepresentation or the withholding of material facts**.

??? note "Resettlement"

    - the statutory framework for resettlement is set out in the IRPA and the Regulations, and their application is explained in the operational instructions.
    - **What are eligibility and substantive criteria for being accepted as a refugee for resettlement?** 
        - Here you should focus on IRPR, ss 139 and 144-147.
        - 139(1): outside Canada, submitted an application, intention to come to Canada permanently, cannot resettle in habitual residence or repatriate to country of nationality, having sponsor, financial assistance from Canada or funds available by themselves, successfully established ability
        - 145: A foreign national is a Convention refugee abroad and a member of **the Convention refugees abroad class** if the foreign national has been determined, outside Canada, **by an officer** to be a Convention refugee.
        - 147: A foreign national is a member of **the country of asylum class** if they have been determined **by an officer** to be in need of resettlement because
            - (a) they are outside all of their countries of nationality and habitual residence; and
            - (b) they have been, and continue to be, seriously and personally affected by civil war, armed conflict or massive violation of human rights in each of those countries.
    - **What are the requirements for sponsorship of resettlement applicants?** 
        - Here you should focus on IRPR, ss 140.2, 152-158, as well as IRPA 13-13.2.
        - A13(1): A Canadian citizen or permanent resident, or a group of Canadian citizens or permanent residents, a corporation incorporated under a law of Canada or of a province or an unincorporated organization or association under federal or provincial law — or any combination of them — may **sponsor a foreign national**, subject to the regulations.
        - 153(1): a sponsor must: reside in the community, make a sponsorship application, not default in the past. 
        - 153(1.2): the sponsor must send the **sponsorship application** and the **application for a permanent resident visa** to the Department’s **Case Processing Centre in Canada for processing** those applications.
        - 156(1) **Ineligibility to sponsor**: convicted, default any support payment, removal order, citizenship revocated, detained. 
    - [***Ha v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)***](https://canlii.ca/t/1gcfx){:target="\_blank"}, (2004) 3 FC 195, 2004 FCA 49, Paragraphs 9-19, 46, 66-68
        - is a key case on procedural fairness in resettlement applications. In its decision, the Federal Court of Appeal applied the **five *Baker* factors** to determine that procedural fairness mandates that **counsel should be allowed to attend resettlement interviews**. In the analysis of those factors, we recommend you focus on the nature of the decision being made by the visa officer and the rights of counsel during the interview. Is the decision a predominantly legal one, or is it characterized by considerable discretion? What purposes may be served by having counsel attend the resettlement interview?
    - [***Helal v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***](https://canlii.ca/t/hx1bx){:target="\_blank"}, 2019 FC 37, Paragraphs 15-23
        - is a more recent case concerning procedural fairness in a resettlement application. The Federal Court found that – notwithstanding ***Ha*** – the procedural fairness owed to foreign nationals seeking entry to Canada is “**at the lower end of the spectrum**” (para 18). It goes on to consider whether there was a breach of procedural fairness in that case. Here we recommend asking yourself: What was the alleged breach of procedural fairness? What principle did the Court use to resolve the issue?
    - [***Anku v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***](https://canlii.ca/t/jd2qg){:target="\_blank"}, 2021 FC 125
        - discusses several, cross-cutting errors in an officer’s decision on a resettlement. This aspect of the decision is helpful for its break down of the nature of the decision that must be made by an officer. Later, the court zeroes in on the issue of whether or not the applicants’ had a “durable solution” and so failed to meet the requirements of IRPR, s 139(1)(d) (which requires that a foreign national must be “a person in respect of which there is no reasonable prospect, within a reasonable period, of a durable solution in a country other than Canada”). The court affirmed that **an evaluation of whether there is a durable solution is “a highly contextual exercise, driven by the facts”** (para 30). Here we recommend you consider comparing the court’s discussion of this issue with the discussion of durable solutions in the IRCC operations manual.
    - **Scenario 1:** It is 2011. The principal applicant is a widow and citizen of Afghanistan. Her application includes her three adult sons, their wives and children (the principal applicant’s grandchildren). The family left Afghanistan in 1993 after the Mujahadeen took over the country and the principal applicant’s son was injured in an attack. They fled the country and have lived in a refugee camp in Pakistan since then. The applicants are from Kabul, which in 2011 was under government control and enjoyed relative stability. They do not have any family members in Afghanistan. Are the applicants members of either the Convention refugees abroad class or the Country of asylum class?
        - **Likely not.** To be a member of the Convention refugees abroad class, an applicant must “have been determined, outside Canada, by an officer to be a Convention refugee” (IRPR, s 145). However, the facts as described to do not disclose a fear of persecution for a Convention reason (recall the requirements from Module 3). To be a member of the Country of asylum class, an applicant must have been determined by an officer to be **in need of resettlement because** (a) they are **outside** all of their countries of nationality and habitual residence; and (b) they have been, and continue to be, seriously and personally **affected by civil war, armed conflict or massive violation of human rights** in each of those countries (IRPR, s 147). However, the relative stability of Kabul indicates that they do not continue to be seriously and personally affected by the civil war, armed conflict or human rights violations that plagued Afghanistan for so long.
    - **Scenario 2:** The principal applicant has lived in South Africa with refugee status for 14 years with his wife and their four children. All of them are citizens of Ethiopia. The principal applicant has been the victim of several burglaries, losing items such as a television set and 15,000 Rand stolen from a box under his sofa, as well as other items and amounts. The principal applicant has a business. His children are all entitled to attend public school. The principal applicant says that he and his family are the victims of discrimination, including at school. He says they are targeted by burglars also because they are foreigners. The principal applicant’s first cousin and some other individuals sponsored his application. Does the principal applicant and his family have a durable solution in South Africa? 
        - **Likely yes.** Note that there is no precise definition of “**durable solution**.” Whether someone has a durable solution is a “**highly contextual exercise, driven by the facts” (Anku, para 30)**. IRPR, s 139(d) refers to two types of durable solution – **voluntary repatriation and resettlement.** IRCC’s operational instructions also refer to a third – **local integration** (presumably subsumed under “resettlement”). Here, local integration in South Africa is candidate durable solution. The instructions indicate that “[l]ocal integration allows the refugee to live permanently in safety and dignity in the country of refuge and partake of its enduring legal, economic and social benefits.” Determining whether local integration has or can occurred “requires careful analysis … of both country conditions, the applicant’s individual circumstances and a comparison of these circumstances” to the instructions. **Among the indicators of local integration are “long-term residency” and “access to participate in society.”** In this case, it is not clear whether the principal applicant and his family have access to long-term residency. The severity of the discrimination is not clear either. However, the principal applicant has a business, and his children have access to schooling. Unless their status is precarious (leading to a fear of refoulement) and the discrimination is serious, they likely at least have access to at least de facto local integration.
    - **Scenario 3:** The applicant is a citizen of Eritrea who was accepted as a refugee in Italy in 2015. In Italy, the applicant alleges she experiences discrimination, racism, and exploitation as a single female refugee. She works long hours (50+ hours a week) as a factory worker, facing harassment, verbal and physical abuse, and inappropriate touching. The applicant has three children who currently live in Ethiopia with an aunt. She says it would be easier to reunite with them and care for them in Canada because there she would have her sponsors’ help. Her sponsors are a group of her relatives. Is the applicant entitled to a permanent resident visa because she is in need of refugee protection? 
        - **Likely not.** The applicant’s circumstances in Italy, while difficult, do not indicate that she does not have a durable solution there. However, Desloges & Sawicki notes (at 513) that: “**In the event of an ineligibility problem, section 25 of the IRPA affords officers the broad discretion to ‘grant the foreign national permanent resident status…’**” Note that section 25 requires that the “best interests of a child directly affected” be taken into account. In this case, the applicant could request that the officer take into account the best interests of her children, including their chances of reuniting with their mother and the increased support they would get from the applicant’s relatives in Canada.

??? note "Cessation and Vacation"

    - These are two ways that a person who has been granted refugee protection may lose their status as protected persons **on application by the Minister**.
        - **Cessation** applies when a person no longer needs protection. 
        - **Vacation** applies when a person obtained protection through fraudulent means.
    - Cessation can occur either because circumstances in a person’s country of origin have **changed** or because the person has taken certain actions that indicate they are **not at risk**. Specifically, section 108 of the IRPA, applies when a person:
        - Has voluntarily “**re-availed**” themselves of the protection of their country of nationality;
        - Has voluntarily **reacquired** their nationality;
        - Has acquired a new nationality and enjoys the protection of the country of that nationality;
        - Has voluntarily become **re-established** in the country that the person left or remained outside of and in respect of which the person claimed refugee protection in Canada; or
        - The **reasons** for which the person sought refugee protection have **ceased to exist**.
    - the last ground for cessation does not apply under subsection 108(4) “if there are **compelling reasons** arising out of previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment for refusing to avail themselves of the protection of the country which they left”.
    - If the Minister’s application is accepted, the person’s claim is deemed to have been rejected. If the person was a permanent resident, they will lose permanent resident status under paragraph **46(1)(c.1)** of the IRPA (unless the application is allowed under paragraph 108(1)(e) for a change in circumstances) and will be deemed inadmissible under section 40.1.
    - [***Nsende v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)***](https://canlii.ca/t/1wrls){:target="\_blank"}, 2008 FC 531
        - ***Nsende*** addresses the interpretation of paragraph 108(1)(a) of the IRPA, cessation because of **voluntary re-availment**. As the IRB’s guide indicates, **paragraph 108(1)(a) is the most frequently invoked ground of cessation**. In reading the case, you should ask yourself: What are the requirements for establishing re-availment? What role does intention play?
    - Vacation applies when a person is found to have obtained refugee protection **fraudulently**. subsection **109(1)** of the IRPA states:
        - The Refugee Protection Division may, **on application by the Minister**, vacate a decision to allow a claim for refugee protection, if it finds that the decision was obtained as a result of directly or indirectly misrepresenting or withholding **material facts** relating to a relevant matter.
    - If the Minister’s application is accepted, the decision that conferred protection is “nullified” under paragraph 109(3). 
        - If they were a **permanent resident**, the person who is the subject of the decision **loses** that status under paragraph 46(1)(d) of the IRPA. A person whose status has been vacated will be deemed **inadmissible** under paragraph 40(1)(c) of the IRPA. 
        - Although citizenship is not covered in this course, a successful application for vacation can also lead to **loss of citizenship** under sections 10 and 10.1 of the Citizenship Act (R.S.C. 1985, c. C-29).
    - [***Coomaraswamy v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)***](https://canlii.ca/t/4j7t){:target="\_blank"}, 2002 FCA 153, Paragraphs 1-7, 9-30, 42
        - This is an important case that establishes many key principles for applying section 109. In reading this case, we suggest that you focus on the different ways a person might resist a vacation application and, in particular, what evidence they may rely on.
    - [***Mella v. Canada (Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness)***](https://canlii.ca/t/j3wnl){:target="\_blank"}, 2019 FC 1587 (CanLII), 1-22, 26-42: 
        - ***Mella*** is a recent case in which the Court dealt with a number of “equitable” challenges to a vacation application: duress, “innocence” of misrepresentation, or abuse of process by the Minister (in this case, in the form of a delay of about 10 years) in bringing an application.
    - Cessation Scenario 1: Thelonious Musque was granted refugee protection in 1998, at the age of 14. Five years later, he applied and was accepted into the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. After four years, he graduated summa cum laude with a degree in Artificially-Intelligent Reverse Micro-Financial Quantum Computing. Degree in hand, he moved to Silicon Valley and launched an immensely successful start-up, SockMate, which helps people find matching pairs of socks under their beds no matter how hung over they are. Not only has the company made billions, but Thelonious pushed his roommates out of the business. In just five years, he had become one of the world’s most famous billionaires, sitting atop a fortune of some US$10 billion and dating New Zealand-born pop sensation Lorde. He obtained a U.S. green card and is in default of his residency obligations under IRPA, s 28. The Minister brought an application to cease his refugee protection, arguing that he can no longer be a protected person since he was no longer a Canadian permanent resident and because, if he ever gets into trouble, he can just hide out in New Zealand with Lorde, along with all his money and his unlost socks. **Should the application be accepted under IRPA, s 108?**
        - **No.** Despite his loss of permanent residence and his obtention of a US Green Card, **none of the grounds for cessation apply**. IRPA, s 108(1)(c) provides that a protected person’s refugee protection may be ceased if they obtain nationality in a third country and enjoys the protection of that country. However, Musque only has US permanent residence and not US citizenship. Finally, s 108 does not allow for cessation in cases of extreme wealth or romantic attachment to a celebrity.
    - Cessation Scenario 2: Miss Molly was granted refugee protection in 2004, claiming a fear of the police in her country of origin. In 2009, 2010, and 2016 she travelled back to her country of origin. The Minister applied to have her refugee protection ceased. During the cessation hearing, she testified that she returned home in 2009 because her mother was diagnosed with a terminal illness, and then in 2010 when her mother died. Both times, she said, she went immediately to the family home and never went out other than for the funeral. In 2016, she testified that she returned home after the death of her father. This time, she said, she stayed with a sister and went out for the funeral. On another occasion, she went to a bar for a night out with friends and family that she had not seen for 12 years. She admits it was risky, but fortunately nothing happened. It was part of the grieving process, she said. **Please set out an analysis of whether the Minister’s application should be granted under IRPA, s 108(1)(a)**. 
        - The courts have accepted that “**re-availment**” under IRPA, s 108(1)(a) requires three things: 
            - (1) **voluntariness**: the re-availing act must be voluntary (and not coerced); 
            - (2) **intention**: the refugee must intend to re-avail of the protection of their country of origin; 
            - (3) **re-availment**: the refugee must actually obtain such protection. 
        - In a case such as this one, much will turn on the RPD’s evaluation of the credibility of Miss Molly’s testimony and the weight afforded to it. Here, Miss Molly’s return to her country of origin in 2009, 2010, and 2016 was voluntary. She testifies that she did not intend to re-avail herself of her country’s protection. Finally, whether she actually obtained protection may be assessed using factors listed in the IRB, [Interpretation of the Convention Refugee Definition in the Case Law](https://irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/legal-policy/legal-concepts/Pages/RefDef.aspx){:target="\_blank"} (December 31, 2020) chapter 12, section 12.5.3.3:
            - “use of a passport to travel, the reason for the travel, whether or not the protected person took precautions, and the length of the visit are all factors that the RPD and the Courts have considered to answer the question of whether the protected person has actually reavailed.” 
        - Militating in favour of allowing the application are the fact that Miss Molly returned three times to her country of origin and that, on her third visit, she went out in public to a place where she might easily be seen. Militating against allowing the application is the fact that – apart from the outing to the bar – she essentially remained in hiding. 
        - On balance, when comparing this case to a decision like [***Din v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***](https://canlii.ca/t/hzn0j){:target="\_blank"}, 2019 FC 425 (cited in the IRB’s chapter), it seems like the application should be rejected.
    - Vacation Scenario 1: A’s claim for refugee protection was accepted on the ground that she took part in marches against the government in her country, protesting its treatment of A’s minority ethnic group. The Minister has brought an application to vacate the decision. The application was brought after an investigation into the consultant who represented A at her initial hearing before the RPD. The consultant was found to have manufactured fraudulent evidence in several claims, including A’s. In particular, he had manufactured a police summons and court judgment relating to her alleged arrest at a protest march. A admits that she did not take part in the protest march. **How would the vacation application have to be analyzed?** 
        - As stated in the IRB's [Interpretation of the Convention Refugee Definition in the Case Law](https://irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/legal-policy/legal-concepts/Pages/RefDef.aspx){:target="\_blank"} (December 31, 2020) chapter 13 at section 13.5.2, the analysis of an application to **vacate** a decision granting refugee protection involves **two steps**: 
            - First, the RPD must find that the decision granting refugee protection was obtained as **a result of a direct or indirect misrepresentation, or a withholding of material facts** relating to a relevant matter; and  
            - Second, the RPD should consider **whether there remains sufficient evidence** that was considered at the time of the positive determination to **justify refugee protection** and, if so, the RPD may reject the application to vacate, notwithstanding the misrepresentation. 
        - Here, it appears that refugee protection was granted principally on the basis of A’s participation in anti-government protests. However, there is also some suggestion that the government might engage in the mistreatment of or discrimination against A’s minority ethnic group. Accordingly, under the second step of the analysis, the RPD will have to analyze whether, merely as a member of her ethnic group, A falls under either section 96 or 97 of the IRPA. 
    - Vacation Scenario 2: P is an accepted refugee claimant who crossed into Canada from the United States. Her claim was accepted based on her alleged fear of being targeted for rape and other reprisals in Honduras, her alleged country of citizenship. The RPD also considered evidence that she had been convicted in Florida of three counts of unlawful sexual activity with a minor and sentenced to 30 years’ imprisonment. It decided that she was not excluded under article 1F(b) because her actions would not have constituted a crime in Canada, due to the age of the minor (16) and the fact that P was not in a position of trust relative to him. (Under the Criminal Code, the age of consent is 16 unless the adult is in a position of trust, in which case the age of consent is 18.) On a vacation application, in which it proffers evidence that P is not in fact a citizen of Honduras but of the United States. **Should the application be allowed?** 
        - **Likely not.** The RPD considered evidence relating to P’s conviction under the heading of exclusion. However, that same evidence might establish that P is a person in need of protection under IRPA s 97(1)(b). That is, even though P is a citizen of the United States, it is arguable that the sentence of 30 years’ imprisonment is “cruel and unusual treatment or punishment” applied “in disregard of accepted international standards” (see IRPA, s 97(1)(b)(iii)). If so, she would be a person in need of protection under IRPA, s 97. **The crucial point here is to ask whether the sentence complies with international standards.** If not, then the application should be rejected under IRPA, s 109(2). For a case that considered this issue, see [***X (Re), 2012 CanLII 95148 (CA IRB)***](https://canlii.ca/t/fxk8b){:target="\_blank"} and [***Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Harvey***](https://canlii.ca/t/fzlkm){:target="\_blank"}, 2013 FC 717.
    - In cessation analysis, rthree-part test for re-availment: the refugee must have 
        - 1) acted voluntarily; 
        - 2) intended to re-avail himself of their country’s protection; and 
        - 3) actually obtained such protection. 
    - If refugees acquire and travel on passports issued by their country of nationality to travel to that country or to third country, then there is a presumption that they have intended to avail themselves of protection of their country of nationality. 
    - However, this presumption is rebuttable. In determining whether the presumption of re-availment has been rebutted, the RPD must consider the factors set out in [***Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Galindo Camayo***](https://canlii.ca/t/jndkg){:target="\_blank"}, 2022 FCA 50 (CanLII), at para 84: "Thus, in dealing with cessation cases, the RPD should have regard to the following factors, at a minimum, which may assist in rebutting the presumption of re-availment. No individual factor will necessarily be dispositive, and all of the evidence relating to these factors should be considered and balanced in order to determine whether the actions of the individual are such that they have rebutted the presumption of re-availment."
        - The provisions of subsection 108(1) of IRPA, which operate as a constraint on the RPD in arriving at a reasonable decision: ***Vavilov*** SCC, above, at paragraphs 115–124;
        - The provisions of international conventions such as the Refugee Convention and guidelines such as the Refugee Handbook, as international law operates as an important constraint on administrative decision makers such as the RPD. Legislation is presumed to operate in conformity with Canada’s international obligations, and the legislature is “presumed to comply with the values and principles of customary and conventional international law”: ***Vavilov*** SCC, above, at paragraph 114, citing ***R. v. Hape***, 2007 SCC 26, [2007] 2 S.C.R. 292, at paragraph 53; ***R. v. Appulonappa***, 2015 SCC 59, [2015] 3 S.C.R. 754, at paragraph 40; see also IRPA, paragraph 3(3)(f).
        - The severity of the **consequences** that a decision to cease refugee protection will have for the affected individual. Where the impact of a decision on an individual’s rights and interests is severe, the reasons provided to that individual must reflect the stakes: ***Vavilov*** SCC, above, at paragraphs 133–135;
        - The submissions of the parties. The principles of justification and transparency require that an administrative decision maker’s reasons **meaningfully engage with the central issues and the concerns** raised by the parties: ***Vavilov*** SCC, above, at paragraphs 127–128;
        - The state of the **individual’s knowledge** with respect to the cessation provisions. Evidence that a person has returned to her country of origin in the full knowledge that it may put her refugee status in jeopardy may potentially have different significance than evidence that a person is unaware of the potential consequences of her actions;
        - The **personal attributes** of the individual such as her age, education and level of sophistication;
        - The **identity** of the agent of persecution. That is, does the individual fear the government of her country of nationality or does she claim to fear a non-state actor? Evidence that a person who claims to fear the government of her country of nationality nevertheless discloses her whereabouts to that same government by applying for a passport or entering the country may be interpreted differently than evidence with respect to individuals seeking passports who fear non-state actors. In this latter situation, applying for a passport or entering the country will not necessarily expose the individual to their agent of persecution. This may be especially so when all the individual has done is apply for a passport: applying for a passport may have little bearing on the risk faced by a victim of domestic violence, for example, or her level of subjective fear;
        - Whether the obtaining of a passport from the country of origin is done **voluntarily**;
        - Whether the individual **actually used** the passport for travel purposes. If so, was there travel to the individual’s country of nationality or to third countries? Travel to the individual’s country of nationality may, in some cases, be found to have a different significance than travel to a third country;
        - What was the **purpose** of the travel? The RPD may consider travel to the country of nationality for a compelling reason such as the serious illness of a family member to have a different significance than travel to that same country for a more frivolous reason such as a vacation or a visit with friends;
        - The **frequency** and **duration** of the travel;
        - What the individual **did** while in the country in question;
        - Whether the individual took any **precautionary** measures while she was in her country of nationality. Evidence that an individual took steps to conceal her return, such as remaining sequestered in a home or hotel throughout the visit or engaging private security while in the country of origin, may be viewed differently than evidence that the individual moved about freely and openly while in her country of nationality;
        - Whether the actions of the individual demonstrate that she no longer has a subjective fear of persecution in the country of nationality such that surrogate protection may no longer be required; and
        - Any other factors relevant to the question of whether the particular individual has rebutted the presumption of re-availment in a given case.

    20. Which of the following persons could be selected as a member of the Country of asylum class?

Hawkeye is ineligible because the Minister has commenced a citizenship revocation proceeding against him: see IRPR, s 156(1)(e). Black Widow is not ineligible because – although she was convicted of an offence that is found in Schedule I of the Corrections and Conditional Release Act – **she completed her sentence more than 5 years ago**: see IRPR, s 156(1)(b). Anger management, though perhaps regrettable, is not a ground for ineligibility.

       	- [x] True
