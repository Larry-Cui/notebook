??? note "Module Introduction"

    - two subjects: The framework for refugee **resettlement** and the rights of persons recognized as **protected persons** under the IRPA.
    - A person granted protected person status may lose that status, when it is either “**cessated**” or “**vacated**” by the **Refugee Protection Division**. Cessation, as we will see, governs cases where the government alleges a protected person’s behaviour indicates they **no longer need protection**. Vacation applies where the government seeks to prove that refugee protection status was granted due to **misrepresentation or the withholding of material facts**.

??? note "Resettlement"

    - the statutory framework for resettlement is set out in the IRPA and the Regulations, and their application is explained in the operational instructions.
    - **What are eligibility and substantive criteria for being accepted as a refugee for resettlement?** 
        - Here you should focus on IRPR, ss 139 and 144-147.
        - 139(1): outside Canada, submitted an application, intention to come to Canada permanently, cannot resettle in habitual residence or repatriate to country of nationality, having sponsor, financial assistance from Canada or funds available by themselves, successfully established ability
        - 145: A foreign national is a Convention refugee abroad and a member of **the Convention refugees abroad class** if the foreign national has been determined, outside Canada, **by an officer** to be a Convention refugee.
        - 147: A foreign national is a member of **the country of asylum class** if they have been determined **by an officer** to be in need of resettlement because
            - (a) they are outside all of their countries of nationality and habitual residence; and
            - (b) they have been, and continue to be, seriously and personally affected by civil war, armed conflict or massive violation of human rights in each of those countries.
    - **What are the requirements for sponsorship of resettlement applicants?** 
        - Here you should focus on IRPR, ss 140.2, 152-158, as well as IRPA 13-13.2.
        - A13(1): A Canadian citizen or permanent resident, or a group of Canadian citizens or permanent residents, a corporation incorporated under a law of Canada or of a province or an unincorporated organization or association under federal or provincial law — or any combination of them — may **sponsor a foreign national**, subject to the regulations.
        - 153(1): a sponsor must: reside in the community, make a sponsorship application, not default in the past. 
        - 153(1.2): the sponsor must send the **sponsorship application** and the **application for a permanent resident visa** to the Department’s **Case Processing Centre in Canada for processing** those applications.
        - 156(1) **Ineligibility to sponsor**: convicted, default any support payment, removal order, citizenship revocated, detained. 
    - [***Ha v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)***](https://canlii.ca/t/1gcfx){:target="\_blank"}, (2004) 3 FC 195, 2004 FCA 49, Paragraphs 9-19, 46, 66-68
        - is a key case on procedural fairness in resettlement applications. In its decision, the Federal Court of Appeal applied the **five *Baker* factors** to determine that procedural fairness mandates that **counsel should be allowed to attend resettlement interviews**. In the analysis of those factors, we recommend you focus on the nature of the decision being made by the visa officer and the rights of counsel during the interview. Is the decision a predominantly legal one, or is it characterized by considerable discretion? What purposes may be served by having counsel attend the resettlement interview?
    - [***Helal v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***](https://canlii.ca/t/hx1bx){:target="\_blank"}, 2019 FC 37, Paragraphs 15-23
        - is a more recent case concerning procedural fairness in a resettlement application. The Federal Court found that – notwithstanding ***Ha*** – the procedural fairness owed to foreign nationals seeking entry to Canada is “**at the lower end of the spectrum**” (para 18). It goes on to consider whether there was a breach of procedural fairness in that case. Here we recommend asking yourself: What was the alleged breach of procedural fairness? What principle did the Court use to resolve the issue?
    - [***Anku v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***](https://canlii.ca/t/jd2qg){:target="\_blank"}, 2021 FC 125
        - discusses several, cross-cutting errors in an officer’s decision on a resettlement. This aspect of the decision is helpful for its break down of the nature of the decision that must be made by an officer. Later, the court zeroes in on the issue of whether or not the applicants’ had a “durable solution” and so failed to meet the requirements of IRPR, s 139(1)(d) (which requires that a foreign national must be “a person in respect of which there is no reasonable prospect, within a reasonable period, of a durable solution in a country other than Canada”). The court affirmed that **an evaluation of whether there is a durable solution is “a highly contextual exercise, driven by the facts”** (para 30). Here we recommend you consider comparing the court’s discussion of this issue with the discussion of durable solutions in the IRCC operations manual.
    - **Scenario 1:** It is 2011. The principal applicant is a widow and citizen of Afghanistan. Her application includes her three adult sons, their wives and children (the principal applicant’s grandchildren). The family left Afghanistan in 1993 after the Mujahadeen took over the country and the principal applicant’s son was injured in an attack. They fled the country and have lived in a refugee camp in Pakistan since then. The applicants are from Kabul, which in 2011 was under government control and enjoyed relative stability. They do not have any family members in Afghanistan. Are the applicants members of either the Convention refugees abroad class or the Country of asylum class?
        - **Likely not.** To be a member of the Convention refugees abroad class, an applicant must “have been determined, outside Canada, by an officer to be a Convention refugee” (IRPR, s 145). However, the facts as described to do not disclose a fear of persecution for a Convention reason (recall the requirements from Module 3). To be a member of the Country of asylum class, an applicant must have been determined by an officer to be **in need of resettlement because** (a) they are **outside** all of their countries of nationality and habitual residence; and (b) they have been, and continue to be, seriously and personally **affected by civil war, armed conflict or massive violation of human rights** in each of those countries (IRPR, s 147). However, the relative stability of Kabul indicates that they do not continue to be seriously and personally affected by the civil war, armed conflict or human rights violations that plagued Afghanistan for so long.
    - **Scenario 2:** The principal applicant has lived in South Africa with refugee status for 14 years with his wife and their four children. All of them are citizens of Ethiopia. The principal applicant has been the victim of several burglaries, losing items such as a television set and 15,000 Rand stolen from a box under his sofa, as well as other items and amounts. The principal applicant has a business. His children are all entitled to attend public school. The principal applicant says that he and his family are the victims of discrimination, including at school. He says they are targeted by burglars also because they are foreigners. The principal applicant’s first cousin and some other individuals sponsored his application. Does the principal applicant and his family have a durable solution in South Africa? 
        - **Likely yes.** Note that there is no precise definition of “**durable solution**.” Whether someone has a durable solution is a “**highly contextual exercise, driven by the facts” (Anku, para 30)**. IRPR, s 139(d) refers to two types of durable solution – **voluntary repatriation and resettlement.** IRCC’s operational instructions also refer to a third – **local integration** (presumably subsumed under “resettlement”). Here, local integration in South Africa is candidate durable solution. The instructions indicate that “[l]ocal integration allows the refugee to live permanently in safety and dignity in the country of refuge and partake of its enduring legal, economic and social benefits.” Determining whether local integration has or can occurred “requires careful analysis … of both country conditions, the applicant’s individual circumstances and a comparison of these circumstances” to the instructions. **Among the indicators of local integration are “long-term residency” and “access to participate in society.”** In this case, it is not clear whether the principal applicant and his family have access to long-term residency. The severity of the discrimination is not clear either. However, the principal applicant has a business, and his children have access to schooling. Unless their status is precarious (leading to a fear of refoulement) and the discrimination is serious, they likely at least have access to at least de facto local integration.
    - **Scenario 3:** The applicant is a citizen of Eritrea who was accepted as a refugee in Italy in 2015. In Italy, the applicant alleges she experiences discrimination, racism, and exploitation as a single female refugee. She works long hours (50+ hours a week) as a factory worker, facing harassment, verbal and physical abuse, and inappropriate touching. The applicant has three children who currently live in Ethiopia with an aunt. She says it would be easier to reunite with them and care for them in Canada because there she would have her sponsors’ help. Her sponsors are a group of her relatives. Is the applicant entitled to a permanent resident visa because she is in need of refugee protection? 
        - **Likely not.** The applicant’s circumstances in Italy, while difficult, do not indicate that she does not have a durable solution there. However, Desloges & Sawicki notes (at 513) that: “**In the event of an ineligibility problem, section 25 of the IRPA affords officers the broad discretion to ‘grant the foreign national permanent resident status…’**” Note that section 25 requires that the “best interests of a child directly affected” be taken into account. In this case, the applicant could request that the officer take into account the best interests of her children, including their chances of reuniting with their mother and the increased support they would get from the applicant’s relatives in Canada.

???+ note "Cessation and Vacation"

    - These are two ways that a person who has been granted refugee protection may lose their status as protected persons **on application by the Minister**.
        - **Cessation** applies when a person no longer needs protection. 
        - **Vacation** applies when a person obtained protection through fraudulent means.
    - Cessation can occur either because circumstances in a person’s country of origin have **changed** or because the person has taken certain actions that indicate they are **not at risk**. Specifically, section 108 of the IRPA, applies when a person:
        - Has voluntarily “**re-availed**” themselves of the protection of their country of nationality;
        - Has voluntarily **reacquired** their nationality;
        - Has acquired a new nationality and enjoys the protection of the country of that nationality;
        - Has voluntarily become **re-established** in the country that the person left or remained outside of and in respect of which the person claimed refugee protection in Canada; or
        - The **reasons** for which the person sought refugee protection have **ceased to exist**.
    - the last ground for cessation does not apply under subsection 108(4) “if there are **compelling reasons** arising out of previous persecution, torture, treatment or punishment for refusing to avail themselves of the protection of the country which they left”.
    - If the Minister’s application is accepted, the person’s claim is deemed to have been rejected. If the person was a permanent resident, they will lose permanent resident status under paragraph **46(1)(c.1)** of the IRPA (unless the application is allowed under paragraph 108(1)(e) for a change in circumstances) and will be deemed inadmissible under section 40.1.
    - [***Nsende v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)***](https://canlii.ca/t/1wrls){:target="\_blank"}, 2008 FC 531
        - ***Nsende*** addresses the interpretation of paragraph 108(1)(a) of the IRPA, cessation because of **voluntary re-availment**. As the IRB’s guide indicates, **paragraph 108(1)(a) is the most frequently invoked ground of cessation**. In reading the case, you should ask yourself: What are the requirements for establishing re-availment? What role does intention play?

        - [x] To decide whether a report, such as an inadmissibility assessment,ought to be disclosed to a foreign national applying for resettlement, one must be considered whether **sufficient information has been disclosed** to allow the applicant an opportunity to meaningfully participate in the decision-making process. 
        - [ ] Disclosure of a report – such as an inadmissibility assessment – is in general unnecessary, but counsel for the foreign national who is the subject of the report must be given the opportunity to question the report's author. 
    > See paragraph 19 of Helal. Note that paragraph 17 of the decision rejects the proposition found in A.

        - [ ] In the circumstances of a particular case, the duty of fairness may require counsel be allowed to attend a resettlement interview as an observer, including by rescheduling to accommodate counsel's schedule.
        - [x] In the circumstances of a particular case, the duty of fairness may require that **counsel be allowed to attend a resettlement interview as an observer**. However, interviews, **need not be rescheduled to accommodate counsel**.
        - [ ] Due to the seriousness of the decision for the applicant and the legal nature of the assessment, the duty of fairness implies a right to counsel during a resettlement interview as an observer.
        - [ ] Due to the seriousness of the decision for the applicant and the legal nature of the assessment, the duty of fairness implies a right to counsel during a resettlement interview to observe, to object to questions, and to ask redirect questions if appropriate. 
    > See paragraphs 66-67 of the decision. 

    20. Which of the following persons could be selected as a member of the Country of asylum class?

        - [ ] Ron, who is living in hiding in his country of nationality, which is beset by a terrible civil war. 
        - [x] Hermione, who has recently fled her home country after a genocidal campaign by the central government led to the death of her parents.
        - [ ] Neville, who has fled his country because he belongs to an ethnic group that is subject to persistent and serious discrimination. 
    > To be a member of the Country of asylum class, a foreign national must be "**outside all of their countries of nationality and habitual residence**" and "**seriously and personally affected** by civil war, armed conflict or massive violation of human rights in each of those countries." 
    > Hermione fled her home country and has been seriously and personally affected by a massive violation of human rights in that country. None of the others qualify: Harry is inside a country of habitual residence; Ron is still inside his country of nationality; and Neville has not been seriously and personally affected by a civil war, armed conflict, or a massive violation of human rights.  

    21. The Convention refugee abroad class is repealed and no longer available.
        - [ ] True
        - [x] False

    22. Which of the following are among the **requirements** for obtaining a permanent resident visa as either a Convention refugee abroad or a Humanitarian-protected person abroad? Click on all that apply.
        - [x] The foreign national is seeking to come to Canada to establish permanent residence. 
        - [ ] The foreign national has ranked Canada first among all potential resettlement destinations.
        - [ ] If the foreign national intends to reside in a province other than Quebec, they will be able to become successfully economically established in Canada.
        - [x] The foreign national must be outside Canada. 
        - [x] The foreign national and their family members are not inadmissible. 
    > See IRPR, s 139(1) for the criteria. B is not correct; in fact, the foreign national must have no reasonable prospect, within a reasonable period, of a "durable solution" in another country. C is not correct because the requirement (for applicants who are not vulnerable or in an urgent situation: IRPR, s 139(2)) is that a foreign national and their family be able to become successfully established in Canada, **not successfully economically established**: IRPS, s 139(1)(g). 

    23. For a **family member** who is not accompanying the applicant to be issued a permanent resident visa, the family member must have been either (a) included in the applicant's permanent resident visa **application** at the time the application was made or (b) added to the application before the applicant's **departure** for Canada.
