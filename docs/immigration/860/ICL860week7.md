??? note "Francisco Ramírez López: An IRB Mock Hearing"

    - Part 1: Opening of Hearing and Preliminary Submissions: What do you think about the way the RPD member dealt with the applications by counsel in light of the rules? Do you think the RPD applied the rules fairly? 
    - Part 2: IRB Member Introduces Hearing and Asks First Set of Questions: Were there any questions by the RPD that you felt were poor in some way? For instance, maybe you find them unfair in some way or irrelevant. Which ones? Why? 
    - Part 3: IRB Member Concludes her Questioning: What do you think of the claimant’s answers? Do they raise concerns about his credibility or any other concerns? Can you think of ways he might have been better prepared for the hearing? 
    - Part 4: Questioning by Counsel: Do you think the questions from claimant’s counsel helped or hurt his client? What strategic considerations do you think led to his specific questions?

    - Part 5: Counsels' Submissions: On what basis is the Minister asking the RPD to reject the claim? Do you find their argument convincing? What could have made it more convincing?  What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Claimant’s Counsel’s submissions? What could have made it more convincing?

???+ note "From Theory to Practice: Fairness and Natural Justice"

    - fairness and natural justice can roughly be broken down into two overarching principles: 
        - **The right to be heard**, which can lead to rights such as the right to notice, the right to be present at a hearing, the right to present evidence and make submissions, and the right to be represented, among others. 
        - **The right to an impartial decision-maker**, which translates into the right to have a decision-maker who is open-minded and is free of undue or untoward influence during the decision-making process. The test for reasonable apprehension of bias is *What would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically – and having thought the matter through – conclude. Would he think that it is more likely than not that [the decision-maker], whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly.* ***Committee for Justice and Liberty v. National Energy Board***, [1976 CanLII 2 (SCC)](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1976/1976canlii2/1976canlii2.html){:target="\_blank"} at 394.  
    - Scenario 1: During a hearing, an RPD member repeatedly interrupts questions posed to the claimant by his counsel. For example, at one point counsel asked the claimant, “What was your state of mind like at that period?” The member interrupted and stated, “I think we are losing, wasting time on state of mind. Let’s go back, okay, please. We can cover that afterwards.” At the end of the hearing the member asked counsel how long his submissions were going to be. Counsel replied about twenty minutes. The member responded that she needed to be out of there by 12 and could the submissions be given in writing. Counsel reluctantly agreed. **Has there been a breach of natural justice or procedural fairness?  Yes, no, or it depends?**
        - It depends. 
        - First, it depends on whether counsel was indeed allowed to go back and ask about the claimant’s state of mind. 
        - Second, if not, it depends on how important that evidence was to the claim. For example, if the RPD rejects the claim based on delay in leaving the country of origin, and the questions about the claimant’s state of mind would have nourished an explanation of the delay, then there may have been a breach of procedural fairness. 
        - Finally, it depends on whether requiring submissions in writing rather than orally was procedurally unfair for some reason. Here, there may be an argument that could be made based on the RPD’s failure to follow the rules. RPD Rule 10(7) (which we read in Module 2) states that “[r]epresentations must be made orally at the end of a hearing unless the Division orders otherwise.” Here, the RPD ordered otherwise, but does not give reasons for the order. On the other hand, RPD Rule 71 states that “[u]nless proceedings are declared invalid by the Division, a failure to follow any requirement of these Rules does not make the proceedings invalid.” In other words, even if the RPD violated its own rules by not giving a good enough reason for declining to receive oral submissions, you would have to prove an independent breach of procedural fairness. **It is not clear how being required to make submissions in writing leads to unfairness by violating the claimant’s right to be heard.**
    - Scenario 2: The member found that the claimant had never been attacked by skinheads based on a discrepancy between his testimony and his written narrative about the number of attacks. The member had said to the claimant during the hearing that he thought that this was only a slight discrepancy and that it would be unfair of him to make a finding based upon it. **Has there been a breach of procedural fairness or a failure of natural justice? Yes, no or it depends?**
        - Yes. A “**legitimate expectation**” refers to a procedural expectation that is created by a representation from someone in authority that is “clear, unambiguous, and unqualified” ***(Canada (Attorney General) v Mavi***, 2011 SCC 30 at para 68). Such an expectation may be with respect to a procedure that will be followed. Alternately, an expectation may be with respect to a certain result. In the latter case, while there is no right to that result, there is an expectation of greater procedural fairness if the opposite result is reached. 
        - Here, the RPD member made a clear, unambiguous, and unqualified representation as to how they would treat a certain issue with respect to credibility. It was unfair to then make a finding on that issue without giving the claimant the right to offer further evidence, likely in the form of an explanation, or submissions. (For a discussion of legitimate expectations, see Nastasi et al. at 56-57.) 
        - In addition, a principle in the credibility case law is that **important credibility concerns must be put to a claimant**. This principle is expressed as follows in ***Jurado Barillas v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***, 2019 FC 825 at para 14:
            - I find that the **RPD erred by not alerting the Principal Applicant to credibility concerns and allowing the Principal Applicant an opportunity to address these concerns**. While the RPD is not required to put every deficiency to an applicant, when a deficiency is central to the RPD’s determination, the RPD’s failure to put the matter to an applicant may be a violation of procedural fairness … 
        - Therefore, independently of the member’s statement, there seems to have been a requirement of notice that the member considered the issue to be important. 
    - Scenario 3: The claim was heard by a member who became ill after the hearing but prior to rendering a decision. The claimants were given the choice to have the matter heard anew by a new member or to have the new member make a decision based on the transcript of the hearing. Counsel for the claimants chose to have the new member make a decision based on the transcript of the hearing. The claimants also requested that they be provided with a transcript and allowed an opportunity to provide submissions prior to a decision being made. The RPD did not make a decision on this request. The transcript was not provided prior to the final decision being rendered. **Has there been a breach of procedural fairness or a failure of natural justice?  Yes, no, or it depends?**
        - It depends, but probably not. First, it depends on whether the claimant had made submissions orally at the end of the hearing. If not, **the claimant was deprived of the right to make submissions and there has likely been a breach of procedural fairness.** It also depends on whether or not the “request” was made in the form of an application under RPD rule 49 and 50. If the request was not made in accordance with the rules, a failure to provide a decision would be less likely to be considered a breach of procedural fairness. Even if there were a formal application, however, it is unlikely that a breach of procedural fairness has occurred (so long as oral submissions were made). The claimant has had the right to present evidence and make submissions. **The change in the decision-maker does not introduce any new burden or circumstance to which the claimant would be entitled to respond**.
    - Scenario 4: The Member informs the Minister's counsel and the claimant's counsel that when they present their representations, they should take into account that the Member is very familiar with the country conditions and unless there is a very recent development, the Member is interested in hearing only claim-specific observations, which, in the Member's estimation, should not take more than 20 minutes. **Has there been a breach of procedural fairness or a failure of natural justice?  Yes, no, or it depends?**
        - No. RPD subrule 10(7) covers submissions; it states that counsel should be ready to give oral submissions at the end of a hearing. Paragraphs 5.8 and 5.9 of Chairperson’s Guideline 7 cover the **power of the RPD to place limits on representations**:
            - 5.8 Parties will have an opportunity to make representations at the hearing. The member will set time limits for the representations after all the evidence has been heard. The time limits will be reasonable in relation to the duration of the hearing, the number of issues and the amount of relevant evidence heard. 
            - 5.9 In general, it is expected that counsel should be ready to give oral representations after the evidence has been heard. These representations must be relevant, focused and concise so that they help the member to decide the claim efficiently and make it possible for the member to give an oral decision and reasons at the end of the hearing. 
        - Here, the RPD has given counsel guidance on how best to focus their submissions to help them decide the claim efficiently. If counsel strays from that guidance, they do so at their client’s peril.
