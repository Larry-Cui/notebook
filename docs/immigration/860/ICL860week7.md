??? note "Francisco Ramírez López: An IRB Mock Hearing"

    - Part 1: Opening of Hearing and Preliminary Submissions: What do you think about the way the RPD member dealt with the applications by counsel in light of the rules? Do you think the RPD applied the rules fairly? 
    - Part 2: IRB Member Introduces Hearing and Asks First Set of Questions: Were there any questions by the RPD that you felt were poor in some way? For instance, maybe you find them unfair in some way or irrelevant. Which ones? Why? 
    - Part 3: IRB Member Concludes her Questioning: What do you think of the claimant’s answers? Do they raise concerns about his credibility or any other concerns? Can you think of ways he might have been better prepared for the hearing? 
    - Part 4: Questioning by Counsel: Do you think the questions from claimant’s counsel helped or hurt his client? What strategic considerations do you think led to his specific questions? Is counsel pursuing a sound strategy? Are there any questions that you think he should not have asked? Any questions he should have asked but did not?  
    - Part 5: Counsels' Submissions: On what basis is the Minister asking the RPD to reject the claim? Do you find their argument convincing? What could have made it more convincing?  What are the strengths and weaknesses of the Claimant’s Counsel’s submissions? What could have made it more convincing?

??? note "From Theory to Practice: Fairness and Natural Justice"

    - fairness and natural justice can roughly be broken down into two overarching principles: 
        - **The right to be heard**, which can lead to rights such as the right to notice, the right to be present at a hearing, the right to present evidence and make submissions, and the right to be represented, among others. 
        - **The right to an impartial decision-maker**, which translates into the right to have a decision-maker who is open-minded and is free of undue or untoward influence during the decision-making process. The test for reasonable apprehension of bias is *What would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically – and having thought the matter through – conclude. Would he think that it is more likely than not that [the decision-maker], whether consciously or unconsciously, would not decide fairly.* ***Committee for Justice and Liberty v. National Energy Board***, [1976 CanLII 2 (SCC)](https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1976/1976canlii2/1976canlii2.html){:target="\_blank"} at 394.  
    - Scenario 1: During a hearing, an RPD member repeatedly interrupts questions posed to the claimant by his counsel. For example, at one point counsel asked the claimant, “What was your state of mind like at that period?” The member interrupted and stated, “I think we are losing, wasting time on state of mind. Let’s go back, okay, please. We can cover that afterwards.” At the end of the hearing the member asked counsel how long his submissions were going to be. Counsel replied about twenty minutes. The member responded that she needed to be out of there by 12 and could the submissions be given in writing. Counsel reluctantly agreed. **Has there been a breach of natural justice or procedural fairness?  Yes, no, or it depends?**
        - It depends. 
        - First, it depends on whether counsel was indeed allowed to go back and ask about the claimant’s state of mind. 
        - Second, if not, it depends on how important that evidence was to the claim. For example, if the RPD rejects the claim based on delay in leaving the country of origin, and the questions about the claimant’s state of mind would have nourished an explanation of the delay, then there may have been a breach of procedural fairness. 
        - Finally, it depends on whether requiring submissions in writing rather than orally was procedurally unfair for some reason. Here, there may be an argument that could be made based on the RPD’s failure to follow the rules. RPD Rule 10(7) (which we read in Module 2) states that “[r]epresentations must be made orally at the end of a hearing unless the Division orders otherwise.” Here, the RPD ordered otherwise, but does not give reasons for the order. On the other hand, RPD Rule 71 states that “[u]nless proceedings are declared invalid by the Division, a failure to follow any requirement of these Rules does not make the proceedings invalid.” In other words, even if the RPD violated its own rules by not giving a good enough reason for declining to receive oral submissions, you would have to prove an independent breach of procedural fairness. **It is not clear how being required to make submissions in writing leads to unfairness by violating the claimant’s right to be heard.**
    - Scenario 2: The member found that the claimant had never been attacked by skinheads based on a discrepancy between his testimony and his written narrative about the number of attacks. The member had said to the claimant during the hearing that he thought that this was only a slight discrepancy and that it would be unfair of him to make a finding based upon it. **Has there been a breach of procedural fairness or a failure of natural justice? Yes, no or it depends?**
        - Yes. A “**legitimate expectation**” refers to a procedural expectation that is created by a representation from someone in authority that is “clear, unambiguous, and unqualified” ***(Canada (Attorney General) v Mavi***, 2011 SCC 30 at para 68). Such an expectation may be with respect to a procedure that will be followed. Alternately, an expectation may be with respect to a certain result. In the latter case, while there is no right to that result, there is an expectation of greater procedural fairness if the opposite result is reached. 
        - Here, the RPD member made a clear, unambiguous, and unqualified representation as to how they would treat a certain issue with respect to credibility. It was unfair to then make a finding on that issue without giving the claimant the right to offer further evidence, likely in the form of an explanation, or submissions. (For a discussion of legitimate expectations, see Nastasi et al. at 56-57.) 
        - In addition, a principle in the credibility case law is that **important credibility concerns must be put to a claimant**. This principle is expressed as follows in ***Jurado Barillas v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***, 2019 FC 825 at para 14:
            - I find that the **RPD erred by not alerting the Principal Applicant to credibility concerns and allowing the Principal Applicant an opportunity to address these concerns**. While the RPD is not required to put every deficiency to an applicant, when a deficiency is central to the RPD’s determination, the RPD’s failure to put the matter to an applicant may be a violation of procedural fairness … 
        - Therefore, independently of the member’s statement, there seems to have been a requirement of notice that the member considered the issue to be important. 
    - Scenario 3: The claim was heard by a member who became ill after the hearing but prior to rendering a decision. The claimants were given the choice to have the matter heard anew by a new member or to have the new member make a decision based on the transcript of the hearing. Counsel for the claimants chose to have the new member make a decision based on the transcript of the hearing. The claimants also requested that they be provided with a transcript and allowed an opportunity to provide submissions prior to a decision being made. The RPD did not make a decision on this request. The transcript was not provided prior to the final decision being rendered. **Has there been a breach of procedural fairness or a failure of natural justice?  Yes, no, or it depends?**
        - It depends, but probably not. First, it depends on whether the claimant had made submissions orally at the end of the hearing. If not, **the claimant was deprived of the right to make submissions and there has likely been a breach of procedural fairness.** It also depends on whether or not the “request” was made in the form of an application under RPD rule 49 and 50. If the request was not made in accordance with the rules, a failure to provide a decision would be less likely to be considered a breach of procedural fairness. Even if there were a formal application, however, it is unlikely that a breach of procedural fairness has occurred (so long as oral submissions were made). The claimant has had the right to present evidence and make submissions. **The change in the decision-maker does not introduce any new burden or circumstance to which the claimant would be entitled to respond**.
    - Scenario 4: The Member informs the Minister's counsel and the claimant's counsel that when they present their representations, they should take into account that the Member is very familiar with the country conditions and unless there is a very recent development, the Member is interested in hearing only claim-specific observations, which, in the Member's estimation, should not take more than 20 minutes. **Has there been a breach of procedural fairness or a failure of natural justice?  Yes, no, or it depends?**
        - No. RPD subrule 10(7) covers submissions; it states that counsel should be ready to give oral submissions at the end of a hearing. Paragraphs 5.8 and 5.9 of Chairperson’s Guideline 7 cover the **power of the RPD to place limits on representations**:
            - 5.8 Parties will have an opportunity to make representations at the hearing. The member will set time limits for the representations after all the evidence has been heard. The time limits will be reasonable in relation to the duration of the hearing, the number of issues and the amount of relevant evidence heard. 
            - 5.9 In general, it is expected that counsel should be ready to give oral representations after the evidence has been heard. These representations must be relevant, focused and concise so that they help the member to decide the claim efficiently and make it possible for the member to give an oral decision and reasons at the end of the hearing. 
        - Here, the RPD has given counsel guidance on how best to focus their submissions to help them decide the claim efficiently. If counsel strays from that guidance, they do so at their client’s peril.

??? note "The Refugee Appeal Division"

    - A110(2) **No appeal** may be made in respect of any of the following:
        - (a) a decision of the Refugee Protection Division allowing or rejecting the claim for refugee protection of **a designated foreign national**;
        - (b) a determination that a refugee protection claim has been **withdrawn or abandoned**;
        - (c) a decision of the Refugee Protection Division rejecting a claim for refugee protection that states that the claim has **no credible basis** or is **manifestly unfounded**;
        - (d) subject to the regulations, a decision of the Refugee Protection Division in respect of a claim for refugee protection if
            - (i) the foreign national who makes the claim came directly or indirectly to Canada from a country that is, on the day on which their claim is made, designated by regulations made under subsection 102(1) and that is a party to an agreement referred to in paragraph 102(2)(d), and
            - (ii) the claim — by virtue of regulations made under paragraph 102(1)(c) — is not ineligible under paragraph 101(1)(e) to be referred to the Refugee Protection Division;
        - (d.1) a decision of the Refugee Protection Division allowing or rejecting a claim for refugee protection made by a foreign national who is a national of a country that was, on the day on which the decision was made, a **country designated** under subsection 109.1(1);
        - (e) a decision of the Refugee Protection Division allowing or rejecting an application by the Minister for a determination that refugee protection has ceased; 
        - (f) a decision of the Refugee Protection Division allowing or rejecting an application by the Minister to vacate a decision to allow a claim for refugee protection.
    - A110(4): On appeal, the person who is the subject of the appeal may present **only evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim or that was not reasonably available**, or that the person **could not reasonably have been expected** in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection.
    - 111 (1) After considering the appeal, the Refugee Appeal Division shall make one of the following decisions:
        - (a) **confirm** the determination of the Refugee Protection Division;
        - (b) set aside the determination and **substitute** a determination that, in its opinion, should have been made; or
        - (c) **refer** the matter to the Refugee Protection Division for re-determination, giving the directions to the Refugee Protection Division that it considers appropriate.
    - [***Cepeda-Gutierrez v. Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)***](https://canlii.ca/t/49bh){:target="\_blank"}, 1998 CanLII 8667 (FC) 
        - This is the most cited case in refugee law. It establishes the important principle that, while the RPD will normally be presumed to have examined all the evidence in the file, **if it fails to discuss an important piece of evidence, it will be open to a finding that it made an erroneous finding “without regard to the evidence.**” This principle may be the basis for successful appeals.
    - [***Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Huruglica***](https://canlii.ca/t/gp2gp){:target="\_blank"}, 2016 FCA 93
        - The Federal Court of Appeal in this case establishes the way the RAD should review RPD decisions. It establishes that the **RAD ought to apply a “correctness” standard of review to RPD decisions** – i.e., that **it should not show deference to the RPD on appeal** – except in cases where the RPD has a “meaningful advantage” in making a finding with respect to the credibility or weight to be given to oral evidence.
    - [***Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Singh***](https://canlii.ca/t/gp31b){:target="\_blank"}, 2016 FCA 96
        - The Federal Court of Appeal in this case establishes how subsection 110(4) of the IRPA ought to be applied. It establishes that, in addition to the explicit criteria found in 110(4), **the RAD ought to assess the credibility, relevance, and materiality of any proposed new evidence.**
    - [***Bouchra v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)***](https://canlii.ca/t/jcbj3){:target="\_blank"}, 2020 FC 1063
        - This case discusses the **obligation of the RAD to give notice to a claimant** of when it plans to decide an appeal on **an issue that was not treated by the RPD or raised in the claimant’s memorandum of argument.** Its focus is specifically on when the RAD must give notice that it plans to make a decision on a new credibility issue.

??? note "From Theory to Practice: Appeals to the Refugee Appeal Division"

    - Scenario 1: Your client claims refugee protection on the basis of having been pursued by Turkish authorities because she and her family are all members of the Hizmet movement, which was blamed for a coup attempt in July 2016. The RPD rejected her claim in **a decision dated January 4, 2018**. The RPD found the documentary evidence in the National Documentation Package did not support the claim that all persons associated with Hizmet are at risk. On appeal, the claimant submitted two pieces of evidence that were not before the RPD: (1) a letter from her father dated January 14, 2018 outlining the different ways Turkish authorities have gone after members of the family since the July 2016 coup; (2) a transcribed version of a positive decision (delivered orally on December 28, 2017) in an asylum claim made by her brother in the United Kingdom, in which the UK tribunal accepted that all members of the family were at risk. **Is this new evidence admissible on appeal to the RAD? Be sure to consider the application of the relevant provisions of the Act, as well as the Singh decision.**
        - Subsection 110(4) of the IRPA states that on appeal, a claimant may present only evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim or that was not reasonably available, or that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection. **The key date for determining the applicability of s 110(4) is the date of the RPD decision.** In addition to being “new” in the sense of complying with the express requirements of subsection 110(4), ***Singh*** confirms that the evidence must be credible, relevant and material.  
        - The letter from the claimant’s father is “new” in the sense that it is dated after the RPD decision. However, it outlines information that would have been available to the claimant before the RPD’s decision. There is no information given that indicates why the claimant would have been unable to obtain such a letter prior to the RPD’s decision. Therefore, **the letter is not “new” in the sense required by IRPA, s 110(4), and therefore not admissible.** 
        - The decision by the UK tribunal is dated prior to the RPD decision. However, the facts suggest that the decision was only rendered orally on December 28, 2017. It is unlikely – more facts are needed, but importantly a holiday intervened between the UK and RPD decisions – that a written version would have been released prior to January 4, 2018, the date of the RPD decision. In addition, the evidence is “credible” because of its source, relevant because it tends toward proving the fact that the claimant is at risk, and it is material in the sense that “it may have an impact on the RAD’s overall assessment of the RPD’s decision” (see Singh at para 47). Therefore, it seems likely that the UK tribunal decision is admissible, subject to the proviso about the need for more facts about how long it took to get the written version of the decision. 
    - Scenario 2: The RPD has rejected your client’s claim on the basis that they have failed to rebut the presumption of adequate state protection. The RPD’s decision was delivered orally. Its entire treatment of the state protection issue consists of two paragraphs outlining evidence of efforts made by the claimant’s home country to provide protection and then a third paragraph where it states: “I have taken into account all of the claimant’s oral testimony and documentary evidence regarding her negligible attempts to seek state protection. In my view, the claimant’s evidence falls far short of what is needed to rebut the presumption of state protection for an enlightened monarchy like Wakanda.” The claimant had submitted two official records of complaints she had made to the Wakandan Police about being the object of reprisals by a member of the elite palace guard unit, the Dora Milaje. The receipts state that the claimant’s complaint was the subject of “follow up.” The claimant says, however, that nothing was done. **Is it worthwhile trying to appeal the RPD’s finding on state protection?**
        - Yes. In ***Cepeda-Guttierez***, the Federal Court states that a tribunal need not refer to every piece of evidence before it and that a statement that it had considered all the evidence would usually suffice (para 16). The Federal Court then says: “However, the more important the evidence that is not mentioned specifically and analyzed in the agency’s reasons, the more willing a court may be to infer from the silence that the agency made an erroneous finding of fact ‘without regard to the evidence’” (para 17). In this case, the police receipts are important evidence with respect to the claimant’s supposedly “negligible” efforts to seek state protection. Therefore, the RPD may be found to have erred based on ***Cepeda-Guttierez***.
    - Scenario 3: Hijda Morali claimed refugee protection on the basis of his sexual orientation. Homosexuality is illegal in his country of origin, and homosexuals are subject to significant discrimination and persecution. The RPD rejected his claim on the ground that it did not believe Mr. Morali was gay. After the rejection, Mr. Morali married another man at Victoria City Hall. He has submitted a marriage certificate, photographs of his wedding, as well as copies of Facebooks post announcing the wedding under a photograph of him kissing his new husband. The posts have been shared with friends and family in his home country. Mr. Morali has requested an oral hearing in his appeal record, in accordance with subparagraph 3(3)(d)(ii) of the RAD Rules. **Should an oral hearing be held? Please explain.**
        - IRPA, s 110(6) states **an oral hearing** may only be held by the RAD where there is **new documentary evidence**: that raises a serious issue with respect to the claimant’s **credibility**; that is **central** to the decision with respect to the claim; and that, if accepted, would justify allowing or rejecting the claim. 
        - Here, the central issue of the claim is Mr. Morali’s sexual orientation and, perhaps more important, whether he is **perceived** as gay **by potential agents of persecution in his home country**. The documentary evidence establishes he married a man and that this has become known by family and friends in his home country. Whether or not the marriage is “genuine”, knowledge of the marriage may be enough to put him at risk. Therefore, the RAD could bypass an oral hearing and overturn the RPD’s decision. If it is contemplating dismissing the appeal, however, it should likely hold an oral hearing to test the genuineness of the marriage and whether it would likely be seen as genuine by the claimant’s family and friends.
