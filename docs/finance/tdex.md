This is a [post from reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/PersonalFinanceCanada/comments/1jadl1w/transfer_50k_usd_to_cad_from_within_td/){:target="_blank"}. I've been bothered by the enormous hidden fees (through its wide spread of bid/offer price) of exchange business at TD.[^1] It seems I'm not the only one complaining about it. Some dudes came up with their solutions. 

[^1]: someone posted: I work at TD as a teller and if you go into the branch and ask for a better rate, any of the employees there can adjust the rate to the best rate possible that the system will allow in the moment. Especially with a large amount such as 50K, they’d be more than happy to help you out. From experience, we can actually increase the rate quite a bit and this is something I do everyday. Let me know if you have any questions, more than happy to help you

    I'm looking to transfer $50K USD from my Canadian-based TD USD account to my Canadian-based CAD account which are both at TD. Could anyone comment on using these services below or share their experience or suggestions. I'm leaning towards Wise. Thank you!

Perplexity generated the following solutions:

## 1. TD Foreign Exchange Service (Direct Conversion)

Use TD’s built-in currency conversion tool in EasyWeb:

- Log into EasyWeb → Select Transfers → Foreign Exchange (Canada/US).
- Choose your USD account as the source and CAD account as the destination.
- Confirm the exchange rate and submit.

**Costs:**

- TD applies a ~4% hidden fee via unfavorable exchange rates (e.g., mid-market rate: 1.31, TD rate: ~1.27)[3].
- Example: Converting $1,000 USD to CAD would lose ~$40 USD to fees.

**Pros:** Instant, no third-party involvement.

**Cons:** High effective fees, making it costly for large amounts.

## 2. Norbert’s Gambit (Low-Cost DIY Method)

A securities-based strategy to minimize fees:

- Open a TD Direct Investing account (if you don’t have one).
- Transfer USD from your TD USD account to the brokerage.
- Buy a USD-denominated ETF (e.g., DLR.U.TO).
- Journal shares to the CAD version (DLR.TO) by contacting TD.
- Sell the CAD-denominated ETF and transfer proceeds to your TD CAD account.

**Costs:**

- $9.99 USD per trade (buy/sell) + potential minor spread loss.
- Total fees: ~$20 USD for trades, ideal for transfers >$5,000.

**Pros:** Saves ~80% compared to TD’s forex rates.

**Cons:** Requires brokerage account and 2–3 business days[4][7].

## 3. Third-Party Forex Services

For better rates, use external providers like Wise or KnightsbridgeFX:

- Link your TD USD account to Wise.
- Convert USD to CAD at near-mid-market rates (~0.4% fee).
- Transfer converted CAD to your TD CAD account.

**Costs:**

- Wise: ~$4 USD fee per $1,000 transferred.
- KnightsbridgeFX: No fees for transfers >$10,000 (rate markup ~0.5–1%).

**Pros:** Better rates than TD, fast (1–2 days).

**Cons:** Requires external account setup[6][7].

## Key Considerations:

**Small amounts (<$1,000):** TD’s forex tool is simplest despite higher fees.

**Large amounts (>$5,000):** Norbert’s Gambit saves hundreds in fees.

**Urgency:** Wise balances speed and cost for moderate sums.
