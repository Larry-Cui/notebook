# Few Things to Know as New Immigrants 

This post is a summary of an article published by RBC, "[Moving to Canada? Five things you need to know about tax and residency](https://www.rbcwealthmanagement.com/en-asia/insights/moving-to-canada-five-things-you-need-to-know-about-tax-and-residency){:target="_blank"} "

## 183-day Tax Rule

Canada has a residence-based income tax system, which is very different from the territorial-based system one finds in regions like Hong Kong and Singapore. 

In a territorial-based system, residents are taxed on income based solely on where that income is earned. In Canada, residents pay taxes on their **global income** no matter where they earned it. 

For example, if someone is considered a deemed resident in Canada and has business interests in Hong Kong, they could end up paying Canadian taxes on the Hong Kong income. While Canada has tax treaties with Hong Kong, Singapore, mainland China and several other countries that limit the risk of double taxation, the resident will generally pay the higher rate between the two countries.

The 183-day rule applies to anyone who spends more than half of the year, or 183 days, in Canada. At that point they become a deemed resident.

But someone who remains in Canada for less than 183 days may also become a deemed resident if other factors come into play, such as owning Canadian assets, like real estate, or having a spouse or other dependents in the country.

## Capital Gains and Dividends

Capital gains and dividends are taxed in Canada, but not in Hong Kong or Singapore. 

This means that somebody moving from Singapore or Hong Kong to Canada could find themselves owing taxes on offshore investments.

Among many strategies, one possible way to deal with this is to sell the assets **before the move**, in order to trigger the capital gains before becoming a deemed resident in Canada.


## Disclose Your Full Wealth

It's a misconception that they will be taxed on the assets on their arrival if new immigrants disclose their foreign assets.

When you declare your foreign assets, you’re basically telling the Canadian government that you’ve acquired these foreign assets prior to your becoming a tax resident. This allows the government to establish a cost basis for the asset at the time of the move,

{==

meaning taxes will only be levied for any appreciation following arrival in Canada.

Not fully disclosing assets can result in fines from the Canadian Revenue Agency (CRA), and could also result in the CRA treating an asset as if it was acquired while in Canada, which could trigger additional taxes or an audit.
