## What Happens

A **Browser** sends a request to a **Server**, and the server sends back a response.

A typical number address should look like:

`https://216.58.211.206:443`

The `https` is the **Protocol**, the series of numbers in the middle is the **IP address**, and `443` is **Port Number** for `https` by default, and `80` for `http`.

**TCP/IP socket connection** is established and maintained during the whole communication process.

## Front-End vs Back-End

### Front-End

basics: `html` + `css` + `javascript`

frameworks: `angular1`, `react`, `GraphQL`, `Vue`, ...

### Back-End

Web server is a computer that is connected to the Internet, stores all files, and runs an `http` Server that understands requests and is capable of delivering response.

We usually also use Database.

Technologies: `node.js`, `mongoDB`, `MySQL`, `PostgreSQL`, `python`, _`php`_, ...

## Static vs Dynamic vs API

**Static:** developer uploads all files needed for the web pages. There's no back-end code or API.

**Dynamic:** web pages are usually built on the server, and connected to a database. It's called "**Server-side Rendering**".

**API:** Database -> Get Data in `json` format. Only Data is delivered. It's on the client's browser side to consume API data, rendering the final result. A "**Client-side Rendering**".
