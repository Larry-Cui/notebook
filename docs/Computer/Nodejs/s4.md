# Node.js - Under the Hood

## V8 and others

`node.js` dependencies are libraries that `node.js` depends on to work properly.

Two of the most important dependencies are "**V8**" engine and "**libuv**", a open source library focusing on "asynchronous IO". Both dependencies are basically written in `c++`.

## Processes and Threads

`node.js` is just running in "**ONE**" thread.

"**libuv**" gives us additional 4 or more threads by "Thread Pool". "Thread Pool" will be dealing with heavy tasks, like FS APIs, Cryptography, Compression, DNS lookups, that automatically offloaded to it by "Event Loop".

## Event Loop

It is all the application code that is inside call-back function, a function that is called as soon as some tasks are finished.

Some types of callback functions:

- Expired Timer Callbacks
  > ```js
  > setTimeout(() => console.log("time out!"));
  > ```
- I/O Polling and Callbacks
  > ```js
  > fs.readFile("file.txt", (error, data) => console.log("file read!"));
  > ```
- setImmediate callbacks
- Close callbacks

==Don't Block==

- :fontawesome-regular-hand-point-right: Don's use sync version of functions in `fs`, `crypto` and `zlib` modules
- :fontawesome-regular-hand-point-right: Don's perform complex calcuations
- :fontawesome-regular-hand-point-right: Be careful with `json` with large objects
- :fontawesome-regular-hand-point-right: Don's use complex regular expression

Guess the sequence of the following code execution?

```js
const fs = require("fs");
setImmediate(() => console.log("Immediate 1 finished!"));
setTimeout(() => console.log("Timer 2 finished!"), 50);
setTimeout(() => console.log("Timer 1 finished!"), 0);
fs.readFile("test-file.txt", () => console.log("I/O finished!"));
console.log("Hello from the top level code!");
```

Result:

```
Hello from the top level code!
Timer 1 finished!
Immediate 1 finished!
I/O finished!
Timer 2 finished!
```

Heavy jobs are offloaded to "thread pool" for multiple processing. Usually there are 4 threads in the pool, but we can config the pool size.

`process.env.UV_THREADPOOL_SIZE = 10`

## Event-driven Practice

We can require the "events" module and observe the instance by adding a specific trigger.

```js
// require module "events"
const EventEmitter = require("events");

// create new instance
const myEmitter = new EventEmitter();

// add listener to the instance
// Here we trigger on "newSale"
myEmitter.on("newSale", () => {
	console.log("There was a new sale!");
});

// send emitter to trigger
myEmitter.emit("newSale");
```

We can add a second listener to the same instance.

```js
// add 2nd listener
myEmitter.on("newSale", () => {
	console.log("Client Name: Larry");
});
```

We can even pass an argument to the listener.

```js
// pass an argument
myEmitter.on("newSale", (stock) => {
	console.log(`There are now ${stock} items left in the stock.`);
});

// send emitter to trigger
myEmitter.emit("newSale", 9);
```

<p markdown="1" class="highlight red">`events` is a module for general event loop application. We need `myEvent.emit` to specify the trigger event individually. In `http` module however, the `.emit` part is not necessary, as it has been integrated into the instance already.</p>

Now we use this add-on feature to re-draft the server instance.

```js
// import `http` module
const http = require("http");

// create the "server" instance
const server = http.createServer();

// the server instance can observe by
// adding `.on` and attach event "request"
server.on("request", (req, res) => {
	console.log("request received");
	res.end("Request received.");
});

// attach another event "close"
server.on("close", (req, res) => {
	console.log("Server closed");
});

// open the server
server.listen(8001, "127.0.0.1", () => {
	console.log("Waiting for requests...");
});
```

By the way, we can combine require and create into one step.

```js
const server = require("http").createServer();
```

## Streams

- :fontawesome-regular-hand-point-right: Perfect for handling large volumns of data, like videos
- :fontawesome-regular-hand-point-right: More efficient data processing in terms of memory and time

<!-- ![woman](../slides/pexels-khoa-vo-2347168-26052213.jpg) -->

An comparison sample to show the use of streams.

Normal way to read the entire file and send to user as response:

```js
// solution 1: load entire file
fs.readFile("test-file.txt", (error, data) => {
	if (error) console.log(error);
	res.end(data);
});
```

Now we try stream the file chunk:

```js
// solution 2: streams
const readable = fs.createReadStream("test-file.txt");
readable.on("data", (chunk) => {
	res.write(chunk);
});
readable.on("end", () => {
	res.end();
});
readable.on("error", (error) => {
	console.log(error);
	res.statusCode = 500;
	res.end("File not found!");
});
```

It looks better, but we still have a problem. The network speed is much slower than the fs reading speed, resulting in a clog of data in the memory. That's why we need `pipe` method.

```js
// solution 3
const readable = fs.createReadStream("test-file.txt");
readable.pipe(res);
// readableSource.pipe(writebaleDestination)
```

That's it! It is this simple.

## How Requiring Modules Really Works?

- :fontawesome-regular-hand-point-right: Each `js` file is treated as a separate module
- :fontawesome-regular-hand-point-right: `node.js` uses the **CommonJS module system**: `require()`, `exports` or `module.exports`
- :fontawesome-regular-hand-point-right: **ES module system** is used in browsers: `import`/`export`
- :fontawesome-regular-hand-point-right: There have been attempts to bring **ES modules** to `node.js` (`.mjs`), but they haven't been popular.

When the computer executes the code `require("module")`, the following steps happen:

- Resolving & loading: starting with core modules, then own modules at given directory, then go to `node_modules` for 3rd-party modules
- Wrapping: convert modules into functions
- Execution: these functions get executed
- Returning exports: `require` is A function! It returns **exports** of the required module
- Caching: modules are cached since the first time you require them. Later, when you require them again, you actually get them from cache.

### An example of write and export a module

```js
// define a class
class Calculator {
	add(a, b) {
		return a + b;
	}
}
// export the class
module.exports = Calculator;
```

### Another way to write a module

As we showed in previous part, the name of this module function is not necessary. We can write it alternatively,

```js
// just export a class without the name
module.exports = class {
	add(a, b) {
		return a + b;
	}
};
```

simple because we will give a name for the class/function in the `js` file that requiring the module.

```js
const C = require("./test-module-1");
const Cal = new C();
```

### The third way to write a module (use `exports`)

```js
exports.add = (a, b) => a + b;
```

In this way, we don't need to create a function/class before using it:

```js
const calc2 = require("./test-module-2");
console.log(calc2.add(4, 5));
```

You can also directly run the module this way. There will be no result delivered as the module just create some functions.

```js
require("./test-module-1")();
```
