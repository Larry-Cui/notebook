# Asynchronous JavaScript: Promises and Async/Await

`JavaScript` is asynchronous, and it relies on call-back functions to build its architecture. However, modern `js` has been more and more written using new tools, like "promises" and "async/await".

## Super Agent

It's a module that is good at retrieving data from APIs. Here is an example of how to use it.

```js
const superagent = require("superagent");

superagent
	.get(`https://dog.ceo/api/breed/retriever/images/random`)
	.end((error, result) => {
		console.log(result.body.message);
	});
```
