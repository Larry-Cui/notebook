## Enter and Exit Node.js

After you install the `node.js`, you can use `Terminal` to access it.

```js
// enter node.js
> node
```

```js
// exit node.js
> .exit
```

You can also press key combination to exit `node.js`:

++ctrl+d++

## Find global variables of node.js

press `tab` once or twice to check out all variables.

## Write and run a js file

- create a `index.js` for example
- go the file folder, type `node` followed by the file name `index.js`

## Use of a module

For example, if we want to use module `fs`, the file system module, we need to load the module to a variable first.

```js
// fs is "file system" module
const fs = require("fs");
```

### How to find modules for your current `node.js` version?

First, go to [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/en){:target="\_blank"}.

I'm using v22.12.0, so I go find the [related version of modules](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest-v22.x/api/index.html){:target="\_blank"}.

> ```js
> const textPre = "description of avocado";
> const textTogether = `This is ${textPre}`;

## Synchronous and Non-Synchronous

**Synchronous:** each line of code is executed one by one, the next line of code not being executed until the last one's execution is completed.

> **Blocking code:** as in synchronous execution model, the next line cannot be executed until the previous one is finished with execution, it is called blocking code.

**Asynchronous:** the execution of a heavy load code is running at the background, while the computer proceeds with the next line, not waiting for the result to come out. A call-back function will tell the computer what to do when the background-running code is finished with execution. This is called **Non-Blocking** code.

Asynchronous coding is important is because `node.js` is **single-threaded**.

Code Example:

```js
// we use same module `fs`, but this time, for its asynchronous function
fs.readFile("./txt/input.txt", "utf-8", (error, data) => console.log(data));
// the computer continue to execute the next line of code
console.log("reading file...");
```

<p class="highlight red" markdown="1">For this non-blocking purpose, the whole `node.js` code is built on call-back functions.</p>

### Callback Hell

When too many lawyers of callback functions are nested, it soon becomes hard to read and understand. It has been given a specific name: **Callback Hell**.

## Read and Write a file

```js
// read a file:
const textIn = fs.readFileSync("./txt/input.txt", "utf-8");
```

```js
// create some texts in a variable and write and save it to a file:
const textOut = `Why do they call it Bear Valley?' Emily asked. 
${textIn} \nCreated on ${Date.now()}`;
fs.writeFileSync("./txt/output.txt", textOut);
```

We can even have nested callback functions.

```js
// we use same module `fs`, but this time, for its asynchronous function
fs.readFile("./txt/start.txt", "utf-8", (error, data1) => {
	fs.readFile(`./txt/${data1}.txt`, "utf-8", (error, data2) =>
		console.log(data2)
	);
});
```

This is the code snippet on how to **write** a file asynchronously.

```js
fs.writeFile("./txt/final.txt", `${data2}\n${data3}`, "utf-8", (err) => {
	console.log("Your file has been written 😁");
});
```

## Creating a Simple Web Server

First, we need to use the "http" module.

```js
// introduce http function
const http = require("http");
```

Now we establish a server.

```js
// create a server
const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
	res.end("Hello from the server!");
});

// local host (computer) usually has this "127.0.0.1" address
server.listen(8001, "127.0.0.1", () => {
	console.log("Listening to requests on port 8001");
});
```

## Routing

<p class="highlight yellow">Routing means implementing different actions for different URLs.</p>

We use module `url` to help parse the parameter the browser sending to server.

A basic routing example:

```js
const http = require("http");

// we're gonna use "url" module
const url = require("url");

const server = http.createServer((req, res) => {
	const pathName = req.url;

	if (pathName == "/" || pathName == "/overview") {
		res.end("This is the OVERVIEW!");
	} else if (pathName == "/product") {
		res.end("This is the PRODUCT!");
	} else {
		// specify the head information
		res.writeHead(404, {
			"Content-type": "text/html",
			"my-own-type": "hello world!",
		});
		res.end("<h2>Page not Found!</h2>");
	}
});
```

## Building a simple API

Read a `json` file and send back information to the browser. Following the above code:

```js
else if (pathName == "/api") {
	// It's always a better practice to use directory variable `__dirname`.
	fs.readFile(`${__dirname}/dev-data/data.json`, "utf-8",
        (error, data) => {
		const productData = JSON.parse(data);
		// "200" means file found.
		res.writeHead(200, {
			"Content-type": "application/json",
		});
		res.end(data);
	});
}
```

It's not perfect however, as we don't want to read the file every time a request is initiated. We'd rather use **synchronous** code to read the `json` file once at the beginning.

```js
const data = fs.readFileSync(`${__dirname}/dev-data/data.json`, "utf-8");
const productData = JSON.parse(data);
```

## HTML Templating

### Building Templates

We use curly brackets and percentage marks to create "Place Holder":

```html
<h2 class="product__name">{%PRODUCTNAME%}</h2>
```

"Place Holder" can also be used in `html` tags:

```html
<div class="product__organic {%NOT_ORGANIC%}">
	<h5>Organic</h5>
</div>
```

It can even be used to include `html` codes:

```html
<div class="cards-container">{%CARD%}</div>
```

### Filling Templates

As for `json` file reading, we can also read all templates once at the beginning using synchronous method.

```js
const tempOverview = fs.readFileSync(
	`${__dirname}/templates/overview.html`,
	"utf-8"
);
const tempProduct = fs.readFileSync(
	`${__dirname}/templates/product.html`,
	"utf-8"
);
const tempCard = fs.readFileSync(`${__dirname}/templates/card.html`, "utf-8");
```

How to use the templates:

```js
// Overview page
if (pathName == "/" || pathName == "/overview") {
	res.writeHead(200, { "Content-type": "text/html" });
	res.end(tempOverview);
}
//...
```

But the above code is not good enough. We need to use the data from `json` to replace "Place Holders" with correct information. First, we'd like to read `json` file and convert it to an array.

```js
// read `json` file and store it
// to variable "data" as a string.
const data = fs.readFileSync(`${__dirname}/dev-data/data.json`, "utf-8");

// Parse the string to an array
const productData = JSON.parse(data);
```

Then, instead of output "tempOverview" template directly, we need to do three more steps:

- replace all "Place Holders" in card template with `json` data, one set of data for one card;
- Piece together all cards by `join` method;
- replace and insert the concatenated cards `html` to the "Overview" template, then output the result `html`.

Here below is the code for these steps.

```js
const cardsHtml = productData
	.map((element) => replaceTemplate(tempCard, element))
	.join(" ");
const output = tempOverview.replace("{%CARDS%}", cardsHtml);
res.end(output);
```

We haven't written the `replaceTemplate` function yet. Let's do it now:

```js
function replaceTemplate(htmlTemp, product) {
	let output;
	// instead of using quotation mark
	// here is `/   /g` for global replacement
	output = htmlTemp.replace(/{%PRODUCTNAME%}/g, product.productName);
	output = output.replace(/{%IMAGE%}/g, product.image);
	output = output.replace(/{%PRICE%}/g, product.price);
	output = output.replace(/{%PLACE%}/g, product.from);
	output = output.replace(/{%NUTRIENRS%}/g, product.nutrients);
	output = output.replace(/{%QUANTITY%}/g, product.quantity);
	output = output.replace(/{%DESCRIPTION%}/g, product.description);
	output = output.replace(/{%PRODUCT_ID%}/g, product.id);

	if (!product.organic)
		output = output.replace(/{%NOT_ORGANIC%}/g, "not-organic");

	return output;
}
```

## Parsing Variables from URLs

First, we have a link in the html with a query `?ID`.

```html
<a class="card__link" href="/product?id={%PRODUCT_ID%}"></a>
```

Once users click on the link, it will send the url with this id number to server. It's server's job to parse the url.

```js
// use "true" to parse the query
const pathURL = url.parse(req.url, true);
const query = pathURL.query;
const pathname = pathURL.pathname;
```

We take "product" pages as an example. Here is how we parse the url and output the relevant page:

```js
else if (pathname == "/product") {
		res.writeHead(200, { "Content-type": "text/html" });
		const product = productData[query.id];
		const output = replaceTemplate(tempProduct, product);
		res.end(output);
	}
//...
```

## Use My Own modules

Sometimes, we need to use a function across different `js` files. There's no way to load all `js` files together as we did in `html` files, but we can pack these functions into our own modules and import them if we'd like to use in later occasions.

First of all, we need to create our own module. In `node.js`, a module is nothing more than a standalone `js` file. Let's create a `replaceTemplate.js` file under `module` folder. You can of course use different names for the `js` file and folder.

Second, we move the function to the `replaceTemplate.js` file, it should be pre-fixed as,

```js
module.exports = function (htmlTemp, product) {
	// content of the function
};
```

Please note we don't give name to the function, as it's now a "module", and a "module" is referred to by its file name. We will be using this "module" in our `index.js` file as follows.

```js
// import own modules
// when importing, we can give
// this module a name we like
const replaceTemplate = require("./modules/replaceTemplate");
```

## NPM

We start by using `npm init` to recreate a `package.json` file.

## Packages and Installations

Let's install our first package. Use command line interface and type

`npm install slugify`

The first package `slugify` is installed in a fraction of second. You can also check out the status of the installation in `package.json` file,

```js
// ...
  "dependencies": {
    "slugify": "^1.6.6"
  }
```

Some packages are not essential for running of a project, but is beneficial to developing. When we install these pacakges, we need to signify it's for development purpose `npm install nodemon --save-dev`. You can see new lines added to the `package.json`,

```js
//...
  "devDependencies": {
    "nodemon": "^3.1.9"
  }
```

You will notice there's a folder under your project called `node_modules`, which is the place `npm` save all packages and their own dependencies.

The method we used to install package has one drawback. It installs packages to your local folder and becomes effective to the very project only. If you want install a package once and have it available to all projects across your computer, you need do it this way:

`sudo npm install nodemon --global`

### nodemon

As I understand it, `nodemon` is a word combining `node` and `monitor`. It allows you to see the changes of the result without exiting and restarting `node index.js` every time you modify and save the `js` files. The command is like this:

`nodemon index.js`

### Run Packages Locally

In `package.json` file, you modify the `scripts` part, adding the following:

`"start": "nodemon index.js"`

Then in command line, you can just type `npm run start`. In this way, you are actually using local package `nodemon`. In fact, you can even omit `run` in the above command.

---

After install a module, we need to use it in our files.

```js
// require 3rd party modules
const slugify = require("slugify");
```

An example of how to use `slugify`

```js
// example of using a package `slugify`
const slugs = productData.map((element) =>
	slugify(element.productName, { lower: true })
);
```

## Package Versioning and Updating

### Install

We can install a specified version of package. For example:

`npm install slugify@1.0.0`

We can then run `npm outdated`. It should give us the outdated packaged installed under our project.

We can update the package by `npm update slugify`.

Sometimes, if we are bothered by complex versions, we can just install the latest one,

`npm install slugify@latest`

### Uninstall

It's easy to delete/uninstall a package:

`npm uninstall slugify`

### Reinstate node_modules folder

You don't want to share with other people or copy this folder to different computers as, first, it may contains tons of files and become extremely large, and second, you can always rebuild this folder from `package.json` and `package-lock.json` by typing:

`npm install`
