This project is inspired by [Vera Moln√°r](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vera_Moln%C3%A1r){:target="\_blank"}'s [(Des)Ordres](https://dam.org/museum/artists_ui/artists/molnar-vera/des-ordres/){:target="\_blank"}' from 1974.

## Coding Knacks

The codes for this project is simple and straight forward, with only one exception: the recursive function within a class.

When I wrote the class for single box/square, I planned to use recursive method `show()` within the class. It's not working if you call `this.show()` within the `show()` method, as the scope of `this` will be different in each loop. Instead, `self` is used here.

```js
show(side) {
// this is the key to solve scope issue
	let self = this;
	if (side < threshold) return;

	// main body of coding ...

	// recursive part
	const newSide = side - decrement;
	self.show(newSide);
}
```

Here is the [full length code](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1QHrZlfslRRhHeMJ34YnAVNZpPS1CYsHv/view?usp=sharing){:target="\_blank"} of this project.
