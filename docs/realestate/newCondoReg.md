# Request Process of New Condo Registration

New condo transfer registration is unique in that _the Condominium Property Act_ does not permit transfers of new condominium units to utilize the Pending Registration Queue, Western Protocol, or Gap Insurance to close real estate transactions.

In order to release funds to the developer, the title must be issued in the registered owners’ name. The Land Titles Office (LTO) has developed processes for the solicitor acting on behalf of builders/developers or purchasers of newly constructed condominiums to request expedited registration, **effective December 2, 2021**.

## Summary of Process

There are two ways to submit registration to Land Titles Office, by delivery of hard copies, or by [online submission](https://spin.alt.alberta.ca){:target="\_blank"}. Here we discuss the online submission only, as it's a more convenient and popular way these days.

The process is as follows:

1. Submit the transfer registration just as in any other deals, except that in "DRR Special Instructions", indicate: **ATTN SURVEYS, NEW CONDO REGISTRATION**
2. Submit the request to [ACT@gov.ab.ca](mailto: ACT@gov.ab.ca){:target="\_blank"} with the subject line as: **ATTN SURVEYS, NEW CONDO REGISTRATION**, and attach completed “**Request for Expedited Condominium Registration**” form to email request

> It is not required to attach completed “Request for Expedited Condominium Registration” form with digital ALTO submission package. The form is only required to be sent to the online email [ACT@gov.ab.ca](mailto: ACT@gov.ab.ca){:target="\_blank"} for E-Submissions during request for Expedited Condo Transfer.
