## Prospective Students<br>Apply to Online Learning at Allard Law

### Step 1: Apply to UBC as a non-degree student

Complete an application through the [BC Education Planner website](https://apply.educationplannerbc.ca/){:target=" \_blank"}. You may want to check out UBC instructions on how to apply for this application [here](https://students.ubc.ca/enrolment/courses/non-degree-studies/non-degree-studies-unclassified/#how-to-apply){:target=" \_blank"}.

When you receive an 8-digit UBC Identification number, please send UBC law school this number with your application.

After you submit your application on [BC Education Planner website](https://apply.educationplannerbc.ca/){:target=" \_blank"} portal, UBC Admissions will email you with a confirmation of your application and next steps.

### Step 2: Submit Requested Documents

**NCA Assessment Report and Academic Transcripts**

If your file has been assessed by the NCA:

Please ask the NCA to add your NCA Assessment, along with the academic transcripts on file with the NCA, to the NCA’s transcript portal. The NCA will email our office once this is completed.

**English Language Requirements**

English language proficiency test results are required for all applicants who have completed a degree program (equivalent to a bachelors or higher) from an institution where English was not the primary language of instruction in the entire institution – not just the degree program.

Please visit our Eligibility page for our English Language Proficiency test score [requirements](https://allard.ubc.ca/programs/online-learning/admissions-requirements){:target=" \_blank"}.

### Step 3: Wait for Program Assessment

Once all of the above steps are complete and all supporting documents have been received by the Online Learning at Allard Law staff, an assessment can be made to determine your eligibility for admission to take the courses we offer.

If your application is successful, Online Learning at Allard Law will recommend you for admission to UBC through either Unclassified or Access Studies.
