## FTLP of UC: Admission Requirements

<p class="highlight red">The introduction below is centered around the program offered by the University of Calgary. <a href="https://www.ualberta.ca/en/law/programs/itlp/index.html" target="_blank">University of Alberta in Edmonton</a> and <a href="https://allard.ubc.ca/programs/graduate-programs/master-laws-common-law" target="_blank">University of British Columbia</a> are also offering similar programs. Please click on the links above for details.</p>

The Foreign Trained Lawyers Program (FTLP) is a **12-month** Post-bachelorâ€™s Certificate offered by the Faculty of Law at the University of Calgary for internationally trained lawyers who wish to become accredited to practice common law in Canada.

This is an **off-line**, **full-time**, and **dedicated**[^1] program toward obtaining a license to practice in Canada.

[^1]: Which means unless approved by NCA separately, an LL.M. program cannot replace this program.

The minimum requirements for admission to the FTLP Post-Bachelor's certificate are:

- [x] A completed law degree (LLB, JD, or equivalent)

- [x] A valid [National Committee on Accreditation (NCA) Assessment Report](https://nca.legal/process/assessment-process/){:target=" \_blank"}, issued within the last five (5) years
