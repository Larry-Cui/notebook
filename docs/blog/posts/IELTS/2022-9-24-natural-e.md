???+ quote "1. Lost Dutchman's Gold Mine"

    - **Prospectors** came to the desert hoping to find gold and silver in the mountains.
    - One legend **in particular** has captured the imaginations of Arizonans, even to this day.
    - In 1868, a farmer moved to Phoenix. He had dreams of **striking it rich**.
    - He and his **burro** used to disappear for days at a time into the Superstition Mountains. Every so often, he **emerged** from the mountains with big chunks of solid gold.
    - His eyes **darted from side to side** and sweat dripped from his forehead.
    - Before Billy realized what was happening, they were at the **outskirts of the city** and climbing into the foothills.
    - Mr. Martinez **gripped the steering wheel with two hands** and gazed straight ahead. Then he pressed down even harder on the gas pedal. “Holy geez-grubbers!” Billy **blurted out**.
    - Their truck **veered off** onto a bumpy, dirt road.
    - “Oh gosh,” Billy sighed as he slapped his forehead in disbelief. They’ve gone mad, **absolutely bonkers**!
    - Mr. Martinez carefully pulled the truck off the right-hand side of the road and parked it behind two **mesquite** `[mǝs-gee-t]` trees.
    - He found a flashlight, two cans of beans, a full canteen, **a musty pillow,** and an old Mexican blanket.
    - Billy looked around at the **Sonoran Desert**. There were just sharp **cacti**, loose rocks, steep mountains, and a **scorching sun**.
    - He knows that rattlesnakes, scorpions, coyotes, and **Gila `[hee-la]` monsters** roamed this desert.
    - Knives can be used for cooking, **whittling wood**, or hurting.
    - “Do you think that’s a **monsoon storm** coming this way?” Billy wondered out loud.
    - It wound back and forth through the foothills and over **dry washes**.
    - Next to the trail, old **saguaro `[sǝ-wah-row]` cacti** stood like the gatekeepers of these desert mountains.
    - The three stared silently into the **mesmerizing** fire.
    - Everybody has their theories. Some believe Waltz hid the entrance with rocks. Others believe an earthquake covered it up. **Skeptics** claim that it is just a myth.
    - “And on the next day, they found **a nugget of gold** on the trail,” he whispered. “It was the size of a baseball.”
    - One howl turned into **a chorus of yapping and howling**.
    - “Keep yourselves hydrated, boys,” he said, “because **there’s no telling** how fast we might have to run down this hill!”
    - Now empty out your packs. Let’s **stash** everything behind these trees.
    - At the mine’s entrance, the old burro was tied to a rock. The **tattered rope** was fastened around her neck by just **one loose knot**.
    - Billy **cringed**, “Be quiet, you guys!” he screamed down the tunnel. “He could hear you!”
    - “Jacob! Billy! Heather!” Mr. Martinez said in an **exasperated `[ig-zes-per-rated]`** tone. “I’m trying to teach class here. What should I do with you three?”
