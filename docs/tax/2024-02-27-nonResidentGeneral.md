As a non-resident of Canada, you pay tax on income you receive from sources in Canada. Generally, Canadian income received by a non-resident is subject to **Part XIII** tax or **Part I** tax.

## Part XIII tax

### Types of Taxable Income[^1]

- dividends
- rental and royalty payments
- pension payments
- old age security pension
- Canada Pension Plan and Quebec Pension Plan benefits
- retiring allowances
- registered retirement savings plan payments
- registered retirement income fund payments
- annuity payments
- management fees

[^1]: Generally, the interest that you receive or that is credited to you is exempt from Canadian withholding tax if the payer is unrelated (arm's length) to you. For more information, see the Canada Revenue Agency's [Non-resident tax calculator](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/e-services/non-resident-tax-calculator-disclaimer.html){:target=" \_blank"}.

### Payment of Part XIII tax

Canadian payers, including financial institutions, must **deduct** Part XIII tax when the income is paid or credited to you.

The Part XIII tax deducted is your **final tax obligation** to Canada on this income.

The usual Part XIII tax rate is `25%` (unless a tax treaty between Canada and your home country reduces the rate).

Part XIII tax is not refundable by way of filing a Canadian tax return. Therefore, you are **not required to file a Canadian tax return** to report the income.

## Part I tax

### Types of Taxable Income

- income from employment in Canada or from a business carried on in Canada
- employment income from a Canadian resident for your employment in another country if, under the terms of a tax treaty between Canada and your country of residence, the income is exempt from tax in your country of residence
- certain income from employment outside Canada, if you were a resident of Canada when the duties were performed
- taxable part of Canadian scholarships, fellowships, bursaries, and research grants
- taxable capital gains from **Disposing of certain Canadian property**
- income from [providing services in Canad](https://www.canada.ca/en/revenue-agency/services/tax/international-non-residents/information-been-moved/rendering-services-canada.html){:target=" \_blank"} other than in the course of regular and continuous employment

### Elaboration on "Disposing of certain Canadian property"

#### Types of Taxable Canadian Property (TCP)

It applies to the disposition and acquisition of the following properties:

- real property situated in Canada
- life insurance policies in Canada
- resource property situated in Canada
- timber resource property situated in Canada
- depreciable property that is taxable Canadian property
- eligible capital property that is a taxable Canadian property
- any interest in or option in respect of the above (whether or not that property exists)

For dispositions after March 4, 2010, the TCP referred to above generally also includes the following:

- real or immovable property situated in Canada
- property used or held in a business carried on in Canada
- designated insurance property belonging to an insurer
- **shares of corporations** that are not listed on a designated stock exchange, an interest in a partnership, or an interest in a trust, **if** at any time in the previous 60-month period, more than 50% of the fair market value of the shares or interest was derived (otherwise than through a corporation, partnership or trust the shares or interests in which were not themselves taxable Canadian property at the particular time) from one or any combination of:

      - real or immovable property situated in Canada
      - resource property situated in Canada
      - timber resource property situated in Canada
      - options or interests in any of the above

- **shares of corporations** listed on a designated stock exchange, a share of a mutual fund corporation or unit of a mutual fund trust, **if** at any time in the previous 60-month period:

      - 25% or more of the issued shares of any class, or 25% or more of the issued units, belonged to either the taxpayer or the taxpayer and persons with whom the taxpayer did not deal with at arm's length
      - more than 50% of the fair market value of the shares or unit was derived from one or any combination of:

        - real or immovable property situated in Canada
        - resource property situated in Canada
        - timber resource property situated in Canada
        - options or interests in any of the above

- an option or interest in any property listed above

#### Excluded properties

Some Canadian properties are excluded from the above requirements and are defined as excluded properties. These properties include the following:

- a property that is a taxable Canadian property solely because a provision of the Income Tax Act deems it to be a taxable Canadian property
- a property that is inventory of a business carried on in Canada (other than real or immovable property situated in Canada, a Canadian resource property or a timber resource property)
- **a security** that is

      - listed on a recognized stock exchange
      - either: (a) the share of the capital stock of a corporation, or (b) SIFT wind-up entity equity

- a unit of a mutual fund trust
- a bond, debenture, bill, note, mortgage, hypothecary claim or similar obligation
- property of a non-resident insurer that is licensed to carry on an insurance business in Canada and does so
- property of an authorized foreign bank that carries on a Canadian banking business
- an option in respect of property (whether or not such property is in existence) referred to in any of the items above
- an interest, or for civil law a right, in property referred to in any of the items above
- a property that is, at the time of its disposition, a treaty-exempt property of the person (see note below)

#### Do I need a taxation number?

Individuals:

All non-resident individuals who dispose of a property and who are required to notify the Canada Revenue Agency (CRA) of the disposition should have a Canadian taxation number.

If you do not have a SIN but previously filed a Canadian income tax return, you may have been assigned a Temporary Tax Number (TTN) or an Individual Tax Number (ITN).

Corporations:

A Business Number (BN) is a registration number for businesses. To obtain a BN, see Business Registration Online (BRO) or contact the Business Windows Section at one of our designated tax services offices. A list of these offices is available at Doing Business in Canada - GST/HST Information for Non-Residents.

#### When should I notify the CRA of a disposition or proposed disposition of a property?

The non-resident vendor must notify the CRA about the disposition (notification is required within `10` days of the date the property was disposed of) or proposed disposition by completing the applicable notification forms and sending them **to the CRA along with the payment** or acceptable security to cover the resulting tax payable. These forms include T2062, T2062A and T2062B.

#### Are there situations where I am not required to notify CRA of the disposition of a property?

Since March 5, 2010, if you have disposed of certain properties that do not derive their value principally from real or immovable property situated in Canada, you do not have to notify the CRA of the disposition. These properties include certain:

- shares of corporations
- interests in a trust
- units of a unit trust

#### How will I determine if the property that I own derives its value, currently or within the previous 60 months, principally from real or immovable property (including Canadian resource property and timber resource property) situated in Canada?

For shares of a corporation, obtain a declaration from the corporation certifying that the value of the shares is not principally derived, and has not been for the previous 60 months, from real or immovable property (including Canadian resource property and timber resource property) situated in Canada.

For a capital interest in a trust or a unit of a unit trust, obtain a declaration from the trust that the value of the trust is not principally derived, and has not been for the previous 60 months, from real or immovable property (including Canadian resource property and timber resource property) situated in Canada.

#### Purchaser's liability

If a Certificate of Compliance (Form T2064 or Form T2068) is not issued and the property is not excluded property, the purchaser may become liable to pay a specified amount of tax that arises from the disposition on behalf of the vendor.

In this case, the purchaser is entitled to withhold `25%` (`50%` on certain types of property) of the proceeds minus the amount of the certificate limit, if any, from the proceeds.

- have to pay tax
- want to claim a refund

When completing your tax return:

- You may be entitled to claim certain deductions or credits
