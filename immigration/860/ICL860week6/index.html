<summary>Guideline 8: Accessibility to IRB Proceedings</summary>
<ul>
<li>IRB, <a href="https://www.irb-cisr.gc.ca/en/legal-policy/policies/Pages/GuideDir08.aspx" target="_blank">Chairperson’s Guideline 8: Accessibility to IRB Proceedings — Procedural Accommodations and Substantive Considerations</a> (October 31, 2023​)</li>
<li><strong>Anyone</strong> participating in a proceeding at the IRB can make a request for accommodation. This includes clients, but also counsel and other witnesses.</li>
<li><strong>Requests for accommodations</strong> must be made in accordance with the relevant Rules of the Division. You can request a <strong>case conference</strong> prior to the hearing to discuss the specifics of an accommodation. </li>
<li>The Guideline also provides guidance to Members to avoid reliance on <strong>myths, stereotypes, and incorrect assumptions</strong> relating to vulnerabilities, disabilities, and/or personal characteristics in their decision-making process. When you observe that the Member or the opposing counsel is relying on these myths, stereotypes and incorrect assumptions in their questioning, you may <strong>object to</strong> their questions on the basis that they are not adhering to this Guideline.</li>
<li>Trauma-informed adjudication principles. Members must:<ul>
<li>lead the proceeding with sensitivity to help <strong>prevent re-traumatization</strong> through the IRB decision-making process; </li>
<li><strong>anticipate</strong> the possibility that trauma may impact a person's memory and ability to provide testimony and </li>
<li>create a <strong>safe adjudicative environment</strong> for all participants to facilitate the giving of testimony. </li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</details>

<summary>Designated Representatives, Accessibility, and Related Situations</summary>
<ul>
<li>A designated representative is a person who may make decisions and representations on behalf of a <strong>claimant</strong> who is younger than 18 or who is unable to appreciate the nature of the proceedings before the RPD or RAD.</li>
<li><strong>Designated representatives</strong> must be 18 or older, they must be able to understand the nature of the proceedings before the Refugee Protection Division, or RPD, and they must not have interests that conflict with the claimant’s. Parents are usually the designated representative for their children.</li>
<li>The Federal Court’s decision in <em>Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration) v. Patel</em>, <a href="https://canlii.ca/t/1xv43" target="_blank">2008 FC 747</a> discusses their role.<ul>
<li>[38] The Court therefore finds that the Board is not unreasonable or incorrect when it fails to explicitly address the subjective fear of the minor child. <strong>It was open to the Board to infer the subjective fear of the minor child from the evidence presented,</strong> including the testimony of the child’s designated representative who was speaking on his behalf.</li>
<li>[45] The Court has constantly recognized that a tribunal is required to assess the cumulative impact of the hardships faced by the claimant. <strong>Therefore, even if none of the individual harms feared by the applicant are persecutory when viewed individually, the combined or cumulative effect of these harms may be persecutory.</strong> In this way, the cumulative effect of “merely” discriminatory acts can amount to persecution. The tribunal is required to assess the circumstances of the claimant, including the claimant’s age, when assessing whether or not the harm feared amounts to persecution.</li>
<li>[58] The applicant submits that humanitarian and compassionate considerations have no place in the determination of whether or not a claimant is a Convention refugee or a person in need of protection. And that the Board is required to make a determination on the basis of the factors set out in sections 96 and 97 of the Act. <strong>Any humanitarian and compassionate factors raised by a particular claimant, such as the best interests of the child, can only be fully considered once a determination is made on the issue of whether a claimant merits protection in Canada.</strong></li>
<li>[63] In addition, the <em>Guidelines on Children Refugee Claimants</em> clearly states that “refugee children have different requirements from adult refugees when they are seeking refugee status”. For instance, the Guidelines provide that in determining the procedure to follow when considering the refugee claim of a child, the Board should give primary consideration to the “best interests of the child”. It also states that: “<strong>the ‘best interests of the child’ should be given primary consideration at all stages of the processing of these claims</strong>”.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<details class="note">
<summary>Principles for Evaluating Credibility</summary>
<ul>
<li>Three most important principles regarding credibility:<ul>
<li>First, the principle from <em>Maldonado</em> that the evidence of a refugee protection claimant is to be <strong>presumed true unless there is a reason to doubt</strong> their truthfulness. This presumption may be rebutted. Examples of credibility concerns that may rebut the presumption of truthfulness are listed in <em>Rahal</em> and <em>Magonza</em>. They include <strong>contradictions</strong> or <strong>inconsistencies</strong> in the evidence, findings based on <strong>implausibility</strong>, and findings based on the <strong>demeanour</strong> of a claimant or witness.</li>
<li>Second, fairness requires that any <strong>doubts</strong> about credibility must be <strong>put to a claimant</strong> in order for an adverse inference to be fair. The requirement of giving notice is discussed in the IRB’s guide to <a href="https://irb.gc.ca/en/legal-policy/legal-concepts/Pages/Credib.aspx" target="_blank">Assessment of Credibility in Claims for Refugee Protection</a> (December 31, 2020).</li>
<li>Third, as stated in <em>Rahal</em> at paragraph 46, “where a decision turns on credibility, it is incumbent on the RPD [or RAD] to provide reasons for its assessment given the importance of the issues at stake in a refugee claim.” The <strong>RPD or RAD must explain</strong> why it has rejected a claimant’s explanation or response to the concerns raised about credibility.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details class="note">
<summary>From Theory to Practice: Designated Representatives, Accessibility, and Related Situations</summary>
<ul>
<li>Scenario 1: A local shelter has referred a client to you. She is a 15-year-old girl who crossed the border irregularly into Canada and made a claim for refugee protection. While young, she is exceptionally mature and clearly able to grasp the nature of her upcoming hearing before the Refugee Protection Division (RPD). She tells you that she has not secured representation and no one has been helping her with her claim. What steps should you take?<ul>
<li>Subrule 20(1) of the <em>Refugee Protection Division Rules</em> states that “[i]f counsel or if an officer believes that the Division should designate a representative for the claimant … because the claimant … is under 18 years of age … counsel or the officer must without delay notify the Division in writing.” On the facts given, you do not know whether an officer notified the RPD that they believe it should name a representative for the claimant. Therefore, <strong>you should write the RPD write away to advise them</strong> of your belief that they must <strong>appoint a designated representative for her</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scenario 2: Your client is an elderly man, about 84 years old, who was a victim of torture in his country of origin. You believe his age and trauma will significantly affect his ability to give coherent testimony about his experiences before the RPD. What steps should you take?<ul>
<li>You should consider seeking <strong>procedural accommodations</strong> to ensure your client has a fair opportunity to present his case. To do so, you will need to make an application (see rule 50 of the RPD Rules; see paragraph 12 of Chairperson’s Guideline 8). Such an <strong>application should be made as soon as possible</strong> (Chairperson’s Guideline 8, paragraph 11). If possible, you should seek to support the claim with <strong>psychological evidence</strong> (Chairperson’s Guideline 8, paragraph 13). </li>
<li>As part of the application, you should request appropriate procedural accommodation. <strong>The specifics of what you should request will depend on your client.</strong> It may be that creating a more <strong>informal</strong> setting, varying the <strong>order</strong> of questioning will be sufficient, or asking for a <strong>support</strong> person to be present will suffice (see Chairperson’s Guideline 8, paragraph 10). </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scenario 3: Your client is a woman from Iran. Her and her husband’s claim was rejected by the RPD, where she was represented by other counsel. You asked to meet with them separately. While meeting with her to prepare her appeal, she tells you for the first time that prison guards raped her. The reason she did not reveal the rape earlier because her husband was with her during all her meetings with counsel, as well as at the RPD hearing. How might you bring the allegation of rape <strong>before the Refugee Appeal Division</strong>? <ul>
<li>Your client might swear an <strong>affidavit</strong> or make a statutory declaration detailing her experience in the prison. You would then have to include that affidavit or statutory declaration as new evidence in the perfected appeal record and call the RAD’s attention to it (see Refugee Appeal Division Rules, subrule 3(3)(d)(i) and (e)).</li>
<li>You also need to include <strong>argument as to why this new evidence should be accepted</strong> (RAD Rules, subrule 3(3)(g)(iii)). <strong>Subsection 110(4) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act states that a person who is the subject of an appeal may only present evidence that is “new”,</strong> including evidence that the “person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection.”</li>
<li>Here you may argue that due to the husband’s presence during meetings with counsel and at the RPD hearing, in the circumstances your client could not reasonably have been expected to present evidence of her rape at the time of the rejection.</li>
<li>In support, you may cite <strong>section D.1 of Chairperson’s Guideline 4</strong>, on <strong>gender-based claims</strong>, which states: “Women from societies where the preservation of one's virginity or marital dignity is the cultural norm may be reluctant to disclose their experiences of sexual violence in order to keep their "shame" to themselves and not dishonour their family or community.” </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scenario 4: Your client is making a claim based on their sexual orientation. During the hearing, the RPD member begins asking them about their sexual experiences since coming to Canada. When your client says they has not had any, the RPD member asks, “Why not? After all, there’re no laws against homosexual behaviour here.” Should you intervene?<ul>
<li>You may want to <strong>intervene</strong> to remind them that it is <strong>inappropriate to rely on stereotypes</strong> when adjudicating claims based on sexual orientation and/or gender identity or expression (Chairperson’s Guideline 9, section 6).</li>
<li>You may specifically want to bring their attention to the fact that it is a stereotype to think that “<strong>[i]ndividuals with diverse SOGIE would actively participate in LGBTIQ+ culture in Canada, including frequenting LGBTIQ+-predominant areas and social establishments, or be involved in community organizations and groups.</strong>” (Chairperson’s Guideline 9, section 6, last bullet point) </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Scenario 5: Before the RPD, a family of claimants included a father, his wife, and their 5-year-old child. The father was named the designated representative of the child. The RPD rejected the claim of the father and the child, but accepted the claim of the mother. The mother and father divorced in the days before the RPD released its decision. The mother was granted custody of the child. You are the RAD member. Should the father continue to serve as the designated representative for the child? <ul>
<li>Recall that the RAD must act in the best interests of the child (Chairperson’s Guideline 3, section I). The Guideline also contemplates situations where it is no longer appropriate for a designated representative to continue in that role (see section II).</li>
<li>Subrule 23(1) of the RAD Rules states that if the RPD named a designated representative for a claimant, that <strong>person is deemed to have been designated by the RAD unless the RAD orders otherwise</strong>.</li>
<li>Subrule 23(5) of the RAD Rules states that a designated representative must: be 18 years of age or older; understand the nature of the proceedings; be willing and able to act in the best interests of the person who is the subject of the appeal; and not have interests that conflict with those of the person who is the subject of the appeal.</li>
<li>the RAD may wish to name an <strong>independent designated representative</strong> (i.e., neither the mother nor father) to act on the child’s behalf.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<summary>From Theory to Practice: Evaluating Credibility</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Scenario 1 (Evidence):</strong> The claimant alleges a fear of his ex-wife’s family, as well as of discrimination amounting to persecution against his ethnic group. In his Basis of Claim form and testimony, he said that after having been attacked by thugs in December 2018 and losing his job as an electrician because he was injured, he travelled from his home country to a neighbouring European country for work after obtaining a passport in May 2019. “I lost my job and I … I knew that I cannot find job so probably I would go somewhere to find the work … That country is not far from mine, I would be working around 400 kilometres from us, so I could come home to … to visit.” He visited home once more in September 2019. During his visit home he was attacked, and decided to come to Canada with his family to claim protection.<ul>
<li>RPD’s Finding: “[34] The claimant alleges he was attacked in December 2018 so severely that he could not work for a time as an electrician, there being no workers’ rights for members of his ethnic group. If the claimant was in fact injured in such an attack, his decision to obtain a passport so he could work in the neighbouring country is strange behaviour, inconsistent with a fear of persecution. I therefore draw an adverse credibility inference.” </li>
<li>Suggested Response: This credibility finding is based on the RPD’s conclusion that the claimant’s actions are inconsistent with his alleged fear of persecution; in other words, it is like a finding based on delay in leaving the country where he fears persecution. Therefore, as set out in <em>Zeah</em>, the <strong>RPD must assess whether the claimant has provided a satisfactory explanation to its concerns.</strong> Here the <strong>claimant provided such an explanation</strong> – that he needed to work, and wanted to work close to home. It might still be open to the RPD to find this explanation insufficient, but it must explain as much. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Scenario 2 (Evidence):</strong> The claimant is a member of an ethnic minority group with a sixth-grade education. He alleges that he faces discrimination amounting to persecution. In his Basis of Claim form he wrote that he was fired from his job in construction after he and some colleagues went on strike to protest the fact that they were paid less because of their ethnicity. The following testimony was given at the RPD hearing: (omitted)<ul>
<li>RPD’s Finding; “[25] The claimant embellished the part of his story surrounding his job loss to enhance his claim. In his Basis of Claim form, he described the job loss as the result of a strike, whereas it appears no actual strike, as that word is normally understood, took place. The claimant was never fired, but left of his own volition when his manager refused to give in to his demands on the part of himself and a small group of disaffected fellow workers. This is hardly a case of not being able to find work. It is a case of being unhappy with the terms of the work that was available. I therefore draw an adverse credibility finding.”</li>
<li>Suggested Response: <em>Rahal</em> at para 43 states that contradictions that underpin a negative credibility finding must be real as opposed to illusory and that <strong>the RPD “cannot seize on truly trivial or minute contradictions to reject a claim.”</strong> Here, the supposed inconsistency between the “strike” mentioned in the Basis of Claim form and the events recounted in the claimant’s testimony seem to be trivial. They also seem to turn on a technical definition of the word strike that perhaps eludes the claimant, given his level of education. Further, the testimony given distinction does not support the RPD’s finding that the claimant actually chose to leave his job. The claimant gave uncontradicted evidence about how firings took place at his workplace.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Scenario 3 (Evidence):</strong> The claimant is a young woman from Nigeria who claims protection based on her former membership in the Movement for the Actualization of the Sovereign State of Biafra (MASSB). In her Basis of Claim form and again in testimony, she said she had belonged to the group from 2005 to 2013. Further, the claimant provided a letter from a friend and secretary to the movement attesting to her membership. However, the documentary evidence in the National Documentation Package includes a statement from a lawyer with MASSB indicating that it does not provide letters to support asylum claims. In post-hearing submissions, the claimant provided a follow-up letter from her friend explaining that the lawyer’s statement in the NDP does not reflect a consistent policy.<ul>
<li>RPD’s Finding: The RPD made no adverse credibility findings. Nonetheless it rejected the claim because it found the claimant had not established on a balance of probabilities that she had been a member of MASSB: “I decline to give any weight to the letters provided by the claimant to prove her membership in MASSB. I have no evidence before me as to whether the author of the letter, whom the claimant admits is a friend, holds a position with the group. In the absence of such confirmation, I prefer the evidence found in the National Documentation Package, which is subject to quality assurance by the research directorate.” </li>
<li>Suggested Response: <strong>It is open to the RPD to prefer certain evidence to other contradictory evidence.</strong> In this case, you might nonetheless argue that the RPD’s finding that the claimant is not a member of the MASSB is in effect an adverse credibility finding, since <strong>her testimony and evidence of membership is uncontradicted.</strong> <strong>By requiring corroborating evidence the RPD is in effect failing to follow the presumption of truthfulness from <em>Maldonado</em>.</strong> Indeed, in a case called <em>Ahortor v. Canada (Minister of Employment and Immigration)</em> (1993), 21 Imm. L.R. (2d) 39 (F.C.T.D.), the Federal Court-Trial Division (as it was then) found that the <strong>corollary of the presumption of truthfulness from <em>Maldonado</em> is that if a claimant’s account is uncontradicted and credible, there is no legal requirement to provide independent evidence to corroborate the claimant’s sworn testimony.</strong> Further, as Evans Cameron notes in her book, the Court has found that the <strong>RPD should not find evidence to be unreliable simply because it comes from a friend of the claimant</strong> (see Evans Cameron, “The Wrong Mistake” at pp 70-71.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Scenario 4 (Evidence):</strong> The claimant alleges that she is claiming refugee protection in Canada because she does not want her daughter (a co-claimant) to be subjected to female genital mutilation in her home country. When asked why she could not find safety by moving to Big City, she said that her brother lived there. He was a lawyer working in the federal justice department. He would be able to track her down in Big City.<ul>
<li>RPD’s Finding: The RPD found that it was implausible that the claimant’s brother, who is a lawyer, would help her family track her and her daughter down: “I find it implausible that the claimant’s well-educated brother would collaborate with his family members in order that FGM performed.”</li>
<li>Suggested Response: This seems like a case where the RPD has made an improper implausibility finding. In <em>Rahal</em> at paragraph 44, the Federal Court says that “a finding of implausibility must be rational and must also be duly sensitive to cultural differences. It must also be clearly expressed and the basis for the finding must be apparent in the tribunal’s reasons.” In this case, the implausibility finding seems not to be sensitive to potential cultural differences. In particular, the RPD may not be taking into account that in the claimant’s culture, <strong>education may not determine the stance an individual</strong> takes with respect to practices like female genital mutilation. Further, as Evans Cameron notes: “Understanding across cultures is even more problematic when gender is added into the mix” (see Evans Cameron, “The Wrong Mistake” at pp 53.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Scenario 5 (Evidence):</strong> The claimant alleges he was tortured and raped by prison guards in his home country, after having been arrested for his political activities. He has submitted a psychological report by Dr. Sigmund Freud. Dr. Freud’s report recounts the fact that the claimant relayed to him. It then concludes that in his opinion, the claimant is suffering from post-traumatic stress syndrome and that his symptoms are consistent with the story recounted. The report also indicates that the claimant’s severe trauma made it difficult for him to recount the events he had experienced in a linear or consistent manner. Before the RPD, the claimant testified in ways that contradicted his Basis of Claim form in certain respects. His BOC said three guards were present during the rape, with two guards holding him down. At the hearing, however, he said that half-a-dozen guards were present. In his BOC, he said he was beaten with a cane every morning for a week. At the hearing, he said the beatings occurred only every other day, sometimes in the morning and sometimes in the afternoon. The RPD designated the claimant as a vulnerable person and allowed his counsel to take the lead in questioning him. <ul>
<li>RPD’s Finding: “Notwithstanding the claimant’s vulnerability and evident difficulty providing testimony, I am unable to find his allegations to be credible. Even keeping in mind the psychological report from Dr. Freud and the claimant’s evident difficulty providing testimony, the discrepancies in the claimant’s evidence are significant. I am unable to accept that the claimant would have trouble keeping track of whether three guards or six were present when he was raped. I am equally unable to accept that he would not be able to say whether he was beaten every day or every other day. It seems to me that each day’s respite would be something that would stick in his mind during such a harrowing experience.”</li>
<li>Suggested Response: This may be a case where the <strong>RPD has misunderstood or downplayed the psychological report admitted into evidence</strong> (see Evans Cameron, “The Wrong Mistake” at pp 45-46.) <strong>The RPD should have given more weight</strong> to Dr. Freud’s evidence and less weight to its own expectations about what a claimant might be able to recall. It is also arguable that the <strong>RPD failed to apply Guideline 8</strong> properly, in that the RPD failed to “[t]o <strong>recognize that certain individuals face particular difficulties when they appear for their hearings</strong> or other IRB processes because their ability to present their cases is severely impaired.” (Guideline 8, paragraph 3.1) </li>

<summary>From Theory to Practice: Trauma-Informed Interviewing</summary>
<ul>
<li>The author, Jill Taylor, lists five steps to ending the interview (See page 216). Test yourself. <ol>
<li><strong>Check in:</strong> Ask ask your client how they are feeling, and ask them how are they going to take care of themselves if the meeting was emotionally difficult or triggering.</li>
<li><strong>Ask for feedback:</strong> Ask your client what helped them during the interview process. Ask the what you could have done better.</li>
<li><strong>Provide resources if need be:</strong> Try to normalize the idea that everyone needs support.</li>
<li><strong>Provide contact information:</strong> Let them know how to reach you if they have questions, being clear about your availability and setting boundaries.</li>
<li><strong>Let them know what's next:</strong> Book the next appointment and let them know what to expect from you. </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>An <strong>Example</strong> Interview Closing<ul>
<li>Rebecca: Shreya, you have done an incredible job today. I know you spoke about some really traumatic things. I just want to make sure you’re going to be okay. What are your plans after this?</li>
<li>Shreya: I think I need a nap; I feel really exhausted. Afterwards, my boyfriend is coming over and we’re going to watch a movie.</li>
<li>Rebecca: That sounds nice! I’m glad you have someone supportive in your life. We’re going to end here for today. How did you find the interview went?
