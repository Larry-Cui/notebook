<summary>Introduction</summary>
<ul>
<li>One of three ways to become a protected person under the IRPA is to make a refugee protection <strong>claim in Canada</strong>. If found eligible, refugee protection claims are decided by the Immigration and Refugee Board (or IRB), more specifically the two divisions of the Board that deal with refugee matters - the <strong>Refugee Protection Division (or RPD)</strong> and the <strong>Refugee Appeal Division (or RAD)</strong>.</li>
<li>Time limit for appeal<ul>
<li>R159.91 (1) Subject to subsection (2), for the purpose of subsection 110(2.1) of the Act,<ul>
<li>(a) the time limit for a person or the Minister to file an appeal to the Refugee Appeal Division against a decision of the Refugee Protection Division is <strong>15 days</strong> after the day on which the person or the Minister <mark>receives</mark> written reasons for the decision; and</li>
<li>(b) the time limit for a person or the Minister to perfect such an appeal is <strong>30 days</strong> after the day on which the person or the Minister <mark>receives</mark> written reasons for the decision.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Extension: (2) If the appeal cannot be filed within the time limit set out in paragraph (1)(a) or perfected within the time limit set out in paragraph (1)(b), the <strong>Refugee Appeal Division may</strong>, for reasons of fairness and natural justice, <strong>extend each of those time limits by the number of days that is necessary in the circumstances</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>

<summary>Making a Refugee Protection Claim</summary>
<ul>
<li>A95 establishes a foundation for understanding the framework regarding claiming refugee protection in Canada.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/sc-2001-c-27/222404/sc-2001-c-27.html#275562" target="_blank">A95(1)</a> sets out <strong>three ways</strong> a person may apply for refugee protection.<ul>
<li><strong>Apply for a visa from abroad to be resettled</strong> to Canada as a Convention refugee or a person in similar circumstances. We will address resettlement as a refugee from abroad in Module 8.</li>
<li><strong>Making a claim</strong> for “refugee protection”, which will be processed by the <strong>Refugee Protection Division</strong>, or RPD, and possibly the <strong>Refugee Appeal Division</strong>, or RAD, of the IRB. Such claims will be the focus of this module.</li>
<li>Make a claim for “protection” by applying for a <strong>pre-removal risk assessment</strong>. Pre-removal risk assessments are dealt with in the course on Enforcement (ICL 870).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Sections 99 to 105 provide the framework for making claims that go to the IRB.<ul>
<li>These provisions first of all set out <strong>how and where</strong> to make a claim <a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/sc-2001-c-27/222404/sc-2001-c-27.html#275602" target="_blank">(section 99)</a>.</li>
<li>Second, they set out the process for assessing <strong>eligibility</strong> and the grounds for deeming a claim to be ineligible to go before the RPD <a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/sc-2001-c-27/222404/sc-2001-c-27.html#1173943" target="_blank">(sections 100-101)</a>.</li>
<li>Third, they set out the grounds for <strong>suspending or terminating proceedings</strong> before the RPD or the RAD <a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/laws/stat/sc-2001-c-27/222404/sc-2001-c-27.html#275665" target="_blank">(sections 103-105)</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>How and Where To Make a Claim (Section 99)</strong><ul>
<li>Claims made by a person in Canada may be made either:<ul>
<li>at a port-of-entry, such as an official border crossing or an airport;</li>
<li>within Canadian territory (“inside Canada other than at a port of entry”).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Can Canadian citizens make a claim for refugee protection?<ul>
<li>No. As confirmed by the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/refugee-protection/canada/claims-refugee-protection-intake.html" target="_blank">operational instructions</a>, Canadian citizens may not make a claim for refugee protection. However, claims may be made by both foreign nationals and permanent residents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Claims at <strong>Port of Entry</strong><ul>
<li>Claims at a port of entry are made to officers of the Canada Border Services Agency, or <strong>CBSA</strong></li>
<li>Claimants will be asked to fill out several forms, including the Generic Application Form for Canada (IMM 0008) and provide supporting documents (as described on the IRCC page, Applying for Refugee Protection from within Canada (IMM 5746))</li>
<li>The officer will seize claimants' passport and travel documents (providing claimants with true copies of genuine passports and travel documents)</li>
<li>The Claimant must submit the <strong>Basis of Claim (BOC)</strong> to the IRB within 15 days, in accordance with subsection 159.8(2) of the IRPR. It is possible to apply for an extension of time under subsection 159.8(3) of the IRPR and rule 8 of the RPD Rules.</li>
<li>Claimants will also be issued a <strong>conditional removal order</strong>, in most cases because they are considered to be in non-compliance with the IRPA (under section 41 of the IRPA). The removal order comes into force once the claim has been rejected, abandoned, or withdrawn.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Claims from <strong>inside Canada</strong><ul>
<li>Claims for refugee protection made inside Canada other than at a port of entry are made to officers of Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada, or <strong>IRCC</strong>.</li>
<li>Persons making claims to IRCC officers will have to submit the various application forms and the <strong>completed BOC</strong> to the IRCC officer when they make their application. They will also be interviewed and, in most cases, issued a <strong>conditional removal order</strong>.</li>
<li>The IRCC recently changed their <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/refugee-protection/canada/intake-procedures-inland-offices-regarding-claims-refugee-protection.html" target="_blank">inland claims process</a> and requires refugee claimants to initiate their claims through the online portal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Eligibility Determinations (Sections 100 and 101)</strong><ul>
<li>Once a person has made an application for refugee protection to a CBSA or an IRCC officer, either at a port of entry or inland, the officer will interview them to determine their <strong>eligibility</strong>.</li>
<li>The grounds for ineligibility are as follows:<ul>
<li>That refugee protection has been <strong>conferred</strong> on the claimant in Canada.</li>
<li>That a claim for refugee protection by the claimant has been <strong>rejected</strong> by the IRB.</li>
<li>That a prior claim by the claimant was determined to be <strong>ineligible</strong> to be referred to the RPD, or to have been <strong>withdrawn</strong> or <strong>abandoned</strong>.<ul>
<li>A withdrawal occurs when a claimant chooses not to pursue their claim and formally withdraws it.</li>
<li>An abandonment is a determination by the RPD or RAD that a claimant is in default in the proceedings, including by failing to appear. In other words, it is a deemed rejection in response to a lack of diligence.</li>
<li>Withdrawals and abandonments are governed by section 168 of the IRPA, rules 59 and 65 of the RPD rules, and rules 47 and 68 of the RAD Rules.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That the claimant has, before making a claim for refugee protection in Canada, made a <strong>claim for refugee protection to a country</strong> other than Canada, and the fact of its having been made has been confirmed under an information-sharing agreement with that other country.<ul>
<li>This ground of ineligibility was introduced in 2019. The countries with which Canada has an “information sharing” agreement are <strong>Australia, New Zealand, the United Kingdom, and the United States</strong>. <mark>Persons found ineligible on this ground may apply for a pre-removal risk assessment, with respect to which they are entitled to an oral hearing.</mark></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That the claimant has been <strong>recognized</strong> as a Convention refugee by a country other than Canada and can be sent or returned to that country.</li>
<li>That the claimant came directly or indirectly to Canada <strong>from a country designated by the regulations</strong>, other than a country of their nationality or their former habitual residence.<ul>
<li>This ground of ineligibility refers to the <strong>Safe Third Country Agreement (STCA)</strong> with the United States, which is the only country designated (under section 159.3 of the Regulations). The STCA is discussed by Desloges and Sawicki in section II.B of Chapter 13.</li>
<li>Note, however, that the <strong>constitutional challenge</strong> to the ongoing applicability of the STCA was successful before the Federal Court in Canadian Council for <em>Refugees v Canada (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship)</em>, <a href="https://canlii.ca/t/j8rd7" target="_blank">2020 FC 770</a>.  However, the Federal Court of Appeal overturned that decision <em>Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Canadian Council for Refugees</em>, <a href="https://canlii.ca/t/jfbm9" target="_blank">2021 FCA 72</a>.</li>
<li>That decision is currently under appeal. However, if the determination that paragraph 101(1)(e) of the IRPA and section 159.3 of the IRPR are unconstitutional is upheld on appeal, then paragraph 110(2)(d) would cease to have any application. Pending appeal, the STCA and its implementing provisions remain in force. Thus the fate of the STCA, its implementing provisions, and paragraph 110(2)(d) of the IRPA in particular, is uncertain at this time.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>That the claimant has been determined to be <strong>inadmissible</strong> on grounds of security, violating human or international rights, serious criminality or organized criminality, except for persons who are inadmissible solely on the grounds of paragraph 35(1)(c).</li>
<li>In addition to the listed grounds of ineligibility in section 101, subsection 99(3) provides that a claim for refugee protection <strong>may not be made by someone who is the subject of a removal order</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The officer will provide the claimant with a <strong>Confirmation of Referral form</strong>. For claims made at a port of entry, the Confirmation of Referral will also include the <strong>deadline for submitting the Basis of Claim (BOC)</strong> form - <strong>15 days</strong> after the claim is referred. For claims inland, the BOC must be submitted to an officer via the <strong>online portal</strong>.</li>
<li>Although rule 3 of the RPD Rules requires officers to fix the date, time and location of a hearing, that has not been the practice since 2018. Claims are heard on a first-in, first-out basis. <strong>The Notice to Appear with a hearing date for the claim is provided to claimants <mark>later</mark> by the IRB</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Suspension or Termination (sections 103 to 105 of the IRPA)</strong></li>

<li>As set out in <em>Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, <a href="https://canlii.ca/t/1fqlk" target="_blank">[1999] 2 SCR 817</a>, the requirements for procedural fairness before an administrative tribunal – like the RPD or RAD – are determined by examining the following non-exhaustive list of 5 factors:<ul>
<li>(1) the nature of the decision being made and process followed in making it;</li>
<li>(2) the nature of the statutory scheme and the terms of the statute pursuant to which the body operates;</li>
<li>(3) the importance of the decision to the individual or individuals affected;</li>
<li>(4) the legitimate expectations of the person challenging the decision;</li>
<li>(5) the choices of procedure made by the agency itself. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As we will see when reading <em>Thamotharem v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, <a href="https://canlii.ca/t/1rmr4" target="_blank">2007 FCA 198</a>, <strong>the procedural requirements before the RPD and RAD have generally be held to be high</strong>, in part because of the importance of the decision to refugee protection claimants.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>RPD and RAD: Inquisitorial, not Adversarial<ul>
<li>section 165 of the <em>IRPA</em> gives them the authority to summon witnesses and to require witnesses to give evidence, orally in or in writing, or to produce documents.</li>
<li>This provision confirms that proceedings before the RPD and RAD are meant to be <strong>inquisitorial</strong>, rather than <strong>adversarial</strong>. The member is to play an active role in questioning witnesses and determining how evidence is to be elicited during proceedings.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Proceedings<ul>
<li>in principle, proceedings must be held in public</li>
<li>but proceedings before the <strong>Refugee Protection Division</strong> and the <strong>Refugee Appeal Division</strong> must be held in the absence of the public;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The Right to Counsel &amp; Representation<ul>
<li>subsection 167(1) of the IRPA provides a right to be represented by counsel before the IRB. Subsection 167(2) of the IRPA provides a right to have the division <strong>designate a representative</strong> for persons who are under 18 years of age or who are “unable to appreciate the nature of the proceedings.”</li>
<li>RPD rule 20 provides the duties of a designated representative include deciding whether to retain counsel, making decisions regarding the claim, assisting in gathering evidence, and filing an appeal with the RAD, if necessary.</li>
<li>RAD rule 23 includes many of the same requirements. The rule also states that if someone has been a designated representative for a claimant before the RPD, they are deemed to have been designated as a representative by the RAD on appeal.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Abandonment &amp; Withdrawals<ul>
<li>Section 168 is very important, as it governs abandonments and withdrawals.</li>
<li>RPD Rule 65 provides that before a claim can be declared abandoned, the Division must give the claimant the <strong>opportunity to explain why it should not be</strong>.</li>
<li>RAD Rule 68 is similar, although it only applies if a hearing has been scheduled.</li>
<li>It is very important to <strong>avoid abandonment</strong>. If a claim or appeal has been declared abandoned, under RPD Rule 62 or RAD rule 49, it may only be reopened if there was a failure of natural justice.</li>
</ul>

<summary>The Refugee Protection Division</summary>
<ul>
<li><strong>Section 96</strong> reproduces in its essentials the refugee definition from the 1951 Convention relating to the Status of Refugees. Persons falling within section 96 are referred to as “<strong>Convention refugees</strong>” in the IRPA.</li>
<li>Persons falling under <strong>section 97</strong> are referred to as “persons in need of protection” in the IRPA.<ul>
<li>Note that “<strong>persons in need of protection</strong>” as defined in section 97 are distinct from “<strong>protected persons</strong>” who receive refugee protection under section 95. Being a person in need of protection is one ground for receiving refugee protection, hence for becoming a protected person. Not all protected persons, however, are persons in need of protection. Some of them may simply be Convention refugees.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Persons falling under <strong>section 98</strong> are expressly <strong>excluded</strong> from the definitions in sections 96 and 97 and hence cannot receive refugee protection.</li>
<li>subsection <strong>107(1)</strong> states that the RPD shall accept a claim for refugee protection if the claimant is either a Convention refugee (i.e., if they fall within section 96) or a person in need of protection (i.e., if they fall within section 97). Otherwise, the RPD shall reject the claim.<ul>
<li>First, it uses the mandatory “shall”, rather than the discretionary “may.” Second, no other criteria are mentioned other than those found in sections 96 and 97.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Subsection <strong>107(2)</strong> requires the RPD, if it is of the opinion that there was no credible or trustworthy evidence on which it could have made a favourable decision, to state that there is “<strong>no credible basis</strong>” for the claim. The leading case on “no credible basis” statements is <em>Rahaman v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, <a href="http://canlii.ca/t/4jbr" target="_blank">2002 FCA 89</a>.</li>
<li>Section <strong>107.1</strong> states that if the RPD, in rejecting a claim, is of the opinion that a claim is clearly fraudulent, it must state in its decision that the claim was “<strong>manifestly unfounded</strong>”. To make such a declaration, the RPD member must have <strong>a firm conviction</strong> that refugee protection is sought through fraudulent means that go to the core of the claim (see <em>He v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, <a href="http://canlii.ca/t/hwr4l" target="_blank">2019 FC 2</a> at paragraph 21; <em>Warsame v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, <a href="http://canlii.ca/t/gscvk" target="_blank">2016 FC 596</a> at paragraphs 31 and 36).</li>
<li>Under paragraph <strong>110(2)(c)</strong> of the IRPA, if the RPD makes a declaration that a claim has <strong>no credible basis</strong> or is <strong>manifestly unfounded</strong>, then the decision may <strong>not be appealed to the RAD</strong>.</li>
<li>paragraphs 170(b) and 170(f) provide that in most cases the RPD <strong>must hold a hearing</strong> and give notice of the hearing to the claimant and the Minister. However, the RPD may decide <strong>not to hold a hearing if a claim is allowed</strong>, and the Minister has not given notice of an intention to intervene.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details class="note">
<summary>The Refugee Appeal Division</summary>
<ul>
<li>The provisions governing the RAD are found in <strong>sections 110-111 and 171-171.1</strong> of the IRPA.</li>
<li>The RAD has been designed to be a primarily <strong>paper-based appeal</strong> of the RPD’s decision, with very limited powers to either receive new evidence or to hold oral hearings. It reviews RPD decisions on a <strong>correctness</strong> standard (see <em>Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Huruglica</em>, <a href="http://canlii.ca/t/gp2gp" target="_blank">2016 FCA 93</a>)</li>
<li>Seven Grounds For <strong>Denying a Right of Appeal</strong><ul>
<li><strong>Designated Foreign Nationals:</strong> paragraph 110(2)(a) of the IRPA, an RPD decision concerning a “designated foreign national” may not be appealed. This is a reference to section 20.1 of the IRPA, which empowers the Minister of Public Safety and Emergency Preparedness to designate certain groups arriving in Canada as “irregular arrivals.” Foreign national belonging to a group whose arrival was designated irregular are deemed “designated foreign nationals.” the government has used this designation power in only a very small number of cases, and not at all since the first weeks immediately after section 20.1 came into force in December 2012.</li>
<li><mark><strong>Withdrawn or Abandoned Claims:</strong></mark> paragraph <strong>110(2)(b)</strong> of the IRPA, there is no appeal from a decision by the RPD that a claim has been withdrawn or abandoned, in accordance with section 168 of the IRPA. The only recourse for a person whose claim has been determined to be withdrawn or abandoned by the RPD is to seek to <strong>reinstate</strong> (in the case of a withdrawal) or <strong>reopen</strong> (in the case of an abandonment) the claim before the RPD (Rules 60 and 62 of the RPD Rules govern reinstatements and reopenings, respectively).</li>
<li><mark><strong>No Credible Basis:</strong></mark> under paragraph 110(2)(c) of the IRPA, there is no appeal from a decision by the RPD rejecting a claim that states that the claim has <strong>no credible basis</strong> or is <strong>manifestly unfounded</strong>, in accordance with subsection 107(2) and section 107.1.</li>
<li><strong>Safe Third Country Agreement:</strong> under paragraph 110(2)(d) of the IRPA, there is no right of appeal for foreign nationals who were able to come to Canada and claim refugee protection from the United States under an exemption to the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/mandate/policies-operational-instructions-agreements/agreements/safe-third-country-agreement/final-text.html" target="_blank">Safe Third Country Agreement, or STCA</a>.<ul>
<li>The provisions implementing the STCA – paragraph <strong>101(1)(e)</strong> of the IRPA and section 159.3 of the IRPR, designating the United States – were successfully challenged under the Charter in <em>Canadian Council for Refugees v. Canada (Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship)</em>, <a href="http://canlii.ca/t/j8rd7" target="_blank">2020 FC 770</a>. However, the Federal Court of Appeal overturned that decision <em>Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v. Canadian Council for Refugees</em>, <a href="https://canlii.ca/t/jfbm9" target="_blank">2021 FCA 72</a>.</li>
<li>if the determination that paragraph <strong>101(1)(e)</strong> of the IRPA and section 159.3 of the IRPR are unconstitutional is upheld on appeal, then paragraph <strong>110(2)(d)</strong> would cease to have any application.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Designated Countries of Origin:</strong> Paragraph <strong>110(2)(d.1)</strong> denied appeals from a decision concerning foreign nationals who were citizens of countries designated under section 109.1 of the IRPA. However, paragraph 110(2)(d.1) was declared unconstitutionally discriminatory under section 15 of the Charter in <em>Y.Z. v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, <a href="http://canlii.ca/t/gkcps" target="_blank">2015 FC 892</a>. The <em>Y.Z.</em> decision was not appealed. Therefore, <strong>paragraph 110(2)(d.1) is of no force or effect</strong>.</li>
<li><mark><strong>Cessation:</strong></mark> <strong>110(2)(e)</strong> a decision of the Refugee Protection Division allowing or rejecting an application by the Minister for a determination that refugee protection has ceased;</li>
<li><mark><strong>Vacation of Refugee Protection:</strong></mark> paragraph <strong>110(2)(f)</strong> of the IRPA bars appeals from decisions of the RPD allowing or rejecting an application under section 109 by the Minister to vacate a decision to allow a claim for refugee protection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Under rule 3 of the <strong>RAD Rules</strong>, a <strong>perfected record</strong> must include:<ul>
<li>The notice of decision and written reasons of the RPD.</li>
<li>All or part of the transcript of the RPD decision, if the appellant wants to use it in the appeal.</li>
<li>Any documents that the RPD refused to accept as evidence if you want to use those documents in support of your appeal.</li>
<li>A written statement that states whether you are submitting new evidence that that was not submitted to the RPD and whether you are requesting an oral hearing on the basis of that evidence.</li>
<li>Legal authorities that support your arguments on appeal.</li>
<li>A memorandum of argument.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>subsection 110(4): On appeal, the person who is the subject of the appeal may present only <strong>evidence that arose after the rejection of their claim or that was not reasonably available</strong>, or that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection.</li>
<li>The Court of Appeal In <em>Canada (Citizenship and Immigration) v Singh</em>, <a href="http://canlii.ca/t/gp31b" target="_blank">2016 FCA 96</a> at paragraph 34 stated that subsection 110(4) only allows for the submission of evidence<ul>
<li>that arose after the rejection of the claim;</li>
<li>that was not reasonably available; or</li>
<li>that was reasonably available, but that the person could not reasonably have been expected in the circumstances to have presented, at the time of the rejection.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>subsection 110(5) states that the restrictions on new evidence in subsection 110(4) do not apply when a claimant is responding to evidence submitted by the Minister.</li>
<li>Subsection 110(6) of the IRPA significantly limits the availability of oral hearings at the RAD. the RAD may only hold <strong>oral hearings to resolve determinative issues of credibility arising out of evidence</strong> that was not part of the RPD record. Even when there is new evidence that meets those criteria, the power to hold a hearing or not is still discretionary (on this point, see <em>Oluwakemi v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, <a href="http://canlii.ca/t/gtzw0" target="_blank">2016 FC 973</a> at paragraph 7).</li>
<li>Referrals:<ul>
<li>A111(2) The Refugee Appeal Division may make the referral described in paragraph (1)(c) only if it is of the opinion that<ul>
<li>(a) the decision of the Refugee Protection Division is wrong in law, in fact or in mixed law and fact; and</li>
<li>(b) it <strong>cannot make a decision</strong> under paragraph 111(1)(a) or (b) <strong>without hearing evidence</strong> that was presented to the Refugee Protection Division.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In <em>Huruglica v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, <a href="https://canlii.ca/t/gp2gp" target="_blank">2016 FCA 93</a> at para 70, the Federal Court of Appeal said that the power to send a case back to the RPD applied to cases where the RPD enjoys a “meaningful advantage” over the RAD.</li>

<p>In <em>Canadian Association of Refugee Lawyers v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, 2020 FCA 196, the Federal Court of Appeal held that the statement that RPD and RAD members are “expected” to apply jurisprudential guides in similar cases or explain why not <strong>unlawfully fettered members’ discretion</strong>. </p>

<p>In <em>Thamotharem v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, 2007 FCA 198, the Federal Court of Appeal held that although having the RPD member question the claimant first is unfair, it does not amount to breach procedural fairness where the claim is manifestly unfounded.</p>

<p>The Federal Court of Appeal held that while a claimant may derive tactical advantage from being taken through their claim first by their own counsel, the loss of that advantage does not necessarily lead to unfairness. Indeed, having the RPD member question a claimant first in one sense increases the level of fairness, in that it provides notice to the claimant and their counsel as to which areas of the claim most concern the member.</p>
