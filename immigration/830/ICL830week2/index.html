<summary>Module 2 - Study Permits</summary>
<ul>
<li>Study permits are needed for courses that are <strong>longer than six months</strong>.</li>
<li>The two most important parts of the study permit application package are the <strong>study plan</strong> and <strong>financial documentation</strong>.</li>
<li>Depending on whether your client is a visa-requiring or visa-exempt national, after <strong>applying online</strong>, they will be issued either a <strong>student visa</strong> or an <strong>eTA</strong> along with the letter/email approving their study permit application. The study permit will be <strong>issued</strong> at the POE.</li>
<li>Who can apply for the study permit at the POE: <strong>US national</strong>, <strong>US PR</strong>, <strong>residents of Greenland and St Pierre and Miquelon</strong>. (R214)</li>
<li>There is a different between a learning institution qualifying for a client to obtain a <strong>study permit</strong> and for a student to be eligible to apply for a <strong>post-graduation work permit (PGWP)</strong>.</li>
<li>If foreign-national (FN) parents are in Canada as students or workers, their minor children who want to attend primary or secondary school do not need to apply for a study permit. In such cases, the minor would apply for a visitor record.</li>
<li>Regardless of the <a href="https://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/fc-cf/decisions/en/item/40314/index.do" target="_blank">De Brito</a> decision, the authorization to work and study without a permit under paragraph R186(u) or section R189 while pending a decision on an application <strong>ends on departure</strong> from Canada. If the new study or work permit has not been issued prior to the applicant’s return, they may <strong>not resume work or study</strong> in Canada until their application for renewal has been granted. Official link: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/temporary-residents/visitors/implied-status-extending-stay.html" target="_blank">here</a>.</li>
<li>If a student would like to change schools at the post-secondary level, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/change-schools.html" target="_blank">IRCC policy</a> states that they may do so as long as the new school is a DLI and the student <strong>advises IRCC of the change</strong>.</li>
<li>A study permit allows a foreign national to work up to <strong>20 hours a week during regular academic sessions</strong> and <strong>full time during scheduled breaks</strong> without a work permit. An international student will need to obtain a <strong>social insurance number</strong> from Service Canada to be allowed to work in Canada.</li>
<li>There are a few cases where you may be able to take a leave of up to a maximum of <strong>150 days</strong> from your program of studies and still be considered to be actively pursuing your studies. See <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/study-permit/while-you-study/study-permit-conditions.html" target="_blank">IRCC link</a>.<ul>
<li><strong>You can’t work on or off campus during an authorized leave from your study program, even if your study permit says you’re allowed to work in Canada.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A student must apply for the PGWP within 180 days of graduation. The <strong>calculation of the 180 days</strong> begins the day the <strong>final transcript is issued</strong>, or the day formal <strong>written notice</strong> of confirmation from the institution is obtained.</li>
<li>PGWP is issued based on the program of study. If the foreign national accelerated their studies, they would still be eligible for an PGWP corresponding to the length the program, not the actual study period.</li>
<li>Programs that are part of a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/study-canada/work/after-graduation/eligibility.html#curriculum" target="_blank">curriculum licensing arrangement</a>, are offered by private career colleges on behalf of public, PGWP-eligible institutions. Starting <strong>May 15, 2024</strong>, graduates of curriculum licensing programs will <strong>no longer be eligible</strong> for PGWP.</li>
<li>Amendments obliged students both to remain <strong>enrolled</strong> in that institution and to "<strong>actively pursue</strong> their course or program of study" (<em>IRPR</em>, <strong>s 22.1(1)</strong>).</li>
<li>Students will be deemed to have "<strong>maintained status</strong>" while waiting for the decision on their new application (<em>IRPR</em>, ss 183(5), 186 (w), 189). Processing times for study permit extensions can be lengthy (often more than three months).</li>
<li>Maintained status will end when Immigration Refugees and Citizenship Canada (IRCC) decides the extension application. If the extension is refused, the client will have the option of applying for restoration. <strong>A restoration application must be made within 90 days of the refusal letter or the expiration of the study permit.</strong> Source: Under <strong>s 47</strong> of the <em>IRPA</em>, status is lost on expiry of the period of authorized stay <strong>or</strong> on determination by an officer that the foreign national has failed to comply with any other requirement of the <em>IRPA</em>.</li>
<li>Students who did not want to wait for the decision on a new application may have opted to "<strong>flagpole</strong>", the practice of going to the United States and returning immediately or after a short stay to apply for an extension of the period of stay. Foreign nationals, do not need a visa to do so if their initial period of authorized stay has not expired (<em>IRPR</em>, <strong>s 190(3)(f)</strong>).</li>
<li>For either a study permit extension or restoration application, you still need to submit:<ul>
<li>education enrolment documents</li>
<li>proof of financial support</li>
<li>valid passport</li>
<li>proof of academic standing at the learning institution for the last two periods of study</li>
<li>applicable IRCC completed application forms</li>
<li>appropriate fee payment receipts: <strong>for restoration applications it is important to pay the additional $229.00 restoration application fee, as well as the $150 study permit fee</strong></li>
<li>in most situations, a client will not need a new medical exam, unless they are working with children or in the health services</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If the applicant requires an extension or has lost status, the accompanying family members would <strong>also require extension or restoration</strong> applications. Each accompanying family member would need to submit their own application for extension or restoration of their temporary resident status.</li>
<li>If your client <strong>leaves Canada</strong> while their extension application is being processed, they do <strong>not benefit</strong> from maintained status.</li>
<li>Clients are only permitted to apply for restoration if they are <strong>in Canada</strong>. If they <strong>leave Canada</strong> after applying for restoration, they <strong>cannot have their status restored</strong>.</li>

<p>Chantal is worried she may have to stop working on campus because she failed a course and is considering changing schools. She has not yet stopped studying and her professor is willing to allow her to take the exam again and state that a failed course doesn't mean she is considered part time. What conditions can impact her ability to work on campus? Pick the most complete answer.</p>

<p>Ivy has a short-term study permit that allows her to attend an ESL course that is eight months in duration. She wants to work part time, off campus and is sure she can do so because her friend Rupali said it was okay. Rupali has a two-year study permit, is attending a full-time course of study and she is allowed to work off campus. Do you concur with Rupali?</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Yes, because Ivy study permit is more than six months just like Rupali.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> No, because Ivy does not have valid job offer.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" checked/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> No, because Ivy is <strong>enrolled in an ESL course</strong> which does not permit off campus employment without a work permit.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Yes, because Ivy has a valid study permit just like Rupali.<blockquote>
