<summary>LMIA and LMIA-based WP</summary>
<ul>
<li>Joint Service Agreements:<ul>
<li>LMIA-based work permits may involve you <strong>representing the employer and foreign national</strong>. You should have the appropriate agreements in place to ensure that all parties are aware of the nature of the relationship.</li>
<li>You should be aware of who is required to pay for what applications. For example, the <strong>employer</strong> must <strong>pay for the LMIA application</strong> and they <strong>cannot recoup this cost</strong> from the foreign national, whereas the <strong>employer or foreign national can pay for the work permit application</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>As of November 16th, 2022, the NOC system made the switch from the previous NOC 2016 to the new current NOC 2021. Among other changes, the NOC 2021 system switched from skill type to TEER categories. <a href="https://www.statcan.gc.ca/en/subjects/standard/noc/2021/introductionV1" target="_blank">Online</a></li>

<li>After you've collected all the facts, you'll need to start planning your strategy:<ul>
<li>Consider <strong>alternatives</strong> to LMIA (WP exemptions, LMIA exemptions)</li>
<li>If LMIA is the best option, explain two-step process (LMIA then WP) and consider:​<ul>
<li>Employer’s ability to qualify for LMIA ​</li>
<li>Employee’s ability to qualify for WP​</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Consider different LMIA <strong>streams</strong> and options for expedited processing​</li>
<li>Discuss <strong>compliance</strong> (1 in 4 employers will be inspected)</li>

<details class="note">
<summary>Employer Compliance</summary>
<ul>
<li>Compliance is an important aspect of the Temporary Foreign Worker (TFW) program and the International Mobility Program (IMP), which is covered in Modules 4 and 5. The purpose is twofold:<ul>
<li>to <strong>protect</strong> the integrity of the Canadian <strong>labour market</strong> by reviewing and encouraging the appropriate use of the programs; and</li>
<li>to <strong>protect</strong> temporary <strong>foreign workers</strong> from being exploited by employers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For the Temporary Foreign Worker program, the employer must adhere to the conditions outlined in the LMIA application. <strong>The employer must:</strong><ul>
<li>comply with the conditions and time limits in each temporary worker’s work permit, for which the employer is legally responsible</li>
<li>employ the foreign worker on substantially the same terms and conditions, including wage, work hours, job duties and work location, as those set out in the LMIA<ul>
<li>Once the foreign worker no longer works for the employer (either because the foreign worker has been terminated or their work permit expires) or if the foreign worker becomes a permanent resident, the employer is <strong>no longer required</strong> to adhere to the conditions</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>remain <strong>actively engaged</strong> in the business that submitted the offer of employment for as long as the temporary worker is employed</li>
<li>review and adjust the foreign worker’s wages, at least annually, to ensure that the foreign worker <strong>continues to receive the prevailing wage</strong> for the occupation and region of employment (Wages, however, should not be substantially changed without prior authorization from Service Canada)</li>
<li>retain employment records for a period of <strong>six years</strong> after the foreign worker commences employment, regardless of whether the foreign worker continues to be employed by the employer</li>
<li>cooperate with Service Canada in the event of inspection (which can be conducted by correspondence or on-site) to verify the employer’s compliance with the Temporary Foreign Worker program<ul>
<li>Inspections may include verification of documents, worksite visits and/or interviews with foreign worker(s)</li>
<li>If an employer is found non-compliant, a range of consequences can be imposed, including warnings, monetary penalties and bans from the Temporary Foreign Worker program (Inspections are discussed in detail in the assigned readings for Module 3)</li>
<li>Representatives should recommend to their employer clients to obtain legal advice if they are selected for an inspection</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>establish administrative systems allowing them to separately monitor and track the foreign workers they employ; the foreign workers’ duties and terms of employment must always correspond with the commitments made in the LMIA application and the specific terms noted on each foreign worker’s work permit</li>
<li>pay the foreign workers by cheque or direct deposit and provide a pay stub indicating the deductions from the gross salary remitted to Canada Revenue Agency</li>
<li>keep all payroll records, time sheets, tax forms, receipts and documents related to any benefits, reimbursement of transportation costs, health insurance and/or workplace safety paid on behalf of the foreign workers, for a period of six years after the first date of foreign worker’s employment after obtaining the work permit</li>
<li>obtain advice before making any changes to the foreign workers’ terms and conditions of employment, as implementation of such changes may first require the filing of a <strong>new LMIA</strong> and obtaining a new work permit</li>
<li><strong>Voluntary disclosure</strong>: <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/employment-social-development/services/foreign-workers/voluntary-disclosure.html" target="_blank">online</a></li>

She advertised for the position on the Job Bank, Vancouver Star, indeed.ca and in Canadian teacher's publications.  The wages being offered are just under $100,000 per year. The hiring of the new Principal means that the school will be able to operate and retain 5 Canadian teachers and enrollment of 65 Canadian /permanent resident students. The job is genuine in nature and Charmaine advises that those who have applied are not qualified for the position, and as such a labour shortage is being filled.

<p>Robinson Farms in PEI have recently expanded operations and have acquired an additional 1000-acres of forest where maple syrup is harvested. As well they have acquired several mink farms. The farm workers on staff do not have the experience nor knowledge in maple syrup harvesting nor that in raising or dealing with mink. Lori Robinson, farm manager, has business dealings with Alex Trkulja from Latvia who specializes in both mink production and maple syrup production. He has offered to send some of his experienced workers in exchange for a share of the profit from the crops. Lori is intrigued but knows that she first must ensure that there are no qualified Canadians/PRs who can do the job but is making inquiries on how she might be able to bring these workers. **What might be the best way to bring these workers and why? **</p>
