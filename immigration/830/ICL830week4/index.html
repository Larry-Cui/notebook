<ul>
<li>IMP is not based on employer demand or a skills shortage but largely on multilateral/bilateral agreements with other countries. <strong>No LMIA is required</strong> and the program is based largely on reciprocity. Workers in this category are able to get <strong>open work permits</strong>, making participants in this program more mobile. Persons in this category are considered <strong>highly skilled</strong> and work in <strong>high-wage</strong> jobs.</li>
<li>the LMIA-exempt process also involves two steps. The first step is completed by the employer and the second step is the employee’s work permit application. The first step in the LMIA-exempt process, which the employer completes, is much <strong>quicker</strong>. No advertising or recruitment efforts are required. Instead, the employer submits an offer of employment through their <strong>employer portal account</strong> in the IRCC system. The online portal will then generate <strong>a number</strong> that the employee needs to use in their work permit application.</li>
<li><strong>A joint service agreement:</strong> may be required if you are representing the employer and the foreign national. The employer must pay for the <strong>employer compliance fee</strong>, whereas the employer or foreign national can pay for the <strong>work permit application</strong>.</li>

<li>On December 15, 2022, there were several code changes and new codes added to the list of LMIA exemptions.  Student should ensure that they are using the <strong>correct coding</strong> based on the specific work permit category instructions, and be aware for cases that might arise where both old and new codes have been involved.</li>
<li>Whether a foreign national qualifies for an LMIA-exempt work permit is contingent on the <strong>type of work</strong> or activity that will be performed in Canada, the <strong>foreign national's qualifications</strong>, and/or <strong>country of citizenship</strong>.</li>

<p>Dr. Sanchez brought Carlos, an Accountant to work for his dental clinics under the Canada–Panama Free Trade Agreement (CPFTA). He offered Carlos a $65,000.00 a year salary. Carlos worked for a few months, did not like the job, and left his employment. Dr. Sanchez made an application for another foreign worker and had to prove compliance with his previous employee. Through discussions with Dr. Sanchez, you come to discover that Dr. Sanchez paid Carlos $20,000.00 less than what he had promised. Dr. Sanchez argued that he had fixed Carlos's teeth and as part of payment of that service, he had deducted it from his wages. Is there a chance that Dr. Sanchez may <strong>NOT</strong> be allowed to hire the new accountant and be <strong>barred</strong> from hiring a foreign worker for two years? Select the best possible reason:</p>

<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> No, because despite breaching the terms and conditions of his employment, Carlos quitting only after a few months of working for Dr. Sanchez was beyond Dr. Sanchez's control.</li>

<p>Thomas, a Canadian citizen, applied to sponsor his spouse one year ago. There was an unfortunate delay in the application’s processing. In fact, the visa post closed down and the application had to be transferred. The couple hasn’t been together for some time now and Thomas would like his spouse to come to Canada on a Temporary Resident Visa (TRV) for the winter holiday. His spouse just lost her job in her home country, and he would like to be with her to support her. He is worried that his spouse’s application for Permanent Residence which is still in progress, might cause the refusal of the Temporary Resident Visa (TRV). Which of the following is most likely the reason the spouse’s TRV could be refused?</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Because a foreign national is not allowed to have two applications in progress at the same time.</li>

<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" checked/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Because the spouse might not leave Canada if her Permanent Residence application is refused.<blockquote>
<p>Pursuant to s. 22(2) of the IRPA, Thomas' spouse has "<strong>dual intent</strong>." While it may be a challenge in a spousal sponsorship application, <strong>Thomas can address his wife's dual intention by informing the officer</strong> that she will abide by the rules as a temporary resident (if approved) and that should her PR application be refused, she would be compelled to return to her home country since she has no other significant ties to Canada other than him.</p>

<p>Oliver is on a study permit in Canada. He is in his third year of an engineering program at the University in Toronto. In Feb 2024, he became severely depressed and stopped attending classes and all his classes were deemed incomplete for that term. Oliver discussed his health situation with the school and obtained a granted leave of three months. Oliver didn’t notify the IRCC about the three-month break though. After receiving medical treatment and taking time to rest, he went back to school to continue his program as a full-time student in September 2024. His study permit is valid for another year.
