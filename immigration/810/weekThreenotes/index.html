<details class="note">
<summary>3.1 Introduction to Administrative Law</summary>
<ul>
<li>Three areas of public law: constitutional law, criminal law and administrative law</li>
<li>Administrative law ensures that:<ul>
<li>government actions are <strong>authorized</strong> by Parliament (or provincial legislatures)</li>
<li>laws are implemented in a <strong>fair and reasonable</strong> ( and sometimes, correct) manner</li>
<li>government decisions must be <strong>legal</strong> and individuals must have <strong>remedies</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Besides immigration and citizenship law, administrative law also engaged in<ul>
<li>Human rights</li>
<li>Extradition</li>
<li>Regulation of professions</li>
<li>others</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Jurisdiction</strong>: the scope of the authority or powers conferred on a government body or official by legislation or by common law</li>
<li><strong>Discretion</strong>: the power of a government official or agency to decide a course of action from among a variety of options available under the law</li>
<li><strong>Procedural fairness</strong>: a decision-maker acting under a statutory power of decision must give any person whose rights, privileges or interests are affected by a decision reasonable notice of the case they have to meet and an opportunity to respond; and must be impartial.</li>
<li><strong>Rule against sub-delegation</strong>: the principle that the particular person to whom a power or authority has been delegated may not re-delegate that power to someone else unless clearly authorized to do so by law.</li>
<li><strong>Subordinate legislation</strong>: legislation made by a body other than Parliament or a provincial legislature (such as Cabinet, a Cabinet minister, an agency or a municipal council), as authorized by statute; generally includes regulations, proclamations, rules, orders, ministerial instructions or other instruments; also called “delegated legislation”; distinguished from statutes (or “acts”).</li>
<li><strong>Judicial review</strong>: the exercise by a superior or other court granted authority by statute of its supervisory authority over ministries and other government agencies by reviewing whether they have carried out their functions in accordance with the principles of administrative law. <em>The Federal Court of Canada is the court of first instance for judicial review of immigration and citizenship matters</em>.</li>
<li>Courts should <strong>defer to</strong> decisions made by administrators</li>
<li>Governments may take actions that limit activities of citizens or their access to rights/benefits <strong>only in accordance with substantive and procedural requirements prescribed by law</strong></li>
<li>The <strong>rule of law</strong> means government actors and decision -makers have powers/duties <strong>limited by law</strong> and must follow procedures set out in legislation when exercising them</li>
<li><em>Roncarelli v Duplessis</em>, 1959 CanLII 50 (SCC), Headnote:<ul>
<li>the cancellation of the permit was the result of an order given by the defendant to the manager of the Commission.</li>
<li>There was no authority enabling the defendant to direct the cancellation of a permit. The intent and purpose of that Act placed complete control over the liquor traffic in the hands of an independent commission.</li>
<li>Cancellation of a permit by the Commission, at the request or upon the direction of a third party, as was done in this case, was not a proper and valid exercise of the powers.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details class="note">
<summary>3.2 Fairness and the Right to be Heard</summary>
<ul>
<li>Procedural fairness has two main components: the right to be heard, the right to an impartial decision.</li>
<li><em>Nicholson v Haldimand-Norfolk Regional Police Commissioners</em>, 1978 CanLII 24 (SCC): The appellant should have been told why his services were no longer required and given an opportunity to respond. While the appellant could not claim the procedural protections of a constable with more than eighteen month’s service, he should have been treated ‘fairly’ not arbitrarily.</li>
<li>Following <em>Nicholson</em>, Canadian procedural fairness case law was marked by the gradual expansion of <mark>the duty of fairness to all areas</mark> of administrative decision making affecting an individual’s rights, privileges and interests.</li>
<li><em>Baker v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, 1999 CanLII 699 (SCC): <strong>legitimate expectation?</strong> Pass. <strong>explanation for a decision?</strong> Pass. <strong>Reasonable apprehension of bias?</strong> Fail, the immigration officer’s notes gave the impression that he may have been drawing conclusions based not on the evidence before him, but on the fact that the appellant was a single mother with several children and had been diagnosed with a psychiatric illness.</li>
<li><em>Baker</em> is described as the "<strong>most significant administrative law judgments ever delivered by the Supreme Court of Canada” because of its comprehensive discussion of administrative law principles</strong>".</li>
<li>5 factors to determine the degree of procedural fairness ("Baker Factors"):<ul>
<li>Nature of the decision and process followed in making it: decisions that more closely resemble judicial decisions will more likely to require procedural protections akin to a trial</li>
<li>Nature of the statutory scheme: where there is no appeal procedure, procedural protections will be greater</li>
<li>Importance of the decision to person affected: decisions with significant consequences will require more procedural protections</li>
<li>Legitimate expectations of the parties: where a clear representation or promise as to the procedure to be followed is provided by the decision-maker, it is unfair to act contrary to that promise</li>
<li>The procedures chosen by the tribunal or decision-makers themselves: courts give weight to these choices</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Not every administrative law decision will attract the duty to give reasons. Also, the duty to give reasons will vary according to the type of decision. However, the absence of reasons when circumstances dictate they are required, may serve as a basis for review under the duty of fairness</li>
<li>Sources of Procedural Fairness:<ul>
<li>The <em>Citizenship Act</em>: prescribes application procedures in Part V of the Act while Part II of the Act prescribes fairly elaborate procedures for citizenship revocation.</li>
<li>The <em>IRPA</em>:<ul>
<li>largely silent as to the procedures to be followed for most immigration matters.</li>
<li>An important exception concerns the IRB.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the <em>Immigration and Refugee Protection Regulations</em> (IRPR) and the <em>Citizenship Regulations</em> do not include detailed procedural rules. However, the IRPR does impose some broad procedural parameters, including the default written nature of the hearing, and the right to representation.</li>
<li>policy instruments, including guidelines, program delivery instructions, operational manuals and operational bulletins, tend to be the <mark>most important source</mark> of procedural entitlements, generating the right under the <mark>legitimate expectations</mark> doctrine.<ul>
<li>An important policy instrument in relation to all types of immigration and citizenship decision-making - outside the IRB context - is IRCC's <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/procedural-fairness.html" target="_blank">operational instructions on procedural fairness</a>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The common law or judge-made principles are another important source of procedural rights.</li>
<li>The <em>Constitution</em> and the <em>Charter</em>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>One important exception to the right to be heard: administrative decisions of a legislative nature may <mark>not</mark> engage any entitlement to procedural fairness. In <em>Canadian Doctors for Refugee Care v Canada (Attorney General)</em>, 2014 FC 651, the Court provided that legislature did not give rise to participatory rights for the potentially infinite group of stakeholders.</li>
<li>Immigration decision makers disclose the information they rely upon in coming to a decision: the more significant the <strong>interests</strong> at stake, the more substantial the likely <strong>impact</strong> on these interests, and the more <strong>adjudicative</strong> (rather than regulatory or policy-driven) the proceeding, the greater the extent of disclosure.</li>
<li><a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/procedural-fairness.html" target="_blank">IRCC's operational instructions on procedural fairness</a>:<ul>
<li>processing without undue delay</li>
<li>fair and impartial decision-making</li>
<li>right to be heard</li>
<li>whoever hears must decide</li>
<li>legitimate expectation</li>
<li>decisions based on IRPA and IRPR</li>
<li>reasons of a decision</li>
</ul>

<summary>3.3 Fairness and Impartiality</summary>
<ul>
<li>Test for Reasonable Apprehension of Bias (<strong>RAB</strong>): [T]he apprehension of bias must be a reasonable one, held by reasonable and right minded persons, applying themselves to the question and obtaining thereon the required information. That test is ‘what would an informed person, viewing the matter realistically and practically – and having thought the matter through – conclude.</li>
<li>threshold for establishing RAB: the threshold for establishing such a claim is <strong>high</strong>, and whether a reasonable apprehension of bias arises will depend entirely upon the <strong>facts of the case</strong>.</li>
<li>4 indicators of possible bias:<ul>
<li>conflict of interest</li>
<li>Personal relationships</li>
<li>Prior knowledge of facts (that are prejudicial to one of the parties)</li>
<li>A predisposition toward an outcome</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Government officials are generally <strong>free</strong> to consult with other staff members when making decisions and are generally not required to notify the parties that have done so.</li>
<li>An adjudicator can seek advice, including talking things over with other adjudicators or seeking advice from their agency’s legal counsel about risk, as long as:<ul>
<li>They make the final <strong>decision</strong>,</li>
<li>The consultation is <strong>voluntary</strong>,</li>
<li>No one puts <strong>pressure</strong> on the adjudicator to make a certain decision, and</li>
<li>No new issues or facts are <strong>introduced</strong> without parties being notified and permitted to comment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>At the first available opportunity: raise an allegation of RAB as early as possible</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details class="note">
<summary>3.4: Judicial Review</summary>
<ul>
<li>Achieving a high-level understanding of the <strong>procedures</strong>, the kinds of <strong>errors</strong> that prompt a reviewing court to intervene, and the <strong>relief</strong> available, are the main learning goals of this subunit.</li>
<li>Immigration consultants are <strong>not permitted</strong> to apply for judicial review or represent clients in judicial review hearings。</li>
<li>Where internal appellate remedies are prescribed by the IRPA, those must be exhausted first.</li>
<li>An H &amp; C refusal can only be challenged by judicial review in the Federal Court of Canada.</li>
<li>Provincial superior courts may also hear applications for <em>habeas corpus</em> (A “writ” of <em>habeas corpus</em> is used to bring a prisoner or other detainee before the court to determine the lawfulness of the detention) from persons demanding to know whether their immigration detention is justified in law.</li>
<li>During a Federal Court Judicial Review hearing, the person whose case is the subject of the review <strong>does not testify</strong>.</li>
<li>Applications for judicial review are commenced with leave. Decisions on leave applications are rendered in a summary way which generally means in writing and without any reasons. <strong>Leave decisions are not subject to appeal</strong>.</li>
<li><strong>No appeal</strong> lies from the decision of the Court with respect to the application.</li>
<li>Judicial review applications proceed in five basic stages:<ul>
<li>Application for Leave</li>
<li>"Perfect Application" (Application Record)</li>
<li>Decision: Leave granted / not granted</li>
<li>If granted, further materials filed</li>
<li>Hearing is held</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Grounds of judicial review:<ul>
<li>acted without jurisdiction, acted beyond its jurisdiction or refused to exercise its jurisdiction;</li>
<li>failed to observe a principle of procedural fairness;</li>
<li>erred in law;</li>
<li>erroneous findings of fact;</li>
<li>fraud or perjured evidence;</li>
<li>contrary to law.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Courts show this respect by deferring to the tribunal in certain cases – that is, by accepting its decision even if they disagree with it.</li>
<li>the Supreme Court established a presumption that <strong>reasonableness</strong> is the applicable standard of review in all cases.</li>
<li>On judicial review, the court <strong>usually does not substitute</strong> its decision for that of the decision-maker.</li>
<li>In the immigration and citizenship context, the <em>Federal Courts Act</em> codifies the available remedies. However, you may find references to these writs in older case law so it is helpful to understand the terminology:<ul>
<li><strong><em>Certiorari</em></strong>: This is the most common; it involves quashing the decision and remitting it back for redetermination (usually by a different decision-maker)</li>
<li><strong><em>Mandamus</em></strong>: An order requiring a party to perform a specific legal duty that the decision-maker has failed to perform</li>
<li><strong><em>Prohibition</em></strong>: An order requiring a party not to do something</li>
<li><strong><em>Habeas Corpus</em></strong>: An order determining the legality of detention (“free the body”)</li>
<li><strong><em>Quo Warranto</em></strong>: This is the least common; it is used to challenge a person's entitlement to a public office that they purport to occupy and exercise</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Once a question is certified, the Federal Court of Appeal is not restricted to considering the certified question but may consider all issues raised by the appeal (<em>Baker</em>, at <a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/scc/doc/1999/1999canlii699/1999canlii699.html" target="_blank">para. 12</a> )</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details class="note">
<summary>3.5 The Constitution and the Charter</summary>
<ul>
<li>The Constitution Act of 1867 provides that immigration is a matter that is subject to concurrent or shared jurisdiction between the two levels of government. Nevertheless, the federal government has been the <strong>dominant</strong> player in this sphere.</li>
<li><em>Law Society of BC v. Mangat</em>. The Law Society of BC unsuccessfully challenged a provision of the former Immigration Act which permitted immigration consultants to represent individuals before the IRB.​</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details class="note">
<summary>3.6 The Evolution of the United Nations and the International Human Rights Framework</summary>
<ul>
<li>The <strong><em>Magna Carta</em></strong> of 1215 is widely considered to be one of the precursors to today’s international human rights framework.</li>
<li>Although there are 63 clauses in the Magna Carta, those that were foundational to evolving ideas about the rule of law and remain applicable today are clauses 39 and 40:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>“[39] No free man shall be seized, imprisoned, dispossessed, outlawed, exiled or ruined in any way, nor in any way proceeded against, except by the lawful judgement of his peers and the law of the land."</p>
<p>“[40] To no one will we sell, to no one will we deny or delay right or justice.”</p>
</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>Today’s international human rights framework emerged in the immediate aftermath of the devastation of World War II.</li>
<li>International law comes from a variety of sources. The two most significant are <strong>customary international law</strong> and <strong>treaty law</strong>. Customary international law is considered to be part of Canadian law to the extent that it modifies the common law. Treaty law is not considered to be part of Canadian law <strong>unless</strong> is has been duly passed into a Canadian statute by federal parliament or a provincial legislature, or in some cases both bodies.</li>
<li>Canada's ‘<strong>dualist</strong>’ approach to international law: Once the executive has ratified a treaty, other states can call upon Canada to honour its treaty commitments, but those commitments will not be part of Canadian law until either federal parliament or a provincial legislature has passed them into domestic statute.</li>
<li>International Law as an Advocacy Tool”: individual petition or complaint system and country reports.</li>

<li>
<p>Which of the following decisions typically would not attract a duty to act fairly?</p>

<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" checked/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Issuing immigration policy documents
<br><strong>Legislative or policy decisions establishing rules or guidelines are generally not subject to the duty to act fairly. See Nastasi et al., Chapter 2 “Foundations of Administrative Law” , p. 40-41.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Administrative law applies to:</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> the relationship between levels of Canadian government</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> administrative agencies, tribunals and government decision-makers</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> the exercise of powers granted by statute</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" checked/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> B and C
<br><strong>A is incorrect because the relationship between levels of government in Canada is governed by the <mark>Constitution</mark>, not administrative law.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which best describes the relationship between procedural fairness and natural justice?</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Procedural fairness requires every decision maker to attend to the Charter of Rights and Freedoms in making decisions whereas natural justice requires every decision maker to attend to the common law principles only.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Procedural fairness is the standard required of all agencies, including tribunals; whereas natural justice is the set of principles constituting fair procedure.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Procedural fairness requires that a person affected by a decision be given a formal hearing; whereas natural justice requires that the person be allowed to speak at their hearing.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" checked/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> None of the above
<br><strong>While natural justice was once seen as being distinct from procedural fairness, today the terms natural justice and procedural fairness are synonymous and can be used <mark>interchangeably</mark> – as noted in Nastasi et al, Chapter 2 "Foundations of Administrative Law", p. 25.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>True or false: Sarah Dunn is a newly appointed panel member with the Refugee Protection Division (RPD) of the IRB. Ms. Dunn was the sole decision-maker hearing a refugee claim and is unsure how she should decide the case. She decides to meet with two more experienced RPD members to consult with them on the case she just heard. This is not permissible under any circumstances.</p>

<br><strong><mark>Tribunal members are permitted to consult one another except where statutory limits or prohibitions are placed</mark> on the right to consult. Therefore, absent an exclusion or limitation in the IRPA, the enabling legislation of the IRB, Ms. Dunn is free to consult other tribunal members when making decisions. However, Ms. Dunn must be the one making the final decision; the consultation must be voluntary; no one can put pressure on her to make a particular decision; and no new issues or facts are to be introduced without the claimant being notified and permitted to comment. See, Nastasi et al., Chapter 2 “Foundations of Administrative Law” , p. 34.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Which of the following is not something courts can generally do when hearing judicial review applications?</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Declare that the action taken by a public official is contrary to the law</li>

<br><strong>As noted in Nastasi et al, Chapter 2 “Foundations of Administrative Law” at <mark>p. 54</mark>, courts hearing judicial review applications can do A, B, and C in addition to quashing a decision already made, forbid a public official from taking or continuing any action that is prohibited by law; and order an agency to free a person who is illegally imprisoned. However, disbanding an administrative tribunal is not an available remedy on judicial review.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>

<p>What test is used to determine whether or not a tribunal is impartial?</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Actual bias</li>

<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Probability of bias
<br><strong>As noted in Nastasi et al., in Chapter 2 “Foundations of Administrative Law” at p. 42, the test that has emerged from the case law is whether there is a “reasonable apprehension of bias” – not actual bias.</strong></li>
</ul>

<li>
<p>Which of the following is <mark>not true</mark> about guidelines?</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Policies and guidelines can be used to promote consistency and fairness in decision-making.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" checked/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Guidelines may be used to exclude choices provided by the law.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Guidelines must not be treated as binding.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Requiring government decision-makers to follow guidelines would be fettering of discretion.
<br><strong>Guidelines are not treated as binding rules and should not be used to justify the exclusion of choices provided by the law. See, Nastasi et al., Chapter 2 “Foundations of Administrative Law” , pp. 33-34.</strong></li>

<br><strong>Where a decision maker raises expectations that a certain procedure will be followed, either by promises or by a course of action on which people have come to rely, the decision maker may not change its practice or procedure where the change will have an adverse effect without first notifying the persons who will be affected and giving them an opportunity to comment on the proposed change.

<p>True or false: You are a legal representative who unsuccessfully represented your client at an administrative hearing. When you receive the decision, you are concerned that the adjudicator was biased. You would like to recommend that your client apply to the courts to review the decision, but the enabling statute of the administrative tribunal does not provide a right of appeal and contains a provision prohibiting the courts from reviewing the administrative tribunal’s decisions. It is therefore not possible to have the courts review the tribunal’s decision.</p>

<br><strong>Despite the enabling legislation not having a right of appeal and containing a provision prohibiting the courts from reviewing the decision, judicial review would still be available. Because the right to judicial review is constitutional in nature, it cannot be taken away by any provision of a statute purporting to deny the right.

<p>You are representing Raj at an admissibility hearing at the IRB. The Minister is alleging that there are reasonable grounds to believe Raj poses a threat to national security.

<br><strong>Certain kinds of behaviour toward the parties during a hearing and even outside the hearing room may suggest that a decision maker does not have an open mind.

The hurdle to overcome with these facts is that it seems Raj was the only person who overheard the Member’s statement. Nevertheless, the courts usually consider a party that does not raise an allegation of bias during the hearing to have waived the right to argue it in court. So it is important to <mark>raise the issue</mark> of an appearance of bias as early as possible. See Nastasi, c. 5, at p. 113.</strong></li>

<p>You are waiting for the elevator with your client, a refugee claimant, on the main floor of the building of the IRB to return to the hearing room after the lunch break. When the doors open, you see the presiding Member from the hearing chatting and appearing very familiar with the Minister's counsel from your client's hearing. As soon as they see you, their conversation stops.

<br><strong>Alleging that a tribunal member is or appears to be biased is a serious matter, and bias allegations should not be made lightly. Aside from any other reasons to exercise caution, the first rule of good advocacy is to not alienate the decision maker. Moreover, the courts have made it clear that restraint must be exercised when making such allegations. However, in this instance, a reviewing court would likely view the decision maker's close association with the Minister's counsel, a person whose interests may be affected by the outcome of the case, as rising to the level of disqualifying bias. Where it is necessary to initiate a motion on apprehension of bias, as is the case here, it is important to do so <mark>as soon as</mark> the question of bias or conflict of interest arises. The courts generally consider that a party who fails to raise an allegation of bias during a hearing to have waived the right to argue it subsequently in court.</strong></li>

<p>Why does Clutterbuck say that Baker’s appeal was not as much of a success as it initially appeared?</p>
<ul class="task-list">

<br><strong>See, Clutterbuck, at p 63: “I argue that Baker is an apt illustration of the <mark>inability of courts</mark> to recognize <mark>how people with intersecting vulnerabilities are targeted and attacked by administrative systems</mark>. I apply Spade’s notion of administrative violence to understand the violence committed against Ms. Baker by Canada’s immigration system and the epistemic violence of legal approaches that privilege procedural questions and ignore the centrality of race, gender, and disability as justiciable issues.” See also page 66: “The facts in Baker provided an opportune moment for the SCC to conceptualize racism, sexism, classism, and ableism as a feature in attitudes among certain personnel in Canada’s immigration system. However, the Court did not engage these central aspects of the case, sweeping their possible justiciability under the proverbial rug.”</strong></li>

<p>Your client Marcel has been having a tough time recently, and you notice that they are very nervous about their IRB hearing. During the hearing, the presiding member adopts a somewhat aggressive tone with some of the questions posed to your client. You agree that the Member’s tone has been a bit rude, but your client is really upset. These facts suggest that Marcel has a strong basis for asking the member to stand aside on the basis of reasonable apprehension of bias.</p>

<br><strong><mark>the threshold for bias is high</mark>. Bias must be obvious to the reasonable person and must be grounded in evidence. Remarks that are rude will likely not meet this high threshold – see de Grandpré’s dissent in <em>Committee for Justice and Liberty v National Energy Board</em> at para. 395. At the same time, if Marcel’s growing anxiety is negatively impacting his ability to provide testimony, a brief mid-hearing “conference” can be requested with the Board member to draw the Member’s attention to Marcel’s condition and request appropriate accommodations. Section 10.1 of Chairperson Guideline 8: Procedures with respect to vulnerable persons appearing before the IRB (which you will learn about in the Refugee Protection course) confirms: “The IRB ensures that all those who appear at its hearings or other proceedings are questioned with sensitivity and respect. This obligation is all the more important in the case of vulnerable persons.

<p>You are an RCIC representing Salem who has been detained by CBSA for almost a year. Salem has been denied release in every preceding detention review hearing before the Immigration Division of the IRB. He is desperate to be released. You are aware that decisions of the Immigration Division could be judicially reviewed in Federal Court. A habeas corpus application may offer another avenue for challenging the legality of Salem’s continuing detention. What should you do?</p>

<p>Which one of the following circumstances is <strong>NOT</strong> an exception to reasonableness as the default standard of review on judicial review:</p>

<p><strong>In <em>Vavilov</em>, the Supreme Court clarified that the presumption of reasonableness review (for judicial review as opposed to statutory appeals), may be rebutted:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>where the <strong>legislature</strong> has indicated that a different standard should apply; or</li>

<p><strong>The Supreme Court further confirmed that this will be the case for questions that fall within one of three categories:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li><strong>constitutional questions</strong>, including the constitutional division of powers, whether provisions of a decision-maker’s enabling statute infringe the Charter;</li>
<li>and general questions of law of central <strong>importance to the legal system</strong> as a whole, which require uniform and consistent answers as a result of their impact on the administration of justice as a whole.</li>

<p>There has been significant disagreement within the Refugee Appeal Division (RAD) concerning the degree of risk faced by an ethnic minority in country X. About a third of the decisions dealing with appeals from country X in the past six months have been based on clear findings about the deteriorating human rights situation in the country, while the balance have found that state protection for the minority population remains adequate. You represented Ana in her appeal before the RAD. Ana fears return to country X. Her appeal is rejected and she has retained new counsel to pursue a judicial review application. <strong>The existence of internal disagreement within the RAD will rebut the presumption of reasonableness in Ana’s case.</strong></p>

<p>Your client is a business class immigrant and owns a parcel of land within the city limits that was subject to an expropriation order. The Expropriations Tribunal upheld the expropriation to facilitate the construction of an extension to the city’s subway system. This Tribunal is exercising a statutory power under the provincial Expropriations Act. Your client did not receive notice of the hearing before the Tribunal. She learned that a hearing had been convened when she received a decision letter in the mail. The consequence of this decision is that your client’s plans to build a shopping mall on the property have been upended, resulting in significant financial losses. Your client intends to invoke a provision in the Expropriations Act to request that the Tribunal reconsider the matter. For the reconsideration hearing, the Tribunal can apply the following authorities to this matter:</p>

<p>In <em>Law Society of British Columbia v Mangat</em>, the Supreme Court of Canada found that immigration as a subject matter fell within provincial and federal jurisdiction. Why, then, did it assign responsibility for the matter to the federal government?</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Because it is more efficient to only have one level of government legislating in the area</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Because the Court trusts the federal government more</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Because the paramountcy doctrine says the federal government’s historical involvement in relation to naturalization and aliens must be respected</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" checked/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Because the <strong>paramountcy doctrine</strong> stipulates that the federal government prevails where there is conflict between federal and provincial legislation
<br><strong>Section 95 of the Constitution Act, 1867 grants to both the federal and provincial legislatures the jurisdiction to legislate in relation to immigration. Where there is an operational conflict, the federal government’s jurisdiction will prevail. See, Aiken, Grey, c. 4.</strong></li>

<p>Your client recently attended an admissibility hearing at the IRB to determine whether they are a national security risk.

This involves weighing whether the decision achieves a reasonable balance between furthering the objectives of the statutory regime under which the decision is made and the values underlying the Charter.

<p>According to the short film “The Story of Human Rights,” the history of human rights begins in:</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Ancient Greece with Alexander the Great</li>

<br><strong>Frans Viljoen begins the history of human rights with the Magna Carta in England and the American Declaration of Independence in 1776, but the short film “The Story of Human Rights” reaches farther back in history and points to ancient Babylon / Persia and the Cyrus Cylinder as the first important milestone on the path to the Universal Declaration of Human Rights (1948).</strong></li>

<p>The authors of “Bots at the Gate: A Human Rights Analysis of Automated Decision-Making in Canada’s Immigration and Refugee System” (2018) highlight which of the following as cause for concern:</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Immigration and refugee law is a high-stakes context, in which people’s lives hang in the balance.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Canada’s immigration and refugee system is already the source of human rights concerns, and automating it will be tantamount to endorsing the status quo of a flawed system.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Migrants have limited access to human rights protections and resources with which to defend those rights.</li>

<p>According to James Hathaway, the critical shortcomings of the 2018 Global Compact on Refugees include:</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> a failure to remedy the operational deficiencies of the Refugee Convention</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> a failure to include adequate consultative mechanism for stakeholder groups</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> that every large movement of refugees will require a new agreement</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" checked/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> A and C</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> B and C
<br><strong>Hathaway describes the Refugee Compact process as “thin” and implies that it was an error not to aim for a binding protocol to <mark>remedy</mark> the operational deficiencies of the Refugee Convention. He also notes that its application to undefined “large” movements will yield a “never-ending series of discussions”. The one clear output of the Compact is that there will be “<mark>lots and lots of meetings</mark>”, ruling out B.</strong></li>

<p>True or false: The authors of “Bots at the Gate: A Human Rights Analysis of Automated Decision-Making in Canada’s Immigration and Refugee System” (2018) are fundamentally opposed to the use of automated decision-making in Canada’s immigration and refugee system.</p>

<br><strong>The authors of “Bots at the Gate” are concerned about the potential for human rights abuses, but they are <mark>not fundamentally opposed</mark> to the idea of automated decision-making.

<ol class="task-list">
<li>According to Frans Viljoen’s “International Human Rights Law: A Short History,” the history of human rights is best described as:</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> A global history under the guidance of the United Nation’s Charter</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> A regional history under three large umbrellas: the Council of Europe, the Organization of the American States (OAS) and the Organization for African Unity (OAU)</li>

<br><strong>Viljoen organizes his text in such a way as to emphasize that human rights work is <mark>done at many different, interrelated levels (global, regional, sub-regional and nongovernmental)</mark>. He dispels the popular notion that human rights are the sole purview of the United Nations.</strong></li>

<p>In “Committee Against Torture, Concluding observations on the seventh periodic report of Canada” (2018), the Committee recommends that the State “consider undertaking an assessment of the impact of the Safe Third Country Agreement on potential asylum seekers arriving from”:</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Afghanistan</li>

<br><strong>Although Canada considers the United States a safe country for asylum claimants to seek and obtain protection when they meet the definition of a refugee, the Committee is concerned about an increase “in the number of individuals in the United States wishing to seek asylum in Canada in an attempt to flee aggressive anti-immigration policies” and asks Canada to reassess whether the US is indeed a safe country for asylum claimants.</strong></li>

<p>How can international law be used as an advocacy tool in Canadian migration law?</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> the individual complaints procedure and the group complaints procedure</li>

<br><strong>In “International Human Rights Standards &amp; Immigration Law – Part 2”, Aiken, Grey et al make no distinction between individual complaints and group complaints, which rules out Answer A. Answer B is partially true insofar as the UN reporting process subjects countries like Canada to public/media scrutiny, but the UN reports themselves (not the media coverage of them) represent the advocacy tool, which makes C the best answer. Answer D refers to the same thing using two different terms: the “individual complaints procedure” and “appeals to the UN system” are one and the same.</strong></li>

<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> The automated drones that patrol national borders force migrants to take more dangerous migration routes, which results in an increased number of deaths.</li>

<p>According to the short film “The Story of Human Rights,” this history of human rights is best described as:</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> A slow but straight-forward trajectory toward the liberation of humankind from absolutist rule</li>

<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> A fast-paced and straight-forward trajectory toward a cosmopolitan future in which all people enjoy equal rights
<br><strong>“The Story of Human Rights” portrays the development of human rights as <mark>slow but not straight forward</mark>, which rules out A and D. Answer C may sound familiar as Frans Vilijoen hints at the origin of human rights in the weaknesses of liberal democracy and “majority rule.” Answer B is the best summary of the short film “The Story of Human Rights” as it captures both the speed of the development as well as the back and forth between progress (e.g., the Magna Carta) and regression (e.g., the Holocaust) in the history of human rights.</strong></li>

<br><strong>According to Aiken, Grey, Canada has not ratified the Convention on the Protection of the Rights of All Migrant Workers and Members of their Families, which rules out Answers A and B.

<br><strong>The Magna Carta did not establish the separation of church and state.

The Magna Carta also <mark>did not establish England as a constitutional democratic monarchy</mark>, though it was a stepping stone in that direction (which rules out Answer C). “Carta” means “charter” in Latin, not “map” (which rules out Answer D).</strong></li>
