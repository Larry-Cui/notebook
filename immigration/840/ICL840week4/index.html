<summary>FSW: Minimum Requirements</summary>
<ul>
<li>R75(1): For the purposes of subsection 12(2) of the Act, the federal skilled worker class is hereby prescribed as a class of persons who are skilled workers and who may become permanent residents on the basis of their ability to become <strong>economically established</strong> in Canada and who intend to <strong>reside in a province</strong> other than the Province of Quebec.</li>
<li>According to section 77 of the IRPR, these requirements and criteria must be met on the date on which an <strong>application is made</strong> and on the date on which a permanent resident <strong>visa is issued</strong>.</li>
<li>it is helpful to divide the regulations for the Federal Skilled Worker Class into three parts:<ul>
<li>The minimum requirements: s 75, s 76(1)(b) and s 82(1)(a), (b) or (d) of the IRPR</li>
<li>The criteria used to evaluate and admit: s 76 and s 85</li>
<li>Provisions detailing the application of each criterion: ss 77-83</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the requirements of subsection <strong>75(2)</strong>:<ul>
<li><strong>Previous work experience</strong> in a skilled occupation, assessed using the National Occupational Classification (NOC).</li>
<li>Proficiency in an official <strong>language</strong>, based a language test administered by a designated institution and meeting thresholds established by the Minister.</li>
<li>A Canadian <strong>educational</strong> credential, or a foreign diploma along with an equivalency assessment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>76(1)(b) establishes that to be accepted a skilled worker must have:<ul>
<li>Sufficient settlement <strong>funds</strong> or</li>
<li>Points for arranged <strong>employment</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>regarding <mark>work experience</mark>, paragraphs 75(2)(a) to (c) establish that:<ul>
<li>in the <strong>10 years</strong> before the date of application</li>
<li>the applicant must have accumulated over a <strong>continuous period</strong></li>
<li>at least <strong>1 year of full-time</strong> work experience,</li>
<li>or the <strong>equivalent in part-time</strong> work,</li>
<li>in their <strong>primary occupation</strong> (as identified in their application)</li>
<li>other than in a <strong>restricted</strong> occupation, and</li>
<li>which is listed in <strong>TEER Category 0, 1, 2 or 3</strong> of the NOC (formerly Skill Type 0 Management Occupations or Skill Level A or B of the NOC matrix).</li>
<li>In addition, during the period of employment, the applicant:<ul>
<li>must have performed “the actions described in the <strong>lead statement</strong> for the occupation” as set out in the NOC, and</li>
<li>must have performed “a substantial number of the <strong>main duties</strong> of the occupation as set out in the occupational descriptions” of the NOC, “including all of the essential duties.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><mark>Settlement Funds</mark> or Arranged Employment. s 76(1)(b) of the IRPR states that the skilled worker must:<ul>
<li>(i) have in the form of <strong>transferable and available funds</strong>, unencumbered by debts or other obligations, an amount equal to <strong>one half of the minimum necessary income</strong> applicable in respect of the group of persons consisting of the <strong>skilled worker and their family members</strong>, <strong>or</strong></li>
<li>(ii) be awarded points under paragraph 82(2)(a), (b) or (d) for <strong>arranged employment</strong>, as defined in subsection 82(1), in Canada</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>A similar requirement applies under the Federal Skilled Trades Class (see IRPR, s 87.2(3)(d)(ii), (iii) and (v) and (5)), but <strong>not</strong> the Canadian Experience Class.</li>
<li>Essential Case Review. These requirements are the subject of <em>Gugliotti v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, <a href="http://canlii.ca/t/gx2cl" target="_blank">2017 FC 71</a>.<ul>
<li>[34] I agree with the Applicant that the <strong>regulations do not specify the manner of proof of the required financial information to be filed</strong>. While the regulations do set out the requirement to provide proof of settlement funds, they do not specify what is, or is not accepted as proof; they are silent as to the means by which an applicant may satisfy the obligation to demonstrate sufficient establishment funds. All parties are in agreement to this point as is the Court.</li>
<li>[36] It is also trite to observe that <strong>if a Visa Officer has concerns with the reliability of documents, and reasonably requests addition information to weigh or assess the evidence filed, an Applicant may either provide that information or be prepared to see his or her application denied.</strong> There is no suggestion that a Visa Officer must obtain regulatory approval before reasonably asking for further and better verification; the authority to demand more, assuming it is reasonably exercised, flows directly from, and in my view is inextricably bound up with, the Officers’ duty to weigh and assess the evidence before them.</li>
<li>[39] I should note that <strong>no one suggested requiring this extra level of verification is in any way unreasonable</strong>; an applicant merely need his or her financial institution to send an official letter in relation to its records which in my respectful view is quite reasonable. It is no different than asking a person who submits a photocopy of a property deed to provide a notarial copy where reasonable, or asking a person who submits a photocopy of a letter to provide the original where reasonable. And it makes no difference, in my view, if requirements for verification are made known before or after the material is submitted, although common sense suggests it is preferable for all concerned that applicants know in advance, as was the case here.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>to exempt an applicant from the need to prove they have adequate settlement funds, the <mark>arranged employment</mark> must be one of three kinds:<ul>
<li>Under paragraph 82(2)(a) of the IRPR, LMIA-based or exempted job offer.</li>
<li>TEER 0, 1, 2 or 3.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Summary</strong>. Minimum Requirements for admission to permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Worker Class:<ul>
<li><strong>One’s year of work continuous, full-time work</strong> experience in a skilled occupation, assessed using the <strong>TEER Category 0, 1, 2 or 3</strong> of the NOC (formerly Skill Type 0 Management Occupations or Skill Level A or B of the NOC matrix), <strong>within the previous 10 years</strong>.</li>
<li>Sufficient proficiency in an official <strong>language</strong>, as demonstrated by the results of a language test administered by a designated institution within the <strong>last two years</strong> and meeting thresholds established by the Minister.</li>
<li>In the case of the Federal Skilled Worker Class, that means the applicant must have attained <strong>level 7</strong> for each language skill area under the Canadian Language Benchmarks or the Niveaux de competence linguistique canadiens.</li>
<li>A Canadian <strong>educational credential</strong>, or a foreign diploma along with an equivalency assessment that is less than five years old.</li>
<li>Either transferable and available <strong>funds</strong>, unencumbered by debt, amounting to 1/2 of the minimum income necessary to support the applicant’s family or points for <strong>arranged employment</strong> under three defined situations.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details class="note">
<summary>FSW Class: The Points System</summary>
<ul>
<li>The starting point for understanding the regulatory point system for the Federal Skilled Worker Class is the list of selection criteria set out in paragraph <strong>76(1)(a)</strong> of the IRPR.</li>
<li><strong>Six</strong> criteria: education, proficiency in an official language, experience, age, arranged employment, and adaptability.</li>
<li>Subsection <strong>76(2)</strong> says that the Minister must fix the number of points based on <strong>three factors</strong>: the number of skilled worker applications currently being <strong>processed</strong>, the number of skilled workers <strong>projected</strong> to become permanent residents, and the <strong>potential</strong> for the establishment of skilled workers in Canada.</li>
<li>For many years, the minimum number of points has been fixed at <mark>67</mark>.<ul>
<li>Education: s 78</li>
<li>Language: s 79</li>
<li>Experience: s 80 (must be in an occupation listed in TEER Category 0,1, 2 or 3)</li>
<li>Age: s 81</li>
<li>Arranged employment: ss 82, 83<ul>
<li>to receive points, the employment offer must fall within one of four different categories:<ul>
<li>First, paragraph 82(2)(a) of the IRPR applies in the case of applicants who are in Canada</li>
<li>Second, paragraph 82(2)(b) of the IRPR also applies to cases where an applicant is in Canada</li>
<li>Third, paragraph 82(2)(c) of the IRPR covers cases where an applicant is not authorized to work in Canada on the date of their application but has received an offer that meets the definition of “arranged employment” and which has been approved by an immigration officer based on a positive LMIA</li>
<li>Finally, paragraph 82(2)(d) of the IRPR awards points where the applicant is working in Canada either under a valid work permit or they are authorized to work in Canada without a permit</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>

<li>Adaptability: s 83</li>

<summary>Exploring Substituted Evaluation</summary>
<ul>
<li>The criteria used in assigning points under the points system to see whether an applicant <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/express-entry/eligibility/federal-skilled-workers/six-selection-factors-federal-skilled-workers.html" target="_blank">obtains the pass mark of 67 points</a>.</li>
<li>Circumstances for officer’s substituted evaluation. Subsections <strong>76(3) and (4)</strong> of the IRPR state:<ul>
<li>(3) Whether or not the skilled worker has been awarded the minimum number of required points referred to in subsection (2), an officer may <strong>substitute</strong> for the criteria set out in paragraph (1)(a) their evaluation of the likelihood of the ability of the skilled worker to become economically established in Canada if the number of points awarded is not a sufficient indicator of whether the skilled worker may become economically established in Canada.</li>
<li>(4) An evaluation made under subsection (3) requires the <strong>concurrence</strong> of a second officer.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>IRCC’s <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/permanent-residence/economic-classes/federal-skilled-workers/making-selection-decision.html" target="_blank">online operational instructions</a> for substituted evaluation decisions provide guidance to officers on how to make substituted evaluation decisions under subsections 76(3) and (4) of the IRPR.</li>
<li>Now comes the tricky part: since the implementation of Express Entry in January 2015, all new FSW applications have been processed in that system, with a set of Ministerial Instructions. You will see in the <strong>Departmental guidance</strong> above that substituted evaluation does <strong>not apply</strong> to Ministerial Instructions.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details class="note">
<summary>CEC Regulations</summary>
<ul>
<li>Unlike the Federal Skilled Worker Class, selection under the Canadian Experience Class is on a <strong>pass-fail basis</strong> rather than assigning an applicant points. As its name suggests, membership in the class is determined by whether you have the requisite <strong>Canadian</strong> experience—meaning <strong>work experience</strong>.</li>
<li>The regulations for the Canadian Experience Class are found in a single provision, <strong>section 87.1</strong>.</li>
<li>Paragraphs 87.1(2)(a) to (c) state that an applicant must have acquired in the <strong>previous 3 years</strong> at least <strong>1 year's full-time</strong> work experience, or the <strong>equivalent in part-time</strong> work, in one or more occupations that are listed in TEER 0,1,2,3<ul>
<li>In <em>Kumar</em>, the Court said “the real question for the visa officer is to determine the pith and substance of the work performed by the Applicant.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Paragraph 87.1(2)(d) and (e) state that the applicant must submit the results of an approved language test that is less than 2 years’ old.<ul>
<li>For occupations in <strong>TEER 0 or 1</strong> (formerly Skill Type 0 or Skill Level A), applicants must achieve at least Canadian Language Benchmark <strong>(CLB) 7</strong> for each language ability.</li>
<li>For occupations in <strong>TEER 2 or 3</strong> (formerly Skill Level B), applicants must achieve <strong>CLB 5</strong> for each language ability.</li>

<summary>The Federal Skilled Trades Class Regulations</summary>
<ul>
<li>In contrast to the other two categories seen in this module, however, relatively few people come to Canada each year under the Federal Skilled Trades Class. In 2021, there were only <strong>500</strong> admissions to permanent residence in this category.</li>
<li>The IRPR <strong>s 87.1(1)</strong> limit the trades included in the class to six types, classified according to major, minor and unit groups listed under TEER 2 and 3 of NOC 2021</li>
<li>Subsection <strong>87.2(2)</strong> of the IRPR establishes the Federal Skilled Trades Class</li>
<li>Subsection 87.2(3) of the IRPR sets out the requirements for admission under the Federal Skilled Trades Class.<ul>
<li>CLB 5 for speaking and listening and CLB 4 for reading and writing.</li>
<li>paragraph 87.2(3)(b) requires <strong>2 years of full-time</strong> work experience, or the equivalent in part-time work experience, in the <strong>5 years prior</strong> to the application.</li>
<li>The experience must be in one of the groups listed in subsection 87.2(1).</li>
<li>the applicant must have performed the actions in the <strong>lead statement</strong> from the NOC for the specified occupation, as well as a substantial number of the <strong>main duties</strong> and all the essential duties.</li>
<li>s 87.2(3)(c): requires that an applicant meet employment requirements.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Subsection 87.2(5) also requires the applicant to have sufficient settlement funds (unencumbered transferable and available funds) equal to <strong>1/2 the minimum necessary income</strong> for the applicant and their family members, <strong>unless</strong> they have a qualifying offer of employment from up to two different employers to continue in work that they are already authorized to perform in Canada.</li>
<li>Subsection 87.5(4) sets out a power for officers to <strong>substitute</strong> their own evaluation of an applicant’s likelihood of becoming economically established in Canada<ul>
<li>In Cabral v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration), <a href="http://canlii.ca/t/hpqtg" target="_blank">2018 FCA 4</a><ul>
<li>[47] … there is nothing in subsection 87.2(4) of the IRPR that creates a right to the conduct of a substitute evaluation. Rather, the <strong>provision is a permissive one and grants the right to Immigration Officers</strong> (and <strong>not to applicants</strong>) to conduct a substitute evaluation in the prescribed circumstances.</li>
<li>this statement leaves it unclear as to whether an officer is required to consider substituted evaluation if requested by the applicant.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details class="note">
<summary>Procedural Fairness Letters</summary>
<ul>
<li>one aspect of procedural fairness is that an applicant must be made aware of the case they have to meet: see <em>Akhtar v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, <a href="http://canlii.ca/t/hxn8z" target="_blank">2019 FC 123</a> at para 19; <em>Canadian Pacific Railway Company v Canada (Attorney General)</em>, <a href="http://canlii.ca/t/hrgf2" target="_blank">2018 FCA 69</a> at para 56.<ul>
<li>[19] Justice Rennie, writing for the Federal Court of Appeal in CP, made it clear that <strong>an applicant must be aware of the case to meet in order to have a fair process</strong>.  There, the Federal Court of Appeal clarified that there is an inherent “awkwardness” to “shoehorn” the question of procedural fairness into a standard of review analysis.  Evaluating whether a decision-maker provided a procedurally fair process requires the reviewing court to ask “whether the procedure was fair having regard to all of the circumstances” and “with a sharp focus on the nature of the substantive rights involved and the consequences for an individual, whether a fair and just process was followed” (CP at paras 54–55).  Ultimately, the reviewing court must first determinate <strong>whether the applicant knew the case to meet</strong>, and second, whether he or she had <strong>a full and fair chance to respond</strong> (CP at para 56).</li>
<li>[56] No matter how much deference is accorded administrative tribunals in the exercise of their discretion to make procedural choices, the ultimate question remains <strong>whether the applicant knew the case to meet and had a full and fair chance to respond</strong>. It would be problematic if an a priori decision as to whether the standard of review is correctness or reasonableness generated a different answer to what is a singular question that is fundamental to the concept of justice: <strong>was the party given a right to be heard and the opportunity to know the case against them?</strong> Procedural fairness is not sacrificed on the altar of deference.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>This is also reflected in Immigration, Refugees and Citizenship Canada’s <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/corporate/publications-manuals/operational-bulletins-manuals/service-delivery/procedural-fairness.html" target="_blank">operational instructions on procedural fairness</a>. It is worthwhile to take note of how these instructions explain this principle:<ul>
<li>To ensure that the applicant has a meaningful opportunity to participate, decision-makers must give sufficient notice about any process or interview that could result in a decision on their application and must give the applicant a reasonable opportunity to bring evidence or make arguments supporting their application. Decision-makers should tell applicants <strong>which documents may be required in order to address concerns</strong>. Sufficient information should be included on interview invitation letters to allow applicants to prepare. If any additional concerns arise from an interview, decision-makers should provide the applicant with an opportunity to address those concerns either at the interview or subsequent to the interview, through a procedural fairness letter.</li>
<li>The right to be heard requires that an applicant be given <strong>a meaningful opportunity to take part in the process</strong>. This requirement also applies in regard to information received from third parties, including IRCC partners. While this does not mean that the decision-maker must provide the physical documents consulted during the decision-making process (<em>El Maghraoui v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, <a href="http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/fc-cf/decisions/en/item/62526/index.do?r=AAAAAQAJYXVndXN0IDIwAQ" target="_blank">2013 FC 883</a>), there is a requirement that the <strong>essence of the decision-maker’s concerns be communicated to the applicant</strong> (<em>Krishnamoorthy v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, <a href="http://decisions.fct-cf.gc.ca/fc-cf/decisions/en/item/60187/index.do?r=AAAAAQAOa3Jpc2huYW1vb3J0aHkB" target="_blank">2011 FC 1342</a>) and that the applicant is advised of the specific provisions of the Act at issue. What is important is that the decision-maker’s concerns are adequately communicated to the applicant, who must then be given a reasonable opportunity to respond.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The purpose of procedural fairness letters is described in <em>Bui v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, <a href="http://canlii.ca/t/hzrhg" target="_blank">2019 FC 440</a>:<ul>
<li>[29] An officer may put concerns to an applicant by way of a procedural fairness letter. Said letter must contain enough detail to enable the applicant to know the case to meet, meaning that <strong>the applicant is provided with a reasonable understanding of why the officer is inclined to deny the application</strong> (<em>Bayramov v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, <a href="https://canlii.ca/t/hxvtz" target="_blank">2019 FC 256</a> at para 15; <em>Ezemenari v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, <a href="https://canlii.ca/t/frt67" target="_blank">2012 FC 619</a> at para 11). In other words, an applicant should not be “kept in the dark” about the information upon which an officer may render a decision (<em>Chawla v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, <a href="https://canlii.ca/t/g6sdg" target="_blank">2014 FC 434</a> at para 19). (Emphasis added.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Procedural fairness letters are less common in applications for permanent residence under the Economic Class, as compared to other types of applications.</li>
<li><em>Kapoor v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, <a href="http://canlii.ca/t/hnsdw" target="_blank">2017 FC 1002</a><ul>
<li>On judicial review, the decision was challenged in part on the basis that the visa officer did not properly discuss <strong>all</strong> the evidence submitted.</li>
<li>[19] … <strong>A visa officer does not need to mention every piece of evidence</strong> in his or her reasons for a decision; and, moreover, it is assumed that an officer weighed and considered all of the evidence before him or her, unless the contrary is shown.</li>
<li>The <em>Kapoor</em> decision, therefore, shows that a failure to <strong>respond effectively</strong> to a procedural fairness letter may lead to a refusal of an application.</li>

<li>
<p>Joan has been invited to apply for permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Worker Class. She has arranged employment to work in Toronto as a mathematician and is currently in Toronto under a new work permit that was issued based on a positive Labour Market Impact Assessment, or LMIA. She is married, with a child (12 years old) from a previous marriage. Her husband, Paul, has three children (ages 14, 16, and 20), also from a previous marriage. Pauls' ex-wife, Ann, lives in Toronto, where Joan and Paul are planning to live. Ann is now married to Gemma. Together, Ann and Gemma have adopted two children (ages 4 and 6). Gemma has a daughter from a previous marriage who is 24 and who has always relied on her financially and continues to do so. Gemma cannot get a job because she is a recovering drug addict. What amount of settlement funds must Joan prove she has available to her?</p>

<p>Answer: <strong>Joan need not prove she has any settlement funds, since she has arranged employment.</strong> Under paragraph 76(1)(b) of the IRPR, she need only show she has sufficient settlement funds if she has not received arranged employment under either IRPR, ss 82(2)(a), (b) or (d). The arranged employment described in this case seems to fall under IRPR, s 82(2)(d).</p>

<p>After having received an invitation, your client is applying for permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Worker Class. He enters his occupation as "mechanical engineer" (NOC 21301). The reference letter from his employer states that he:</p>
<p>"managed projects, and prepared cost and timing estimates; reviewed and approve designs, calculations and cost estimates; prepared contract documents and evaluated tenders for industrial construction or maintenance; analyzed the dynamics and vibrations of mechanical systems and structures; and supervised technicians, technologists and other engineers."</p>
<p>According to this statement, does your client meet the requirements of paragraph 75(2)(c) of the IRPR?  You will have to look up "mechanical engineer" in the National Occupational Classification to answer.</p>

<p>Answer: Yes, but it should be acknowledged that it is borderline. <strong>This statement approximately corresponds a few of the main duties listed for mechanical engineers.</strong> That leaves the officer some discretion to refuse the application on the ground that the requirements of paragraph 75(2)(c) are not sufficiently met.</p>

<p>Jean is a citizen of France. He has been invited to apply for permanent residence under the Federal Skilled Worker Class. He is married to Saul, a citizen of the United Kingdom. Jean has a biological daughter (Audrey, 8 years old) from a previous marriage. Saul has a biological son (Mack, aged 12) also from a previous marriage.</p>
<p>Saul's ex-wife, Anita, is a Canadian citizen and lives in Montreal, although Jean and Saul are planning to live in Edmonton. Anita is now married to Herbert, also a Canadian citizen. Anita and Herbert have no children together, but Herbert has a 28-year-old biological daughter, Barbara, from a previous marriage. Barbara is a Canadian citizen, but she lives and works in New York City with her boyfriend; they are both highly successful lawyers.</p>
<p>Jean can provide a letter showing that he has $23,921 in unencumbered funds. Does he have sufficient settlement funds for his application to be accepted?</p>

<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" checked/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> No<blockquote>
<p>Answer: No. Since there is no mention of arranged employment, Jean must show he has <strong>1/2 the minimum necessary income necessary to support his family members</strong> (IRPR, s <strong>76(1)(b)(i)</strong>). His family members include himself and his spouse and their dependent children (IRPR, s 1(3)). Here that means that he must show he has 1/2 the minimum necessary income to <strong>support 4 people</strong> (himself, Saul, and their two biological children). According to the table provided by IRCC, that means he needs $27,297 in settlement funds (as of 28 May 2024). This answer may change in subsequent years, since the low-income cut-offs are recalculated each year by Statistics Canada.</p>

<p><em>Patil v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, <a href="http://canlii.ca/t/j6mxv" target="_blank">2020 FC 495</a> involves a similar issue to the one at issue in Qin. The immigration officer in Patil also refused an application after taking into account the wages of the applicant, a citizen of India. Justice Ahmed, however, found in his case that the officer had erred.</p>
<p>Please turn to <em>Patil</em> and answer the following question: Given the authority in Qin, did Justice Ahmed err in reaching his conclusion?
- [ ] Yes
- [x] No</p>
<blockquote>
<p>No. In <em>Patil</em>, Justice Ahmed allowed the judicial review on the basis that the officer's decision was procedurally unfair. The officer's notes revealed that the applicant's wages gave rise to credibility concerns. When there are credibility concerns (see para 41) or an "overall skepticism" regarding an applicant's claim, the applicant must be given notice and an opportunity to respond. (In any event, in Qin, it was agreed that there had been a breach of procedural fairness quite apart from the substantive issue determined by the Federal Court of Appeal.)</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <em>Qin v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, 2013 FCA 263, Justice Evans found that the salary paid to an applicant for employment in Canada is a criterion for acceptance under the Canadian Experience Class.</p>

<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" checked/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> False<blockquote>
<p>At para 48 of Qin, Justice Evans writes:
it is not a statutory condition to the grant of a visa under the CEC program that an applicant's wages must be consistent with the prevailing local wage rates for the occupation in which the applicant is being assessed. Wages are simply one of the many considerations that may be relevant to determining whether a CEC applicant satisfies the prescribed work experience requirement.
In other words, <strong>wages are relevant, but they are not a criterion for acceptance</strong>.</p>

<li>
<p>Based on Justice Ahmed's reasons in Patil, would it have been open to the officer to reject the application on the basis that the letter did not establish that the applicant had sufficient qualifying work experience?</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Yes</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" checked/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> No<blockquote>
<p>No. Justice Ahmed notes that <strong>the officer did not find that the employment letter "did not accurately or sufficiently list the required duties of [the applicant's</strong>] claimed position[.]" This distinguishes the case from Qin, where there were doubts about the sufficiency of the applicant's employment letter.</p>

</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>In <em>Qin v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, 2013 FCA 263, Justice Evans found that when the Officer was assessing probative evidence before them, they must rely on express statutory authority to do so.</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> True</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" checked/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> False<blockquote>
<p><strong>Express statutory authority is not required to enable administrative decision-makers to consider evidence</strong> that has probative value with respect to a question entrusted to them. It is normally implicit in the grant of legal authority to decide a question of fact that the decision-maker may consider evidence relevant to making that decision.</p>
