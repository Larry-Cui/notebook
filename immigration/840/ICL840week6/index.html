<summary>Start-up Business Class</summary>
<ul>
<li>The Start-Up Business Class began as a 5-year pilot program launched using ministerial instructions in 2013. The federal government made the class permanent in <strong>2018</strong>.</li>
<li>The current regulations for the Start-Up Business Class are now found in sections 98.01 to 98.13 of the IRPR.</li>
<li>the <strong>Start-Up Business Class</strong>, the <strong>Self-Employed Persons Class</strong>, and <strong>Quebec business immigration classes</strong>.</li>
<li>Subsection 98.01(1) of the IRPR establishes the Start-Up Business Class as a class of persons who may become permanent residents<ul>
<li>on the basis of their ability to become <strong>economically established</strong> in Canada,</li>
<li>who meet the requirements of <strong>subsection (2)</strong>, and</li>
<li>who intend to <strong>reside</strong> in a province or territory other than Quebec.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Subsection 98.01(2) then sets out the main requirements for the class:<ul>
<li>The applicant must demonstrate official <strong>language</strong> proficiency through an approved language test. (CLB 5)</li>
<li>The applicant must have sufficient settlement <strong>funds</strong>. (50% of LICO, <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/application/application-forms-guides/proof-funds-start-business-class.html" target="_blank">online guide</a>)</li>
<li>The applicant must have started a <strong>qualifying business</strong>.</li>
<li>The applicant must have obtained a <strong>commitment</strong> from a designated entity to support the business.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>an applicant must have started a “qualifying business” and must have obtained a “commitment” from one or more “designated entities” that is less than 6 months old.</li>
<li>subsection 98.01(3) makes clear that <strong>up to 5</strong> foreign nationals can apply as founders of the same business.</li>
<li><strong>Rules for Qualifying Businesses</strong>. There are four requirements established by subsection 98.06(1):<ul>
<li>The applicant must provide <strong>active and ongoing management</strong> of the business.</li>
<li>That active and ongoing management must be from <strong>within Canada</strong>.</li>
<li>An <strong>essential part</strong> of the business’s operations must be <strong>conducted in Canada</strong>.</li>
<li>The business must be <strong>incorporated</strong> in Canada.</li>
<li>The business must have an <strong>ownership structure</strong> that complies with certain percentage requirements established by the Minister of IRCC.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Currently, the ownership structure requirements established by the Minister are:<ul>
<li>that each applicant must hold <strong>10% or more</strong> of the voting rights attached to all outstanding shares of the corporation; and</li>
<li>that the applicants and the designated entity that has entered into a commitment with them <strong>jointly hold more than 50%</strong> of the total voting rights attached to all outstanding shares.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details class="note">
<summary>The Start-Up Business Class: Designated Entities and Commitments</summary>
<ul>
<li>Three kinds of organizations may be designated, as set out in subsection 98.03(1):<ul>
<li><strong>Business incubators</strong>: The IRCC website currently lists over 40 designated business incubators.</li>
<li><strong>Angel investor groups</strong>: The IRCC website currently lists 6 angel investors.</li>
<li><strong>Venture capital funds</strong>: The IRCC website currently lists 26 venture capital funds.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>To be designated, an organization must belong to one of 2 industry associations, the <a href="https://www.cvca.ca/membership/" target="_blank">Canadian Venture Capital &amp; Private Equity Association</a> (for venture capital funds) or the <a href="https://www.nacocanada.com/cpages/start-up-visa" target="_blank">National Angel Capital Organization</a> (for angel investors and business incubators).</li>
<li>on April 30, 2024, the Minister announced Designated Entities would only be permitted to put forward <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/news/2024/04/changes-to-the-start-up-visa-and-self-employed-persons-programs-to-help-reduce-backlogs-and-improve-processing-times.html" target="_blank"><strong>10 applicants per year</strong></a>, essentially limiting the number of commitment certificates they can issue per year.</li>
<li>You can find definitions of “designated angel investor group”, “designated business incubator”, and “designated venture capital fund” on the <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/services/immigration-citizenship/helpcentre/glossary.html" target="_blank">Glossary</a> of the IRCC website.</li>
<li>One difference is <strong>whose money is invested</strong>. Angel investors are made up of members who invest their own capital in start-ups, usually in exchange for equity. Venture capital funds raise and manage capital from others to place equity investments in start-ups. The two kinds of organizations also offer different kinds of help.</li>
<li><strong>Physical space and facilities</strong>. Angel investors also offer mentorship and networking; these are listed as among the kinds of support that venture capital funds provide. In addition, business incubators may provide “capital”, but while this is not listed among the services that venture capital funds provide, the very point of such funds is to provide capital.</li>
<li><strong>Criteria for Designation</strong>. Under subsection 98.03(2) of the IRPR, the Minister designates business incubators, angel investors, and venture capital funds based on whether:<ul>
<li>the entity is recognized for its expertise in assessing the potential for and assisting in the success of start-up business opportunities in Canada; and</li>
<li>it has the ability to assess the potential for and assist in the success of start-up business opportunities in Canada.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Failure to comply with these conditions by the entities may lead to the suspension or revocation of a designation under subsections 98.03(4) and 98.03(6).</li>
<li><strong>Commitments</strong>. Designated angel investors, business incubators or venture capital funds must enter into “commitments” with an applicant who has started a qualifying business in order for the applicant to be a member of the Start-Up Business Class. The formal requirements in section 98.04 include that:<ul>
<li>A commitment must be <strong>in written or electronic form</strong> and must be provided by the person with the authority to bind the designated entity.</li>
<li>It must include <strong>information on each applicant</strong> associated with the business.</li>
<li>It must identify the applicant or applicants considered by the designated entity as <strong>essential</strong> to the business.</li>
<li>The designated entity must <strong>not</strong> have charged a fee to review and assess the business proposal or business.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>The <strong>commitment certificate</strong>, along with <strong>a term sheet or client agreement</strong>, must be sent to IRCC by the designated entity. The <strong>letter of support</strong> must be provided by the designated entity to the applicant. The letter must be submitted with the application.</li>
<li>If an essential applicant is identified, there are two consequences:<ul>
<li>First, under subsection 98.08(2), if an essential applicant is <strong>refused</strong> for any reason or withdraws their application, other applicants applying in relation to the same the business will also be <strong>refused</strong> whether or not they meet the other requirements for the class. This was confirmed in <em>Damangir v. Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, <a href="https://www.canlii.org/en/ca/fct/doc/2024/2024fc599/2024fc599.html?resultIndex=1&amp;resultId=bff01525789341aaba33b063e8fe8ed0&amp;searchId=2024-05-24T13:29:52:360/b1187cdba5a84d9f8f2a82c9091ea78b&amp;searchUrlHash=AAAAAQATInN0YXJ0LXVwIGJ1c2luZXNzIgAAAAAB" target="_blank">2024 FC 599</a>.</li>
<li>Second, the essential applicant can apply for a <a href="https://www.canada.ca/en/immigration-refugees-citizenship/services/immigrate-canada/start-visa/work-permits.html#2.0" target="_blank"><strong>work permit</strong></a> to come to Canada to work on the business even <strong>before applying for permanent residence</strong>. The designated entity must support the application for a work permit; specifically, the commitment certificate and the letter of support must indicate that there are “<strong>urgent business reasons for [the essential applicant’s] early entry to Canada.</strong>” Applicants must submit their application for permanent residence before the commitment certificate expires.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>For how long is a commitment certificate valid?<ul>
<li>Answer: According to paragraph 98.01(2)(a), a commitment certificate included in an application for permanent residence under the Start-Up Business Class must be <strong>less than 6 months old</strong>.</li>
<li>The operational instructions further state: Your work permit will only be valid for one year to allow you to begin working in Canada while your application for permanent residence (APR) is being processed. APRs used to be processed within a year, however are currently taking 3 years plus. However, if you need an extension, it will be considered on a case-by-case basis through the normal extension process.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Commitments from the different kinds of Designated Entities:<ul>
<li>“a designated <strong>angel investor</strong> group confirming that it is investing at least <strong>$75,000</strong> in a qualifying business or 2 or more designated angel investor groups confirming that they are together investing a total of at least $75,000 in such a business”</li>
<li>“a designated <strong>venture capital</strong> fund confirming that it is investing at least <strong>$200,000</strong> in a qualifying business or 2 or more designated venture capital funds confirming that they are together investing a total of at least $200,000 in such a business”</li>
<li>“a designated business <strong>incubator</strong> confirming that it is accepting the applicant into its business incubator program.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Requirements of the Commitment Certificate:<ul>
<li>The commitment certificate must be issued <strong>by 1 or more</strong> designated entities.</li>
<li>It must be <strong>less than 6 months old</strong> on the date of application.</li>
<li>It must be issued <strong>without</strong> the designated entity charging a <strong>fee</strong> to review and assess the business proposal or to assess the business.</li>
<li>It must include <strong>a term sheet/client agreement</strong>.</li>
<li>It must include details of the <strong>amount</strong> of the investment and who is investing.</li>
<li>It must include details of the <strong>services</strong> to be provided by the designated entity to the applicant.</li>
<li>It must include details of <strong>any fees</strong> to be charged to the applicant by the designated entity (or other costs/exchange of funds) and when these fees will be collected.</li>
<li>It must include <strong>information</strong> on each applicant (no more than 5 persons may be identified in a commitment to a single business proposal).</li>
<li>It must describe the <strong>relationship</strong> between the applicant and the investment team.</li>
<li>It must describe the <strong>business</strong> and the applicant’s <strong>role</strong> in the business, including the applicant’s title and any tasks the applicant is expected to perform for the company.</li>
<li>It must identify those considered <strong>essential</strong> to the business.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In addition, the instructions sets out specific <strong>requirements for term sheets or client agreement</strong>, depending on whether the designated entity is an angel investor, business incubator, or venture capital fund.</li>

<summary>The Start-Up Business Class: Evaluating Commitments and Substituted Evaluation</summary>
<ul>
<li>subsection <strong>98.08(1)</strong> of the IRPR states:<ul>
<li>If the officer is not satisfied that the entity assessed the applicant and the applicant’s business in a manner consistent with industry standards or is not satisfied that the terms of the commitment are consistent with industry standards, the officer may refuse to issue the permanent resident visa.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>subsection 98.09(1) of the IRPR allows an officer to request that<ul>
<li>a commitment, the applicants and designated entities party to the commitment and the qualifying business to which the commitment relates be <strong>independently assessed by a peer review panel</strong> established under an agreement referred to in section 98.02 by an organization that has expertise with respect to the type of entity making the commitment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>However, under subsection 98.09(4) the officer is <strong>not bound by the review</strong>.</li>
<li>Substituted Evaluation<ul>
<li>section <strong>98.10</strong> of the IRPR provides for a power of <strong>substituted evaluation</strong>:<ul>
<li>An officer may substitute their evaluation of the applicant’s ability to become economically established in Canada for the requirements set out in subsection 98.01(2), if meeting or failing to meet those requirements is not a sufficient indicator of whether the applicant will become economically established in Canada.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>It allows the officer essentially to ove<strong>r</strong>ride the four criteria set out in subsection <strong>98.01(2)</strong> if they conclude those criteria do not reflect the applicant’s actual ability to become economically established in Canada. As with those other provisions, exercise of the power requires the <strong>concurrence</strong> of a second officer (see IRPR, s 98.10(3)).</li>
<li>Substituted evaluation cannot be used overcome an initial failure to obtain a commitment from a designated entity.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details class="note">
<summary>Start-Up Business Class: Legal Research Exercise</summary>
<ul>
<li>According to the Federal Court case law, what seems to be the most <strong>common ground for refusing</strong> applications under the Start-Up Business Class?<ul>
<li>A search for “<strong>start-up business class</strong>” in the Federal Court database on CanLII yielded 20 cases (the search was conducted on May 1, 2024). In 8 cases, the application was refused because the officer concluded that the applicants had embarked on the business and commitment for the <strong>primary purpose</strong> of acquiring a status or privilege under the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA).</li>

<li>During a peer review of the commitment, does the applicant have a right to participate?<ul>

<li>[36]  In my view, the Panel was not required to invite the Applicant to attend the peer review. This process, I repeat, is to examine if Empowered had conducted due diligence in accepting the Applicant’s business proposal, and does not focus on the conduct of the Applicant.</li>

<summary>Self-Employed Persons Class</summary>
<ul>
<li>Foreign nationals who have the intention and ability to be self-employed in Canada and to make a “significant contribution” to either <strong>cultural activities or athletics</strong>.</li>
<li>the Minister has paused intakes for the Self-Employed Persons Class as of <strong>April 30, 2024</strong>.</li>
<li>the regulatory scheme for the Self-Employed Persons Class has two parts:<ul>
<li>A minimum eligibility requirement, namely that a foreign national fall within the definition of “self-employed person” in <strong>subsection 88(1)</strong>, and</li>
<li>The ability to become economically established in Canada, which is determined according to a points system set out in <strong>sections 102 to 105</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>subsection 88(1) of the IRPR states:<ul>
<li>self-employed person means a foreign national who has relevant <strong>experience</strong> and has the <strong>intention</strong> and <strong>ability</strong> to be self-employed in Canada and to make a significant <strong>contribution</strong> to specified <strong>economic activities</strong> in Canada.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>In <em>Zhang v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, <a href="http://canlii.ca/t/j0ss1" target="_blank">2019 FC 764</a>, Madam Justice Walker wrote that this definition has three requirements:<ul>
<li>relevant <strong>experience</strong>;</li>
<li>the <strong>intention and ability</strong> to be self-employed in Canada; and</li>
<li>the intention and ability to make a significant <strong>contribution</strong> to specified economic activities in Canada.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>If a worker operates with <strong>significant autonomy</strong>, takes on the risk of <strong>loss</strong> and the opportunity to <strong>profit</strong>, and <strong>hires</strong> people to assist them, they are likely to be considered self-employed.</li>
<li>relevant experience, in respect of<ul>
<li>(a) a self-employed person, other than a self-employed person selected by a province, means a minimum of <strong>two</strong> years of experience, during the period beginning <strong>five</strong> years before the date of application for a permanent resident visa and ending on the day a determination is made in respect of the application, consisting of<ul>
<li>(i) in respect of <strong>cultural activities</strong>,<ul>
<li>(A) two one-year periods of experience in self-employment in cultural activities,</li>
<li>(B) two one-year periods of experience in participation at a world class level in cultural activities, or</li>
<li>(C) a combination of a one-year period of experience described in clause (A) and a one-year period of experience described in clause (B),</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(ii) in respect of <strong>athletics</strong>,<ul>
<li>(A) two one-year periods of experience in self-employment in athletics,</li>
<li>(B) two one-year periods of experience in participation at a world class level in athletics, or</li>
<li>(C) a combination of a one-year period of experience described in clause (A) and a one-year period of experience described in clause (B), and</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>(iii) in respect of the purchase and management of a farm, two one-year periods of experience in the management of a farm; and</li>

<li>Self-employed experience in cultural activities or athletics will capture those traditionally applying in this category, for example, <strong>music teachers, painters, illustrators, film makers, freelance journalists</strong>. Beyond that, the category is intended to capture those people who work behind the scenes as a self-employed person, for example, <strong>choreographers, set designers, coaches and trainers</strong>.</li>
<li>Participation at a world-class level in cultural activities or athletics intends to capture performers. This describes those who perform in the arts, and in the world of sport. “World class” identifies persons who are known internationally. It also identifies persons who <strong>may not be known internationally but perform at the highest levels in their discipline</strong>.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Intention and Ability to be Self-Employed in Canada. The operational instructions states the following:<ul>
<li>(1) <strong>sufficient funds</strong> to launch their self-employment and support themselves and their family members; and</li>
<li>(2) a demonstrated <strong>past ability</strong> to support themselves and their family members through their talents.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“specific economic activities” of the Self-Employed Persons will be cultural activities, athletics, or the purchase and management of a farm.</li>
<li>Significant Contribution". The operational instructions state the following:<ul>
<li>It is intended that the Self-Employed Persons Class enrich Canadian culture and sports. In other words, when applicants meet the test of experience and there is a reasonable expectation they will be self-employed, the test of significant contribution becomes relative. For example, a music teacher destined to a small town can be considered significant at the local level. Likewise, a freelance journalist who contributes to a Canadian publication will meet the test.</li>

<summary>Self-Employed Persons Class: Selection Criteria</summary>
<ul>
<li>the Self-Employed Persons Class is defined in subsection 100(1) IRPR as a class of persons<ul>
<li>who may become permanent residents on the basis of their ability to become economically established in Canada and</li>
<li>who are self-employed persons within the meaning of subsection 88(1).</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Subsection <strong>102(1)</strong> sets out the five factors to be assessed in order to determine if a foreign national and their family members will be able to become economically established in Canada:<ul>
<li><strong>age</strong>, for up to 10 points;</li>
<li><strong>education</strong>, for up to 25 points;</li>
<li><strong>proficiency</strong> in the official languages of Canada, for up to 24 points;</li>
<li><strong>experience</strong>, for up to 35 points; and</li>
<li><strong>adaptability</strong>, for up to 6 points.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>108(1)(a) of the IRPR in turn states that applicants must receive the minimum number of points set by the Minister. The current minimum number of points that has been set is <strong>35</strong>.</li>
<li>Section 109 of the IRPR sets out a power of <strong>substituted evaluation</strong>.</li>

<ul>
<li><em>Zhang v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, <a href="http://canlii.ca/t/j0ss1" target="_blank">2019 FC 764</a><ul>
<li>The applicant's annual income, benefits, the length of his time on contract with the school, and the fact that he did not coach players outside the school were indicative of an employment relationship.</li>
<li>Madam Justice Walker states that the definition of relevant experience “requires a foreign national to establish participation at a world class level in athletics during the relevant period. It does <strong>not require</strong> the foreign national to establish <strong>participation as a world class athlete</strong> during that period.”</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Wei v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, <a href="http://canlii.ca/t/j1n5n" target="_blank">2019 FC 982</a><ul>
<li>At paragraph 33, Justice Annis writes that “to make a significant contribution to Canadian culture, unless otherwise essential, it should not involve Chinese actors from China, or recourse to the Applicant's Chinese facilities in China to support filmmaking. In order to contribute significantly to the Canadian cultural economic scene, <strong>all aspects of the production of the films should occur to the greatest extent possible in Canada</strong>.”</li>
<li>How can one establish an <strong>ability</strong> to make a significant contribution to specified economic activities in Canada? By demonstrating “the possession of the means to be able and to execute the project” (¶34)</li>
<li>How can one establish an <strong>intent</strong> to make a significant contribution to specified economic activities in Canada? See paragraph 43: “[T]he test in section 88(1) of the IRPR for what might be described as “commitment or promised intention”, in combination with considering the applicable experience and ability factors, would require an applicant to persuasively demonstrate <strong>past effort and commitment</strong> of sufficient weight such that the officer may conclude that the applicant has demonstrated that he or she will likely proceed as a self-employed person after obtaining permanent resident status to implement the project, which will make a significant contribution to the specified cultural activity in Canada. Under normal circumstances, this will require a demonstration of significant <strong>pre-application efforts</strong> taken with a view to advancing a well-conceived, researched and executed project that indicates a serious possibility of economic success, such that it is unlikely that the applicant would not proceed with the project so long as permanent residency is obtained to enable this to happen under normal circumstances.”</li>
<li>Five problems and advices:<ul>
<li><strong>Minimal role in production of film</strong>: Provide detailed information of his role and responsibilities in past projects similar to those proposed to be undertaken in Canada.</li>
<li><strong>Lack of detailed information on new project, including lack of budget</strong>: Provide as much detail as possible for proposed venture as self-employed person in Canada, including timelines, budgets, who will be hired and how, and so on.</li>
<li><strong>All workers and actors from China</strong>: Set out concrete plans to hire Canadian workers and collaborate with Canadian businesses. Include budgets and, to the extent possible, proof of contact with proposed collaborators.</li>
<li><strong>Failure to disclose past conviction for bribery</strong>: Disclose any past convictions, or other issues that may raise concerns about inadmissibility.</li>
<li><strong>Failure to show that permanent residence is necessary for the success of the project</strong>: Set out concrete plans to hire Canadian workers and collaborate with Canadian businesses. Include budgets and, to the extent possible, proof of contact with proposed collaborators.</li>
