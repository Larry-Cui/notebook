<ul>
<li><strong>Case 1: Discussion Questions</strong><ul>
<li>Groups 1 &amp; 2: Assuming that Jacques may be unable to come to Canada due to his inadmissibility, consider the impacts on (1) the company and (2) Carly. In light of these, what office procedures might Carly adopt to reduce the possibility of being in this situation in the future?<ul>
<li>improve questionnaire.</li>
<li>add a clause to the service agreement outlining what happens if there is an admissibility issue.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Groups 3 &amp; 4: Using the definition of “conflict of interest” in section 1(2) of the Code, would you say that Carly’s situation, at the point where she pulls out the Code, amounts to an actual conflict of interest or a potential conflict of interest?  Explain. What is her immediate next step and why? Your answer should include who her clients are, and what role confidentiality plays in this scenario.<ul>
<li>regardless of who is paying, the work permit is between Jacques and Carly.</li>
<li>Yes. a conflict of interest. the new information may change the company's strategy. company might want to know more, while Jacques might not want to disclose.</li>
<li>avoid conflict. honesty, candour. timely and effective communication.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Groups 5 &amp; 6: Sections 5, 6, 15(1), and 28(3) of the Code all bear on this scenario. Carly's plan will necessarily depend on whether Jacques is willing to disclose this offence to the company. Either way (if Jacques will not disclose; if Jacques will disclose) can you devise a plan in each case for Carly that would fulfill her duties to both parties?  Be specific.<ul>
<li>withdraw if Jacques refused to disclose.</li>
<li>tell the company client everything.</li>
<li>disclose no more than necessary s 28(3)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><strong>Case 2: Family Involvement</strong><ul>
<li>Groups 1 &amp; 2: At the time when Samesh first retained Raj, did Raj have an actual conflict of interest? Was there a potential conflict of interest? Explain your answer with reference to the facts and the definition of “conflict of interest” in section 1(2) of the Code.<ul>
<li>first time: no actual conflict of interest, but potential.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Groups 3 &amp; 4: Using the definition of “conflict of interest” in section 1(2) of the Code, describe the nature of the conflict of interest that Raj now has on this file after Devinder fired Samesh. Your answer should take into account the status of Raj and Devinder under the Code and Raj's Code obligations.<ul>
<li>client: Samesh</li>
<li>third-party payee: not a client</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Groups 5 &amp; 6: A client in this situation may desperately want Raj to continue - they may not know anyone else and have no income to hire someone. Considering ss 15(1) and 15(2), is this a situation where Raj could have Samesh consent in writing for Raj continue to be his Representative despite the conflict of loyalties Raj faces between the interests of Samesh and Devinder? Explain your answer.<ul>
<li>must terminate service agreement.</li>
<li>written consent would not likely be effective.</li>
<li><strong>perceived conflict of interest EXISTS</strong>.</li>

<li>A conflict of interest is a situation in which <strong>your duty of loyalty to the client</strong> or the representation of the client can be <strong>adversely affected by</strong>:<ul>
<li>your own interests, or</li>
<li>your duties to another client (a current, former or joint client) or</li>
<li>the interests of a third party such as a family member of your client</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Even a <strong>perceived conflict</strong> is sufficient to impede the relationship and violate your duties under the Code of Professional Conduct.</li>

<li>According to IRCC’s guidelines for submitting a Family Class sponsorship application, an application is considered to be “made” at the time IRCC receives the complete application. The age of the dependent child is therefore <strong>“locked-in” when IRCC receives an application</strong>. (para 32)</li>
<li>However, where the incompetence or negligence of the applicant’s representative is sufficiently specific and clearly supported by the evidence <strong>such negligence or incompetence is inherently prejudicial to the applicant and will warrant overturning the decision</strong>, notwithstanding the lack of bad faith or absence of a failure to do anything on the part of the tribunal. (para 39)</li>
<li>The Applicant contends that by continuing to act for the Applicant in the appeal before the IAD, the Consultant placed himself in a <strong>conflict of interest</strong> with the Applicant. The Applicant argues that the <strong>Consultant’s self-interest</strong> was to not admit any error on his part and continue to make un-meritorious arguments, while the <strong>Applicant’s interest</strong> was to explain that she suffered a miscarriage of justice due to the Consultant’s error.

<li><strong>JOINT RETAINER AGREEMENTS:</strong> The relevant provisions affecting joint clients can be found in sections 6.1 through 6.4 of the Retainer Agreement Regulation as follows:<ul>
<li>6.1 Before agreeing to represent more than one Client in a matter, a Licensee shall advise the Clients that: (a) Clients being simultaneously represented by a Licensee on a common matter should agree that the Licensee may <strong>share information</strong> among all Clients as required; and (b) if a <strong>conflict</strong> between Clients develops and cannot be resolved, the Licensee cannot continue to represent all Clients, and may have to <strong>withdraw as the Client’s representative for one or all Clients</strong>.</li>
<li>6.2 If a Licensee has a continuing relationship with one Client for whom they act regularly before agreeing to act for that Client and another Client in a matter, the Licensee shall advise the other Client of the <strong>continuing relationship</strong>.</li>
<li>6.3 Although all parties concerned may consent, a Licensee shall avoid acting for more than one Client if it is likely that <strong>an issue contentious</strong> between them will arise or their interests, rights, or obligations will diverge as the matter progresses.</li>
<li>6.4 Where there is more than one Client, <strong>both Clients must date and sign</strong> the Joint Retainer Agreement</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><em>Code</em>:<ul>
<li><strong>Section 1(2)(a)</strong> – Defines the conflict of interest where your own private interests or a third party’s interests (such as your spouse, friend or business partner) conflict with your client’s interests</li>
<li><strong>Section 1(2)(b)</strong> – Defines the conflict of interest where the interests of another client or former client conflict with the interests of an existing client</li>
<li><strong>Section 5</strong> – The duty of loyalty includes the duty to avoid conflicts of interest [as defined in s 1(2)]</li>
<li><strong>Section 15(1)</strong> – Main rule regarding conflicts of interest: Not provide services in cases of actual or potential conflicts ("would or could result in a conflict of interest") unless....</li>

<li><strong>Section 15(1)</strong> – “Subject to sections 16 to 18” means that the rules in sections 16, 17 or 18 will take precedence where they apply; in other words, the disclosure and written consent referred to in section 15(1) will not suffice in the situations described in sections 16, 17 or 18, as more rules apply</li>
<li><strong>Section 15(2)(a)</strong> – Disclosure and written consent will also not suffice where a reasonable person would think you could not be objective regarding your client’s interest, or develop the necessary trust with the client</li>
<li><strong>Section 15(2)(b)</strong> – Disclosure and written consent will not suffice where a reasonable person would think you would necessarily have to compromise the confidentiality of any client or former client</li>
<li>Section 16 – Unauthorized behaviours – the situations in 16(1)(a), (b) and (c) are deemed to be conflicts of interest, and cannot be consented to by the client with the one exception set out in 16(2)</li>

<p>A conflict of interest can be best described as a conflict of:</p>

<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" checked/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> <strong>loyalties</strong><blockquote>
<p>Correct. Aspects of the duty of loyalty include the commitment to the client's cause, honesty and candour as well as confidentiality.  The rules protect all these duties from impairment due to conflicting interests.  See section 5.</p>

<p>A start-up visa is a unique visa available to innovative companies, usually in the high-tech sector, allowing them to obtain faster work permits to relocate a few key employees simultaneously to start-up a business in Canada.   An immigration consultant wishing to represent three such employees on the same application under this program must consider that this situation:</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> constitutes an actual conflict of interest.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> requires independent legal advice for the 3 applicants.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" checked/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> constitutes a <strong>potential conflict</strong> of interest for the reason that the RCIC has three joint clients on the application.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> requires verbal consent of the 3 applicants.<blockquote>
<p>Correct – joint clients on the same application always give rise to a potential conflict of interest, and their written authorization is required to receive services as joint clients, waiving confidentiality between them</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Some conflicts of interest can be managed and some conflicts are absolutely prohibited.  Which situation below is a conflict of interest that would be absolutely prohibited under the Code?</p>
<ul class="task-list">

<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" checked/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Dating a current client.<blockquote>
<p>Correct. There is an absolute prohibition on this conflict of interest which cannot be consented to by the client – see s 16(1)(c).</p>
</blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>A consultant must avoid situations where their personal interests may come into conflict with a client's interests. This may occur, for example, when the consultant buys into the client's business. Such situations are to be avoided because:</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" checked/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> the consultant's financial interests may impede the duty of loyalty owed to client.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> the client may be vulnerable.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> they are strictly prohibited under the Code.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> all of the above.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Under the Code of Professional Conduct, different types of conflicts of interest must be managed in different ways. Some conflicts can be managed with full disclosure and informed consent. Other types of conflicts require the client to obtain independent advice first, which must be confirmed in writing to the RCIC. In applying the Code, which of these situations would require the client to get independent advice?</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> The client is a foreign student asking you to apply for her study permit after you recruited her for Brenton College where you work as an education agent.</li>

<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> You obtained an LMIA for an employer and the worker wants you to represent him on the work permit.<blockquote>
<p>Correct as per s 16(1)(b) and 16(2) as this is an additional transaction which you cannot undertake indirectly (ie through your spouse) unless the terms are fair and reasonable and the client obtains independent advice on the transaction.</p>

<p>Jaspreet focusses her RCIC practice on recruiting foreign students from the Punjab in India.  She is not officially an education agent for any college or university but helps potential students to find the right education institution and program of study in any part of Canada that best suits their needs.  Once a program is identified, Jaspreet helps them with the forms and process to enroll in the specific program.  If they receive an acceptance letter for the program of study, Jaspreet represents them to apply for a  study permit.  She charges $800 for the services up until the student receives an acceptance letter from the school, and $2000 for the study permit.  Under section 18 of the Code, is this practice permissible?</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Yes, provided she is transparent with the student in the service agreement.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Yes, as long as she keeps the fees fair and reasonable.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> No, as finding a school and assisting with enrollment is outside her scope of licence.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" checked/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> No, as she is not allowed to charge for finding a school and enrollment.<blockquote>

<p>Oluwapelelumi (“Olu”) is an RCIC in Moncton, New Brunswick who brings in foreign workers to the Atlantic region in the health care sector. Triston Health Solutions hired her to obtain a Labour Market Impact Assessment (LMIA) for ten long-term care workers.  There were numerous problems along the way, but Olu has finally filed the LMIA application with Service Canada. The company has now contacted Olu to say they waited until their LMIA was filed to save time but are very unhappy with her services. They wish to cancel the service agreement with Olu. They have already found a lawyer across town and want their file transferred to her.  Plus, they do not want to pay the $2000 still owing.  In this situation, Olu should:</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> require the outstanding payment be made before she will transfer the file.</li>

<p>As a consultant, you should avoid situations where your private interests will likely come into conflict with a client's interests. Examples include investing in the client's business, hiring the client as staff, or arranging with a relative to employ your client. These relationships are problematic because:</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" checked/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> you are wearing two hats, which divides your loyalties.</li>

<p>Your firm has just been retained for a Start-Up Visa application by a robotics company.  Three business partners from Germany are seeking work permits to start up their company in Canada, and you will be handling this for them.  Their company manufactures a unique device which can turn over a bed-ridden hospital patient safely using an electro-mechanical device.  It avoids heavy lifting by nurses and has huge market potential.   A representative from a British company contacts your firm to request a consultation about applying for a start-up visa for a hospital device to turn over patients. In this situation, your firm should:</p>

<p>When an immigration consultant advises someone incorrectly, and the client relies on that advice to their detriment, there can be serious consequences for the RCIC as well as the client. Justyna advised her client Kuldeep that he could obtain his new work permit at the border. But Kuldeep was out of status and was not eligible for a work permit at the border.  Instead, the border officer issued Kuldeep an Exclusion Order banning him from Canada for one year since he was out of status. Kuldeep sought advice from a lawyer about <strong>whether he could sue Justyna in civil court for compensation</strong> to recover his losses and obtain damages. The answer is:</p>

<p>Maryam represents Vijay and his spouse Leesa on their spousal sponsorship application. Each spouse has signed Maryam’s service agreement. During the process of preparing the file, Vijay disclosed to Maryam privately that he had just been diagnosed with liver cancer but does not want Leesa to know this yet – he might tell her later, when he is ready. He has not decided yet. This situation requires Maryam to:</p>

<p>the conflict is still <strong>potential</strong>, not actual, and may be resolved if Vijay tells Leesa now. Maryam should explain to him why this is necessary if she is to continue to represent them both.  Mandatory withdrawal under 35(1)(c) is only required when the conflict cannot be resolved.</p>

<p>Haining Wu is a student in the GDipICL Program at Queen’s University hoping to become licensed as an immigration consultant in the future. She is studying the Code of Professional Conduct regarding requirements to maintain client confidentiality under section 28 of the Code. Haining tells the class she has seen various ads and videos on Tik Tok and other Chinese social media where RCICs are talking about their successful cases. For example, one RCIC posted a video about a difficult study permit he was able to obtain for a client. He included several facts such as the client’s name, age, education, country, etc. Haining asked her classmates if this would be a breach of confidentiality. The most correct response would be:</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" checked/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> It is not a breach of confidentiality if the RCIC obtained either <strong>written or verbal consent from the client</strong>.</li>

<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Because a client cannot consent to have their information made public on social media, it would always be a breach of confidentiality.</li>

<p>Banto agreed to assist his fellow RCIC Aboake when Aboake took a brief medical leave. Banto agreed to handle any urgent matters for free. One client, Maria, consented to this, despite having to travel across town to see Banto, because her matter was urgent and she wanted Aboake to remain her representative.  Banto prepared the updated forms as requested by IRCC, had Maria sign them, collected evidence and wrote a submission letter to address the officer's concerns, and sent the package on Aboake’s behalf to Canada Immigration.  There was no service agreement and Aboake did not see the package.  Banto’s professional relationship to Maria is:</p>

<p>There are many acronyms used in the field of immigration. A good example is the acronym “IRPA” which those working in this field recognize as the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act. Similarly, many agencies working in the immigration and refugee sector are also known by their acronyms.

Which of these acronyms stand for agencies that currently have a direct role in the regulation of immigration consultants?</p>

Sahani’s template will leave fields for the name and contact information of the potential client. There will be a signature line at the bottom with the date for Sahani and the client to sign. She plans to charge $250 for an Initial Consultation.
