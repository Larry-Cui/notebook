<p><strong>Doug</strong> married <strong>Felicia</strong>, his high school sweetheart, in their hometown of Victoria, British Columbia on June 22, 2014, but the couple has been living separate and apart since September 21, 2017. Under the terms of their separation agreement, they share joint custody of their nine-year-old daughter, <strong>Mia</strong>, and Doug makes monthly child support payments. In early 2018, Doug accepted a contract to work for a Canadian company in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia, where he began a relationship with <strong>Yau</strong>, and the two have lived together since <strong>May 2, 2018</strong>.

<ul class="task-list">

<p>Doug can sponsor Yau as a common law partner because they have been cohabiting in a conjugal relationship for more than one year. The sponsorship bar under IRPR r 130(3) does not apply to Doug because he was not initially a sponsored spouse, and their relationship is not excluded under IRPR r 117(9). </p>
<p>The fact that Doug and Felicia are still married does not bar him from sponsoring Yau <strong>since they have lived separate and apart for more than one year</strong> (reference: IRCC Assessing a common law relationship).</p>

He shares his office with a friend <strong>Larry</strong>, who is a real estate agent, to save on rent and other overhead expenditures. They also share an open reception area to greet their clients. Which of the following is the most correct method for Albert to keep his clients' files organized and safe?</p>

<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Labelling his files utilizing an alphabetical method and storing them in a file cabinet located in his office.<blockquote>
<p>The Client File Management Regulations require members to employ <strong>a clear and coherent system to label and identify client property</strong>. Albert can utilize a numerical labeling method to organize his clients' files. Furthermore, storing his clients' files in a fireproof locked filing cabinet complies with the requirement to <strong>store client records in a physically secure manner</strong> as outlined in s 6.1 of the Client File Management Regulation. </p>
<p>Labeling his files by date organized in chronological order in a locked file cabinet: this answer is incorrect. Labeling his clients' files by date only is not sufficient to clearly identify clients' property. Members are also required to store active files separately from closed files per s 5.4 of the Client File Management Regulations. </p>
<p>Labeling his files utilizing an alphabetical method and storing them in banker boxes at the reception area: this answer is incorrect. Storing clients' files in banker boxes at the reception is not secure, as such area is open to the public and as a result is contrary to s 6.1 of the Client File Management Regulation. </p>
<p>Labeling his files utilizing an alphabetical method and storing them in a file cabinet located in his office: this answer is incorrect. An unlocked file cabinet that is not fireproof is not secure, contrary to the criteria outlined in s 6.1 of the Client File Management Regulation.</p>

<p><strong>Adel</strong>, a chemical engineer, became a permanent resident <strong>six years ago</strong>. He hopes to obtain Canadian citizenship, but has needed to divide his time between Canada and his home country of Nigeria. The reason is that his employer, a Canadian oil company, moves him between Fort McMurray and Nigeria on three-month rotations. He spends three months in Canada, then three months in Nigeria.

<p><strong>Jay Pham</strong>, 52, has been a naturalized citizen of Canada for many years, operating a successful Vietnamese restaurant in Edmonton. His wife immigrated with him 20 years ago, but they are now divorced. He recently got re-married to <strong>Mai</strong>, a 22-year-old citizen of Vietnam who he met through her relatives in Edmonton. Jay travelled to Vietnam for the wedding and a second time to visit her. He occasionally sends money for her support. After interviewing Mai, the visa officer found the marriage was not genuine, but was entered into solely to gain immigration status in Canada. Jay has filed an appeal to the IAD. While waiting for the appeal hearing, Mai gives birth to their child. </p>

<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> No, because the matter involves a possible fraudulent marriage, so the birth is not relevant.<blockquote>
<p>An IAD hearing is an appeal <strong><em>de novo</em></strong>, meaning that the facts and law will be re-considered and assessed at the time the appeal is disposed of; thus, new evidence is admissible. This is the opposite of the rule for judicial review in Federal Court, where only evidence that was before the officer when the decision was made can be considered by the court. As the appellant has a right to prove the facts as they exist at the time of the hearing, he can introduce any new evidence that arose after the officer's refusal. He need not rely on the panel member's discretion in this regard. A baby is very relevant to genuineness of a marriage and would be a significant, although not determinative, factor.

Reference: <em>Kehn v Canada (Minister of Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, 2020 FC 615.

If your client does not remember something, it's best to say that she does not remember or refer the RPD to her BOC or another corroborating document.</p>

<p><strong>Yuling</strong> is a citizen of China and of no other country. Yuling is 44 years old and has a 17-year-old daughter, <strong>Mei</strong>. In 2011, Yuling began practicing Falun Gong, and over the course of several years, Yuling and Mei received numerous threats from authorities as a result of her spiritual practice. Last year, Yuling and other Falun Gong practitioners led a small protest against the government. Yuling was detained at the protest and sent to a forced labour camp. After six months of being in detention, Yuling managed to escape the labour camp. In her escape, she injured a security guard and left him paralyzed. Fearing for her and Mei's safety, she decided to flee the country with her daughter. She quickly sought out the help of a smuggler to assist them in obtaining false documents and arranging transit to Canada. After a difficult and roundabout journey, Yuling and Mei arrived at the Toronto airport with several other Chinese citizens who were also seeking asylum. Upon arrival, Yuling, Mei, and the others were <strong>designated as irregular arrivals</strong>. </p>

<p>Exclusion based on Article 1F(b) is correct. A refugee claimant will be excluded under <strong>Article 1F(b)</strong> and IRPA s 98 if it is determined that she committed a <strong>serious non-political crime</strong> outside the country of refuge. There is a presumption of "seriousness" if the crime involves wounding, homicide, etc. (see Febles). In assessing the seriousness of the crime, the RPD also has to evaluate the facts, any mitigating/aggravating circumstances, etc. (see Jayasekara). Here the RPD would have to determine if the crime was serious and if it was non-political (see Febles for "non-political" test). See also: IRB. </p>
<p>It is not correct that the availability of state protection is likely to be raised by the RPD. In Yuling's case, the state is the persecutory agent and therefore state protection is not available. </p>
<p>It is not necessary to demonstrate that Yuling tried to obtain state protection since it would not have been reasonably forthcoming. Yuling and Mei's fear of persecution is by reason of membership in a particular social group (1 of 5 Convention grounds). </p>
<p>A person who has claimed refugee protection may not be charged for possessing and using a fraudulent document to enter Canada (IRPA s 122, 133).</p>

<p><strong>Javier</strong> made a claim for protection in Canada but was found inadmissible because he had previously been convicted of drug trafficking (the equivalent of an indictable offence in Canada, punishable by imprisonment for up to ten years) in his native country of Colombia. After a removal order was issued against him, Javier retained <strong>Steven</strong>, an RCIC, to advise him on whether he can apply for PRRA. Javier tells Steven that he was coerced into the drug trade by criminal gangs who threatened his family, and that he never wanted to be part of it. He fled to Canada to escape because police in his country have not been able to protect the community, and he fears that the gang will kill him if he is returned to Colombia. </p>

<p><strong>Caleb</strong> is an RCIC in Winnipeg, Manitoba who has been retained by <strong>Karim</strong> to assist in a family sponsorship application for his wife, <strong>Amandeep</strong>. After Karim received a letter rejecting his application on the basis that Amandeep was inadmissible, Caleb represented him in an appeal before the Immigration Appeal Division. Unfortunately, on <strong>September 12, 2024</strong>, the IAD upheld the IRCC officer's decision to reject the application. Karim tells Caleb that he wants to further appeal the decision because he feels that the IRCC officer did not adequately take into account his ability to pay for treatment for his wife's ongoing medical condition. Karim tells Caleb that he wants to apply for judicial review of the officer's decision. </p>
<p>In these circumstances, Caleb must advise Karim that:</p>
<ul class="task-list">

<p>A person can apply for judicial review for any determination made under the IRPA provided that any right of appeal under the IRPA is exhausted.

<p class="admonition-title">Case</p>
<p><strong>Trish</strong> is a citizen of Bangladesh and of no other country. In her home country, Trish experienced harassment, threats, and physical violence because she is a transgender woman. She was kicked out of her home and was sexually assaulted by police when she attempted to seek protection. Trish suffers from post-traumatic stress disorder as a result of the violence she experienced and has difficulty remembering certain events and dates. Trish consults <strong>Rafi</strong>, an RCIC, who assists her in filing a refugee claim. They decide that no witnesses will be called to testify. Trish's application is processed, and her claim is deemed eligible to be referred to the RPD for a hearing. Trish is understandably nervous about the RPD hearing and asks Rafi what the process entails. </p>

<p>The correct order is as follows: </p>
<p>Trish will take a solemn <strong>affirmation</strong>, Trish will <strong>testify</strong>, Rafi will make <strong>comments</strong> about her case, and the RPD member will render an oral <strong>decision</strong> at the hearing or send a written decision by mail. See IRCC Claimant's Guide. </p>
<p>The RPD renders an oral decision at the conclusion of the hearing, unless it is not possible to do so. If that's the case, the decision and reasons will be sent by mail.</p>

<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> There is a presumption that the facts Trish provides in her sworn testimony are true, unless there is a valid reason to doubt their truthfulness.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Omissions and/or inconsistencies in Trish's testimony have to be serious and relevant to the claim for them to negatively impact Trish's credibility.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" checked/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> In assessing Trish's credibility, the RPD can evaluate her general demeanour, with an emphasis on her physical appearance.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> In assessing Trish's demeanour, the RPD should take into account Trish's psychological condition and vulnerable circumstances.<blockquote>
<p>The RPD can evaluate the claimant's demeanour in assessing the credibility of the evidence. <strong>The RPD ought not to form impressions based on physical appearance but rather on objective considerations.</strong> </p>
<p>The Court of Appeal, in <strong><em>Maldonado</em></strong>, and on several other occasions, set out the important principle that when a claimant swears that certain facts are true, this creates a presumption that they are true, unless there is valid reason to doubt their truthfulness. See IRB, Assessment of Credibility in Claims for Refugee Protection, s 2.3.2. </p>
<p>The existence of contradictions or inconsistencies in the evidence of a claimant is a well-accepted basis for a finding of lack of credibility. However, the discrepancies must be sufficiently serious and must concern matters that are relevant to the issues being adjudicated to warrant the adverse finding. See IRB, Assessment of Credibility in Claims for Refugee Protection, s 2.2.3 and IRB, Assessment of Credibility in Claims for Refugee Protection, s 2.3.4. </p>
<p>The claimant's psychological condition arising out of traumatic past experiences may have an impact on her ability to testify. The RPD should take into account the claimant's psychological condition and vulnerable circumstances. See IRB, Assessment of Credibility in Claims for Refugee Protection, s 2.5.</p>

<p><strong>Kiki</strong> is a 22-year-old citizen of Belgium. Her native language is French, and although she has not taken a language test, she is fluent in English. After graduating from secondary school, she moved to Paris and completed a three-year bachelor's degree in baking and pastry arts at a well-regarded culinary school. During her program, she accumulated eight months' experience as an apprentice at a boulangerie, where she prepared breads and viennoiseries, and she continued to work at the boulangerie full-time for another twelve months after graduating. Kiki enjoyed the experience of moving to a new country for her studies, and she has been thinking of looking for a permanent job elsewhere in Europe or in North America in order to settle somewhere new. She has saved €10,500 (approximately CDN$15,500) in preparation for her move. Kiki's cousin, Geoff, is a Canadian citizen who lives in Regina, Saskatchewan, and he has offered to let her stay with him and his family if she would be interested in moving to Canada. </p>
<p>Does Kiki have enough points to qualify for the Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program International Skilled Worker: Occupation in Demand category?</p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" checked/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> No, but she will have enough points if she takes an approved <strong>language test</strong>.</li>

<p>Kiki currently scores 54 points out of 100 on the Saskatchewan International Skilled Worker Points Assessment Grid (20 + 2 + 12 + 20 = 54), and she is required to score 60 points out of 100. Reference: SINP ( Saskatchewan Immigrant Nominee Program (SINP)) Education (bachelor's degree): 20 Skilled work experience (one year in the five-year period prior to her application submission date): 2 Language ability (English or French speaker without language test results): 0 Age (22-34 years): 12 Close family relative in Saskatchewan (first cousin): 20 Because Kiki is fluent in English and French, she can obtain another 20 points by taking an approved language test for a total of 74 points, exceeding the required 60. Kiki's savings exceed the program's requirements. Reference: SINP ( SINP, IRCC). The occupation-in-demand category requires applicants to have education and work experience in a TEER 0, 1, 2, or 3 occupation. Kiki's occupation (baker) is a TEER 3 occupation (requiring college education or apprenticeship training of less than two years). Additionally, her occupation is not on the list of excluded occupations. (References: SINP 1, SINP 2).</p>
