<ul>
<li>The strength of a sponsorship application or an appeal before the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD) often comes down to the <strong>evidence</strong> that was included in the initial application or submitted in support of an appeal.</li>
<li>In Module 4, you will learn about the quality and type of evidence needed to establish the <strong>genuineness</strong> of a spousal relationship in a sponsorship appeal hearing before the Immigration Appeal Division (IAD).</li>
<li>From low to high standard of proof:<ul>
<li>Reasonable ground to believe:<ul>
<li>A33: The facts that constitute inadmissibility under sections <strong>34 to 37</strong> include facts arising from omissions and, unless otherwise provided, include facts for which there are <strong>reasonable grounds to believe</strong> that they have occurred, are occurring or may occur.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>“Balance of probabilities,” or “more likely than not”<ul>
<li>In most appeals, the <strong>IAD</strong> applies this standard of proof to the evidence and to the final determination.</li>
<li>The <strong>RPD</strong> and the <strong>RAD</strong> to prove that your client is at risk of torture or other cruel and unusual treatment of punishment pursuant to section <strong>97</strong> of the IRPA (easy to stay)</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Serious possibility<ul>
<li>The <strong>RPD</strong> and the <strong>RAD</strong> apply this standard for assessments of a well-founded fear of persecution under section <strong>96</strong> of the IRPA. (hard to claim as a refugee)</li>

<summary>Q&amp;A with a former IRB Member</summary>
<ol>
<li>
<p>When an IRB member says they are "weighing the evidence", what exactly does this mean?</p>
<ul>
<li>It means that they are considering the evidence that is before them and applying to it the appropriate significance in their decision based on the <strong>quality</strong> of the evidence and the <strong>relevance</strong> to the decision they need to make.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>Is all evidence in an IRB proceeding equally relevant?</p>
<ul>
<li>No. Relevance is determined based on the degree to which the evidence is applicable to the issues that must be decided by the member. Evidence will likely be seen as more relevant, the stronger the nexus between that evidence and the issues that must be decided. For example, if an issue is whether or not the applicant is in a genuine marital relationship with their spouse, a DNA test showing that they have a child together is likely to be highly relevant. In contrast, a letter from a family friend discussing how lovely the applicant is, is likely to be deemed less relevant because it does not support or negate the key issue in the case.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the primary considerations of an IRB member when assessing evidence in a proceeding?</p>
<ul>
<li>Pursuant to the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act (IRPA), members of the IRB are not bound by the technical rules of evidence and may receive and base a decision on <strong>evidence that is adduced in a proceeding</strong> that is considered credible or trustworthy in the circumstances (see <strong>s 170</strong> of the IRPA). As a result, members of the IRB must ensure that the evidence is relevant to the determination that they have to make and they must ensure that the evidence is credible and trustworthy. This includes ensuring that the evidence is coming from a reliable source and is not the product of torture.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What are the hallmarks of "reliable evidence" in an IRB proceeding?</p>
<ul>
<li>What amounts to reliable evidence will <strong>depend on the facts and situation at hand</strong>. For example, research evidence will generally be viewed as reliable if it is recent and from a reputable source and corroborated by other sources. Evidence from witnesses will be assessed based on the witness’s credibility, including the consistency of their testimony and their knowledge and ability to testify about the facts that they are testifying to. Documentary evidence is likely to be assessed based on the source of the document, the nature of the document, and whether it has internal markers of credibility (is it dated, signed, set out as such a document ought to be, etc.), and whether it can be corroborated with, or at least is consistent with, other documentation.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>As counsel for the individual in an IRB proceeding, what arguments assist in showing that more weight should be given to a certain piece of evidence?</p>
<ul>
<li>Establishing that the evidence has the hallmarks of <strong>reliability</strong> are important in demonstrating that the evidence that you bring forward should be given weight. <strong>Set out in your submissions where the evidence came from, and how it is supported by, or consistent with, other evidence that you have provided.</strong> Also set out other markers that would support a finding that it is credible (Is it sworn testimony? Does the evidence come from a particularly reputable or objective source? Is the evidence internally consistent? etc.). Be sure to set out how the evidence that you are putting forward actually supports the factual assertions that you are saying it supports.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>As Minister's counsel in an IRB proceeding, what arguments assist in showing that less weight should be given to a certain piece of evidence?</p>
<ul>
<li>Demonstrating that evidence does not have the hallmarks of <strong>credibility</strong> or reliability will help to ensure that the evidence is given less weight in a proceeding. <strong>Arguments which demonstrate that the evidence is inconsistent with, or not supported by, any other evidence are often useful in demonstrating that the evidence should be given little weight.</strong> Arguments that demonstrate that the evidence is self-serving, not from a reliable source, and does not have other indicators of reliability (e.g., a letter that is unsigned or not dated, receipts that do not have information about what they are for, etc.) also assist in establishing that little weight should be given to the evidence. Finally, pointing out that the evidence being offered <strong>does not actually support the proposition</strong> that it is said to support can also assist in showing that less weight should be given to that evidence.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>How does an individual's credibility impact on the weighing of evidence?</p>
<ul>
<li>Generally the more credible a person’s evidence the more weight it will be given. Similarly the less credible a person’s evidence the less weight their testimony will be given. The caveat here is that in addition to credibility the person’s evidence must be relevant to the decision makers determination to be given weight. For example, a person can testify credibly that the applicant always pays their rent on time. But if the issue at hand is whether the applicant is in a genuine marital relationship with somebody, that credible testimony may not be relevant in which case it won’t be given weight in the member’s assessment.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>When the "burden of proof" rests on the appellant, claimant, or person concerned, what does this mean?</p>
<ul>
<li>The party that has the <strong>burden of proof</strong> is responsible for <strong>leading enough credible and trustworthy evidence to establish their case</strong> on a particular standard of proof. <strong>In a sponsorship appeal hearing</strong>, that standard of proof is <strong>a balance of probabilities</strong> which means that the party with the burden of proof must show that it is more likely than not that their version of events occurred. In such cases, if the member finds that either outcome is equally likely, then the party with the burden of proof would lose as they would not have established their case to the necessary standard.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>
<p>What is the standard of proof that the IAD member applies to <strong>sponsorship appeal</strong> hearings?</p>
<ul>
<li>The standard of proof in a sponsorship appeal hearing is <strong>a balance of probabilities</strong>. That is, the party with the burden of proof has to establish that it is more likely than not (50% + 1) that their version of events occurred.</li>

<p>George is a Canadian citizen who is applying to sponsor his wife Tina who lives in China with their two children. As George is fluent in English and Tina is not, he is the one who completed the application. Tina has a very minimal understanding of English and signs the papers that George sends to her without reading them carefully. When IRCC reviews the application, the officer discovers that there are major inconsistencies between the sponsorship application and a previous application for a temporary residence visa that Tina applied for 2 years ago. The officer determines that Tina is inadmissible on the grounds of misrepresentation under section 40 of the IRPA. Is Tina admissible?</p>
