<summary>Minors - Two options for citizenship applications</summary>
<ul>
<li>Application under s. 5(2). For Minors who are either:<ul>
<li>Applying at the same time as a parent who is applying for a citizenship grant (<strong>concurrent applications</strong>); or</li>
<li>Already have a living parent (natural or adoptive) who is a Canadian citizen (<strong>non-concurrent applications</strong>).</li>
<li>For concurrent applications, the effective date of citizenship for minors under 14 years of age is the date the citizenship officer grants citizenship to the minor (after the parent has taken the Oath of Citizenship).</li>
<li>The effective date of citizenship for minors over 14 years of age, whether concurrent or non-concurrent application, is the date the minor takes and signs the oath of citizenship.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Application under s. 5(1).<ul>
<li><strong>Under s 5 (1), minors can apply in the much the same way as an adult</strong>; they must meet many of the same requirements, including <strong>residency and tax requirements</strong>.</li>
<li>Minors do not have to meet knowledge/language since only apply to those 18 - 54 years old.</li>
<li>The citizenship of a minor must be applied for on behalf of the minor by a person who has custody or allowed to act on their behalf (unless waived by the Minister).</li>
<li>Minors 14 - 17 must also counter-sign (i.e. co-sign) their application and take the Oath of Citizenship.</li>
<li><strong>Residency requirement can also be waived by Minister</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Advantage of <strong>s. 5(2)</strong><ul>
<li>Applications under s 5(2) can be more straightforward as they do not require a residency assessment. <strong>They are based on the parent.</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Advantage of <strong>s. 5(1)</strong><ul>
<li>However, following Bill C-6 (2017), minors can now apply for citizenship without a Canadian parent, as the <strong>age requirement for citizenship has been removed under subsection 5(1)</strong>. Someone who is empowered to act on their behalf can apply for them the same as an adult.</li>
<li>This may be useful in myriad circumstances.</li>
<li>Residency requirements: If the minor has more residence in the Canada than the parents; for example, if they have spent time living with relatives in Canada or in boarding school while parents are abroad.</li>
<li>Criminality: Counsel may also consider this option if there are hurdles to obtaining the parents’ citizenship, such as a prohibition stemming from a prior criminal conviction or an active investigation. In certain circumstances, if minors have applied concurrently with parents under s 5(2) and application is suspended under s 13.1 of the Act because of parent, counsel may consider filing a separate application for the minors under s 5(1).</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details class="note">
<summary>Procedural fairness in the citizenship process</summary>
<ul>
<li>Citizenship officers must allow an interpreter to assist an applicant to understand the procedures and to facilitate communication during an interview, a hearing or any other interaction with the applicant during the citizenship process. (See e.g., <em>Zarandi v. MCI</em>, <a href="https://canlii.ca/t/gl7v9" target="_blank">2015 FC 1036</a>)</li>
<li>It is preferable that an interpreter be accredited, but this is <strong>not legally required</strong>. An interpreter can be a friend, a relative of the applicant, or any other person.</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details class="note">
<summary>Adoptions</summary>
<ul>
<li>All of the following requirements must be met in order for an adopted person to be granted Canadian citizenship under subsection <strong>s 5.1(1)</strong> of the Citizenship Act:<ul>
<li>a full adoption must have taken place (for more information, see s. 6 of CP 14)</li>
<li>at least one adoptive parent was a <strong>Canadian citizen</strong> at the time of the adoption</li>
<li>the adopted person must have been <strong>under 18</strong> years of age at the time of the adoption<ul>
<li>Exception to this requirement: Procedures also exist for adoptions that occurred after the person turned 18 pursuant to s. 5.1(2) as long as there was a parent-child relationship before the child turned 18 and the adoption is not being done primarily for immigration purposes. This is for exceptional cases such as for example if a Canadian aunt has raised a niece as her own de facto child for many years abroad, but then decides to move back to Canada after the child turns 18 and must legally adopt her in order to confer them status. Or if they’ve been raising the child for many years and applied for adoption before they turned 18 but it took a numbers of years for the adoption to be finalized in the foreign country, until after the child had already turned 18. </li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>the adoption must have been in the best interests of the child [A5.1(1)(a)]</li>
<li>the adoption must have created a <strong>genuine</strong> parent-child relationship [A5.1(1)(b)]</li>
<li>the adoption must have been in accordance with the laws of the place where the adoption took place and the laws of the country of residence of the adopting citizen [A5.1(1)(c)]</li>
<li>the adoption must not have occurred in a manner that circumvented the legal requirements for international adoptions [A5.1(1)(c.1)]</li>
<li>the adoption was <strong>not entered into primarily for the purpose of acquiring a status or privilege</strong> in relation to immigration or citizenship [A5.1(1)(d)]</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Section <strong>5.1</strong> of the <strong>Citizenship Regulations</strong> lists a number of factors to consider in determining whether the above criteria have been met, including but not limited to:<ul>
<li>where the adoption took place</li>
<li>whether the child lived in a country that was a party to the Hague Convention and if the requirements of that Convention were complied with</li>
<li>whether the province or territory of destination in Canada objects to the adoptions</li>
<li>and if the adoption permanently severed a previous parent-child relationship</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Adoptive parents may also choose to sponsor their adopted children to Canada as PRs under the IRPA.</li>

<summary>Special grants</summary>
<ul>
<li>Subsection <strong>5(4)</strong> of the Citizenship Act allows the Minister, at their discretion, to grant citizenship to any person to alleviate cases of statelessness or of special and unusual hardship or to reward services of an exceptional nature to Canada.​</li>
<li>The Federal Court of Appeal has ruled that an individual is not truly stateless if they have the <strong>possibility</strong> of obtaining citizenship or national status elsewhere:​<ul>
<li>It is true that as a result of the facts described above, the appellant is not recognized as a citizen of any country at the present time. But that is not statelessness in the international law sense…. [A] person is stateless only where…as a legal or practical matter the person cannot get citizenship or national status elsewhere. ​<em>Budlakoti v Canada (Citizenship and Immigration)</em>, <a href="https://canlii.ca/t/gjfcg" target="_blank">2015 FCA 139</a> at para. 23</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Amendments to the Citizenship Act in 2014 and 2015 provide for expedited access to citizenship for persons who are serving or have served in or with the Canadian Armed Forces.​<ul>
<li>Most notably, ss 5(1.2) and 5(1.3) <strong>exempt the physical presence requirement</strong> of paragraph 5(1)(c) if the applicant has <strong>served</strong> in or with the Canadian Armed Forces for <strong>three years (1095 days)</strong> out of the last six-year period, but all other regular requirements apply (language, knowledge, lack of prohibitions etc.)</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details class="note">
<summary>Waivers</summary>
<ul>
<li>Language and knowledge​ requirements<ul>
<li>Pursuant to <strong>s 5(3)(a)</strong> of the Act, a citizenship official may <strong>grant a waiver</strong> to those who demonstrate they are not able to meet the language or knowledge requirements on compassionate grounds. </li>
<li>A compassionate waiver can be issued for <strong>a broad range of personal circumstances</strong> such as having suffered trauma or having low levels of education or literacy in the primary language (mother tongue). </li>
<li>However, waivers are most commonly requested and granted on <strong>medical grounds</strong> for those who have a medical condition that prevents them from meeting the requirements.</li>
<li>In submitting <strong>a medical waiver application</strong> on behalf of an applicant, you must provide:​<ul>
<li><strong>A completed Request for Medical Opinion form</strong> [CIT 0547], which can be provided by IRCC​</li>
<li><strong>A more detailed medical opinion</strong> completed by a physician that details the reasons why an applicant may not be able to meet the language and/or knowledge requirements for citizenship, and specifies whether or not the applicant’s medical condition is permanent or temporary​</li>
<li>All additional supporting <strong>medical records, reports, and evidence</strong></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Evidence offered in support of a fact asserted to be true should be credible and relevant. Provide <strong>additional expert reports</strong>, and <strong>credible research</strong> regarding the applicant’s medical condition, medication, side effects, along with <strong>submissions</strong> with respect to how they impact the applicant's ability to meet the language and/or knowledge requirements. These can be both personal to the applicant and general information regarding their medical condition from credible sources. ​</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Waiver of the Oath​<ul>
<li>Pursuant to <strong>s 5(3)(c)</strong> of the Act, the requirement of taking the Oath of Citizenship may be waived on compassionate grounds if an applicant is prevented from understanding the significance of taking the Oath of Citizenship by reason of <strong>a mental disability</strong>.​</li>
<li>In such cases, the applicant is required to:​<ul>
<li>submit evidence (i.e. <strong>completed medical opinion form and supporting documentation</strong>) of the mental disability; and​</li>
<li>provide evidence of the identity of the legal guardian applying on behalf of the applicant</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Prohibitions​<ul>
<li>Pursuant to <strong>s. 22(1.1)</strong> of the Act, the Minister may, at their discretion, waive the application of paragraph <strong>22(1)(b.1)</strong> on compassionate grounds.</li>
<li>This would waive the prohibitions where the applicant is <strong>currently charged with, on trial for, subject to or party to an appeal</strong> relating to an offence committed <strong>outside</strong> Canada that, if committed in Canada, would constitute an indictable offence under any Act of Parliament.</li>
<li>this applies to charges outside Canada, it does <strong>not apply to foreign convictions</strong>.​</li>
<li>Pursuant to <strong>s. 22(5)</strong> of the Act, the Minister may on compassionate grounds waive the application of subsection <strong>22(4)</strong>, which contains the permanent prohibitions for those who have committed specific “acts against Canada’s national interests” including terrorism, treason and other  similar convictions.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Pursuant to s 5(3)(d) of the Act, the following requirements can be waived on compassionate grounds for <strong>minors</strong>:​<ul>
<li>To have the person who has custody of the minor or is empowered to act on the minor’s behalf submit an application on behalf of a minor [new subparagraph 5(3)(b)(v)]</li>
<li>The residency requirement, which can only be waived for minors – there is no discretion for adults</li>
<li>The taking of the oath of citizenship (minors 14 to 17 years of age) due to mental disability</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>Financial grounds<ul>
<li>In January 2019, the Federal Court issued a consent order in the case of <em>Tammy Lynn Mayes and Justice for Children and Youth v The Minister of Citizenship and Immigration</em>, providing that the Minister may exercise discretion and <strong>waive the applicable citizenship processing fees</strong> to alleviate cases of statelessness or of special and unusual hardship or to reward services of an exceptional value to Canada.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
</details>
<details class="note">
<summary>Indigenous Applicants</summary>
<ul>
<li>First Nations have the right to determine their own criteria for membership, pursuant to s 10 of the <em>Indian Act</em>. The entitlement for those registered under the Indian Act to enter and remain in Canada is confirmed by s 19(1) of IRPA. ​</li>
<li>If such a person wishes to acquire Canadian citizenship, the process is the <strong>same</strong> one that is followed for all permanent residents, with the exception that the residency period is deemed to commence either <strong>upon entering Canada</strong> (if already registered) or on the date the person <strong>became registered</strong> (if not registered when they entered Canada). ​</li>
<li>Importantly, there is <strong>no requirement to apply for permanent residency</strong>. Rather, time spent residing in Canada registered under the Indian Act is counted the same as time spent in Canada as a permanent resident. ​</li>
<li>Additionally, mirroring the residency requirements for permanent residents, any day spent lawfully in Canada <strong>prior to being registered will count as a half-day</strong> toward the residency requirement if falling within the assessment period.</li>
</ul>

<p>Hassan may be eligible under both <strong>s. 5(1.01) and (1.2)</strong> of the Citizenship Act. Goli may be eligible under <strong>s. 5(1.03)</strong>. In full, the relevant provisions provide as follows: </p>
<p>Period of physical presence — permanent residents </p>
<p>(1.02) Any day during which an applicant for citizenship was a permanent resident within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act and was employed outside Canada in or with the <strong>Canadian Armed Forces, the federal public administration or the public service of a province</strong>, otherwise than as a locally engaged person, shall be treated as equivalent to one day of physical presence in Canada for the purposes of paragraphs (1)(c) and 11(1)(d). </p>
<p>Period of physical presence — residing with permanent residents </p>
<p>(1.03) Any day during which an applicant for citizenship was the <strong>spouse or common-law partner, or child, of a permanent resident referred to in subsection (1.02)</strong> and resided with that permanent resident shall be treated as equivalent to one day of physical presence in Canada for the purposes of paragraphs (1)(c) and 11(1)(d). </p>
<p>Canadian Armed Forces — permanent resident </p>
<p>(1.2) Paragraph (1)(c) does not apply to a permanent resident within the meaning of subsection 2(1) of the Immigration and Refugee Protection Act who has, subject to the regulations, no unfulfilled conditions under that Act relating to his or her status as a permanent resident and who </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(a) during the six years immediately before the date of his or her application, completed <strong>three years</strong> of service in the Canadian Armed Forces; and </p>

<p>Anna is a citizen of Canada residing in Mexico City. For the past 10 years, she has been looking after her nephew, Miguel, since his parents passed away when he was 12 years old. Most recently, Anna has decided to return Canada and has adopted Miguel under the laws of Mexico. Is it possible for Miguel to be granted citizenship? </p>
<ul class="task-list">
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> No, because Miguel is 20 years old and is too old to be granted citizenship based on adoption.</li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> No, because the adoption was not done in accordance with Canadian laws. </li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox" checked/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> Yes, because Anna was residing in Mexico at the time of the adoption. </li>
<li class="task-list-item"><label class="task-list-control"><input type="checkbox"/><span class="task-list-indicator"></span></label> No, because Miguel was not a minor at the time of the adoption.  </li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>Pursuant to <strong>s. 5.1(2)</strong> of the Citizenship Act <strong>adult adoptions</strong> may qualify for citizenship if </p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>(a) there was a genuine relationship of parent and child between the person and the adoptive parent before the person attained the age of 18 years and at the time of the adoption; and </p>
</li>
<li>
<p>(b) the adoption meets the requirements set out in paragraphs <strong>5.1(1)(c) to (d)</strong>. This includes the fact the adoption must have been in accordance with the laws of the country where it took place and where the citizen was residing. </p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>In the immediate scenario, the adoption took place in Mexico where Anna was residing and it appears there is has been a genuine relationship of parent/child for many years. Notably, the question asks if it is possible for Miguel to be granted citizenship, as these as well as other sometimes subjective factors would have to be assessed by IRCC.  </p>

<p>Mark has lived in Canada for the past 20 years, where owns a house and small business. His wife and children are all Canadian citizens. In the last few years, he has had to travel back and forth to the U.K. to attend to his mother who is ill. Recently, he applied for citizenship but it turns out he miscalculated and is 2 days short of the 1,095 days of residence required (i.e. 1,093).

<blockquote>
<p>Following Bill C-16 in 2017, <strong>minors can now apply for citizenship without a Canadian parent, as the age requirement for citizenship has been removed under subsection 5(1)</strong>. A person having custody of the minor or empowered to act on their behalf by court order, written agreement or operation of law, can now apply for citizenship on behalf of the minor.  </p>
<p>This may be beneficial in myriad circumstances such as if the minor has more residence in the Canada than the parents; for example, if they have spent time living with relatives in Canada or in boarding school while parents are abroad. Counsel may also consider this option if there are hurdles to obtaining the parents' citizenship, such as a prohibition stemming from a prior criminal conviction or an active investigation. In certain circumstances, if minors have applied with parents and that application is suspended under s. 13.1 of the Act, counsel may consider filing a separate application for the minors. </p>
<p>B is not the correct answer. Under <strong>s. 5(2)</strong> of the Citizenship Act, a legal guardian who is not a Canadian citizen may apply for citizenship on behalf of the minor child but Canadian citizenship can only be <strong>granted if one of the parents (natural or adoptive) is already a Canadian citizen</strong>. </p>
